        The post's content: So I‚Äôve got 6 shelves worth of children‚Äôs books that are aimed at 8-13y kids that I need to get rid off to make space for my current books and revision resources. I‚Äôve tried to sell them on eBay, but it really didn‚Äôt work and since a lot of them are singular and not collection, no one really wanted them. I don‚Äôt want them to got to waste since they are in great condition, I‚Äôm considering charity as my last resort as I‚Äôve been told they throw away many books if they don‚Äôt sell. I don‚Äôt mind not making any money from it but I really do want them to be appreciated by people.

        The post's title: How does Harry Potter work for kids nowadays?
        The post's content: One of the things I've always found the most interesting about the *Harry Potter* series (and I think one of the reasons it's had so much success) is that each successive book feels like it's aimed at a slightly higher age group. *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* is definitely a children's book, and I wouldn't say that *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* is. For the original generation of readers, this worked out well because we grew up with the characters.

        Comment of interest: 
        would be responded to with [/INST] I was 11 years old when I read the first book (and I promptly read the rest of them within that week). I did reread the series several times, and had a different perspective watch time. I‚Äôd say 10+ and they should be okay reading the full series. Definitely depends on their reading level and maturity in how much they understand, but you‚Äôd be surprised at how much they can grasp/understand at that age - and if there‚Äôs anything too much it usually goes over their head until they come back for a reread. My thought‚Äôs definitely changed on how I view the characters and story over time, but that‚Äôs part of the process so I don‚Äôt really think there‚Äôs a perfect time. For example, for anyone that‚Äôs older and holding off on reading Harry Potter because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs book‚Äù - I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre at the perfect age to go ahead and read it.

        For instance, the following:
        The post's title: What‚Äôs a book that you feel was marketed incorrectly?
        The post's content: By this I basically mean, a book that was marketed as one thing and either didn‚Äôt live up to what was promised or was something else entirely. I feel this is very common practise especially nowadays due to the rise of TikTok leading a lot of books to be simplified down to their tropes. A book I feel was marketed incorrectly is probably Song Of Achillies by Madeline Miller. I read the UK edition of this book, and on the cover the book is described as being ‚Äòdark‚Äô and ‚Äòsexy‚Äô. After having read the book this is pretty disturbing given that the only sexual scenes take place when the characters are very young / underage (all others fade to black). Not to mention one of the scenes is purposefully very uncomfortable. Maybe that‚Äôs a desperate discussion for the sexualisation of queer relationships, it just especially disturbed me with TOSA. It‚Äôs a very beautiful book by all means, but why is it marketed as being ‚Äòsexy‚Äô when it really isn‚Äôt that at all, though maybe it‚Äôs just marketed that way in the UK. What books to you feel weren‚Äôt marketed correctly?
        User's comment history: ['A few reasons. Firstly, it's rare to find it written well. I've actually had better luck with fanfics and fanfic-style shorts online when I'm looking for smut. The balance between plot and sex in a full length novel is much more difficult. Which brings me on to the next reason, which is that when I'm reading a book it's normally because I want to enjoy a story, not because I want to get off on it. This means if an explicit sex scene does come up, it does nothing for me and I'm usually just bored and want to get back to the story. Then there's how it's rarely ever relevant to the actual story being told. The fact that the characters have sex may be relevant, but the details of what happens feel pointless. Hence why I much prefer it when books show the lead up, which is where the important character moments typically are, then end the scene as it begins. It's not ignored, it just doesn't waste time describing things not relevant to the story being told.', 'Unfortunately I have no idea. It is quite possibly a case of certain people with negative views on sex in general lashing out. I'd guess that most of these types of people know on some level that it's unacceptable, which is why they tend to downvote instead of reply. I think you're mistaken when you assume that this subreddit should be more rational and open minded. From what I've seen of this place, there's often an underlying tone of hostility, and a sense of superiority based on what kinds of books they enjoy. I don't know why, but it's the reason I don't often comment in this sub.', 'I finished it, and it does not get better. The writing gets worse as soon as the love interest becomes a love interest, with half the internal dialogue just being descriptions of the ways she's attracted to him and struggling to resist him. It made me feel like I was reading the diary of a 14 year old, when the main character is apparently a 20 year old. I also really wanted to like it because of the dragons, but they're barely in it. When they finally show up almost half way through, I was hopeful it was going to get better, as I was actually enjoying their interactions at first. But then they're just not present for most of it, and even though they have the ability to talk to each other at any time, present or not, there's rarely more than a single sentence spoken to each other. They are not developed at all.']
        Previous user comments on the thread: ['Fourth wing. It was marketed as the new game of thrones and to be more violent and messy than anything seen before. But it was super predictable pseudo-enemies to lovers that was confusingly world built', 'Ok I just started this and I do enjoy it but I can tell it‚Äôs predictable lol does the main character fall in love with who I think she falls for? >!xander!<', 'I‚Äôm so sorry you had to see my comment, but yes. I didn‚Äôt mean to spoil it for you', 'I really love spoilers actually and tbh I had guessed it from her first description when she saw him.', 'It really doesn‚Äôt try to be subtle lol. And I hope you enjoy the series, it‚Äôs just not my thing', 'I think it might just be a good transition to adult books. I don‚Äôt really read many adult books but YA is so meh to me now.', ">I think it might just be a good transition to adult books. It's... really not."]
        Comment of interest: 'If I enjoy it what‚Äôs the problem? I don‚Äôt read a lot of adult books so if I find something I like and read it and that gets me to find more adult books then it‚Äôs worked.
        would be responded to with [/INST] It depends what exactly you mean by ""adult"". If you mean a more mature book, then definitely not. Despite the main characters supposedly being 20, the way it's written makes them sound like mid-teens, with pretty much no emotional maturity to be found. It's also a relatively simple world/plot, and with only a single viewpoint character there's not much to follow. I've read plenty of ""YA"" that is more mature/complex. If you mean the explicit sex scenes, then sure. They didn't really do anything for me, but clearly it does for others, so if you want a starting point for those types of books then it could work. From what I remember it was rather vanilla in that aspect.
