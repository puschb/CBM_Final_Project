      "[\"I have two: 1) Possession by AS Byatt. One of the most breathtakingly brilliant novels made into one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is driven in large part by the male protagonist being a hopelessly introverted, very British, painfully reserved failure of a scholar. He has a complex and deeply intellectual inner life. His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. 2) The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. This has a similar problem. The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place. In fact, the specific locations in the book are kind of these sacred spaces that persist through time and have meaning in part because of where they are in the world. The first book is set in Buckinghamshire. Somehow they thought that making a movie out of this book and setting it in southern California. Nothing in the movie makes any sense.

My interpretation of the book was that the reader has free choice in whether or not to be complicit in Marion's suicide. She has this wonderful, rich imagination and life that we've shared together through a first person narration, and the reader is aware of that, so it's up to the reader to decide if it's worth it, is it right for them to stop her at that last moment before the act.

But they themselves wouldn't be nearly so much better writers than those directors that they could come up with the money shot of the movie scene. And yet these people are mad at them. Because they know deep down they aren't good movie watchers. And they aren't good movie watchers because they don't really like the movies they watch like those\"]\n",

His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character.

The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place.

The plot is driven in large part by the male protagonist being a hopelessly introverted, very British, painfully reserved failure of a scholar. He has a complex and deeply intellectual inner life. His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. 2) The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. This has a similar problem. The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place. In fact, the specific locations in the book are kind of these sacred spaces that persist through time and have meaning in part because of where they are in the world.

      "[\"I have two: 1) Possession by AS Byatt. One of the most breathtakingly brilliant novels made into one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is driven in large part by the male protagonist being a hopelessly introverted, very British, painfully reserved failure of a scholar. He has a complex and deeply intellectual inner life. His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. 2) The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. This has a similar problem. The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place. In fact, the specific locations in the book are kind of these sacred spaces that persist through time and have meaning in part because of where they are in the world. The first book is set in Buckinghamshire. Somehow they thought that making a movie out of this book and setting it in southern California. Nothing in the movie makes any sense.

His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. 2) The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. This has a similar problem. The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place. In fact, the specific locations in the book are kind of these sacred spaces that persist through time and have meaning in part because of where they are in the world.

The plot is driven in large part by the male protagonist being a hopelessly introverted, very British, painfully reserved failure of a scholar. He has a complex and deeply intellectual inner life. His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. 2) The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. This has a similar problem. The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place. In fact, the specific locations in the book are kind of these sacred spaces that persist through time and have meaning in part because of where they are in the world. The first book is set in Buckinghamshire. Somehow they thought that making a movie out of this book and setting it in southern California. Nothing in the movie makes any sense. It's truly terrible.\", 'I would argue that, while both works were published in English, the version of Heart of Darkness most people know is actually a translation from the French original. And that the actual \"heart of darkness\" was the \"civilizing\" mission of France in French Africa. So if we look at Heart of Darkness as a polemic on how France could justify their brutality in Africa with the facade that they were saving the Africans, that\\'s where we find the connections to Conrad\\'s other work, which is far more political and focused on social critique than is usually given credit.']\n",

His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. 2) The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. This has a similar problem. The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place. In fact, the specific locations in the book are kind of these sacred spaces that persist through time and have meaning in part because of where they are in the world.

The plot is driven in large part by the male protagonist being a hopelessly introverted, very British, painfully reserved failure of a scholar. He has a complex and deeply intellectual inner life. His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. 2) The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. This has a similar problem. The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place. In fact, the specific locations in the book are kind of these sacred spaces that persist through time and have meaning in part because of where they are in the world. The first book is set in Buckinghamshire. Somehow they thought that making a movie out of this book and setting it in southern California. Nothing in the movie makes any sense.

The plot is driven in large part by the male protagonist being a hopelessly introverted, very British, painfully reserved failure of a scholar. He has a complex and deeply intellectual inner life. His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. 2) The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. This has a similar problem. The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place. In fact, the specific locations in the book are kind of these sacred spaces that persist through time and have meaning in part because of where they are in the world. The first book is set in Buckinghamshire. Somehow they thought that making a movie out of this book and setting it in southern California. Nothing in the movie makes any sense.

It depends on your particular tastes and hypersensitivity, your mood at the current time, perhaps triggers of your own, whatever. And presentation by the story teller. Ever heard the same story told by two different storytellers when 1 is monotonous and lethargic and the other is ebullient and bracing; one of them you can barely sit through and the other you laugh til you cry?

Yet since he originally wrote them, his plays have NEVER BEEN OUT OF PRODUCTION. Just take a moment and think about that. In 400 years, since he wrote his plays, they have never, ever been out of production. That is something, huh?

It depends on your particular tastes and hypersensitivity, your mood at the current time, perhaps triggers of your own, whatever. And presentation by the story teller. Ever heard the same story told by two different storytellers when 1 is monotonous and lethargic and the other is ebullient and bracing; one of them you can barely sit through and the other you laugh til you cry? Rmbr the old adage, \"There\\'s nothing new under the sun.\" The tale is in the telling. Shakespeare only wrote 1 original play, (loser!):The Tempest. Yet since he originally wrote them, his plays have NEVER BEEN OUT OF PRODUCTION. Just take a moment and think about that. In 400 years, since he wrote his plays, they have never, ever been out of production. That is something, huh?

It depends on your particular tastes and hypersensitivity, your mood at the current time, perhaps triggers of your own, whatever. And presentation by the story teller.

In 400 years, since he wrote his plays, they have never, ever been out of production. That is something, huh?

It depends on your particular tastes and hypersensitivity, your mood at the current time, perhaps triggers of your own, whatever. And presentation by the story teller.

In 400 years, since he wrote his plays, they have never, ever been out of production. That is something, huh?

He just got really old and something about his appearance came off as really delicate at the end, like the wings of a dragonfly (might even be an indirect quote). He sees the protagonist one last time, but I believe it is as if his view already goes beyond him. Spoiler End When I first read the story I was really afraid of the death of my grandfather. And this section just hit right in this spot. I was on public transport at the time, leaning on the door, looking out the window and just started crying. The section was really sad and beautiful at the same time. Love that book. Even got an old copy from the 1940s I believe in Hesses favorite typeface (Unger Fraktur), rebound it and read it again.

And I think because I grew up with the topic starting when I was as young as I was I became comfortable with death being a part of life and my feelings and thoughts got sorted through and talked about with an adult in a safe happy environment. Whereas my siblings really only got those conversations and were faced with those thoughts in the middle of us loosing a grandparent when they were in their teens. That was a very long answer to a very short question, sorry üòÖ\", \"Kinda. I think they'll also be what makes me go to funerals when I'm older, which I find very weird. I haven't been to one since I was 8, but I remember them happening, and it's the same with my grandparents. No one is dying, no one is sick, theirs just death. And I find it really interesting that I've lived long enough and lived long enough with them that it's no longer a taboo to me. I didn't know that death would ever be an ok topic to me, but it kinda is. And it makes me feel like I can be the first to tell my family when something happens to me, or if something happens to them. But yeah. Death is weird.\"]\n",
