At the end of 2021 I set a quiet resolution for 2022 to read 50 pages a day for pleasure, knowing if I set myself a daily time goal, like 1-2 hrs.. well, my mind wanders or it gets late, or.. insert any distraction. Just as pugilist points out, I knew that if I read 50/day regularly, the likelier the chances of getting wholly absorbed in something and experiencing that “vanishing of self” — such a relief! — and then there’d be days where I’d read 100-, 200-, 300- pages. Ok, here we are day 1 of 2024. In 2022 I read 122 books, 32,384 pages, 88.7 pages/day. In 2023 I read 136 books, 35,195 pages, 96.4 pages/day. There are days I haven’t hit my 50, but not many. It doesn’t have to be 50. I think picking a goal that feels achievable is the best approach. Even at 20 pages/day you will gain momentum. May 2024 bring you many happy returns!']\n",

When I started really getting into reading, I’d find that I’d read maybe 1/2 a page then be thinking about getting on my phone, so I started giving myself small goals, like “read 5 pages before picking up your phone.” Now I can sit and read for much longer periods most days, but some days it feels like I read a page then pick my phone back up! A big part of reading more for me was wanting to use my phone less, so I try to remind myself of that too.']\n",

If I'm not, my mind is not in the game, and I will start slacking on tasks, getting distracted more, and quit reading, let alone reading several times a week.
