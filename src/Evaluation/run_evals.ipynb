It depends on your particular tastes and hypersensitivity, your mood at the current time, perhaps triggers of your own, whatever. And presentation by the story teller. Ever heard the same story told by two different storytellers when 1 is monotonous and lethargic and the other is ebullient and bracing; one of them you can barely sit through and the other you laugh til you cry? Rmbr the old adage, \"There\\'s nothing new under the sun.\" The tale is in the telling. Shakespeare only wrote 1 original play, (loser!):The Tempest. Yet since he originally wrote them, his plays have NEVER BEEN OUT OF PRODUCTION. Just take a moment and think about that. In 400 years, since he wrote his plays, they have never, ever been out of production. That is something, huh? So, to ask which books make us laugh...I love dark humor, irreverent humor, Jimmy and Ricky humor, as well as cleaner, more family oriented humor as well, like Brian Regan.

Historically, the US energy policy has been heavily influenced by the oil and gas industry. This has led to fossil fuels receiving far more subsidies and investment than renewables. Additionally, the initial cost of renewable energy infrastructure can be high, which can deter investment until the technology becomes more affordable.

It's literally the only book I can pick up, read for 2 minutes, at any point in the book, and get a laugh out of it. By far the most clever, in a funny way, written book I've read.\", \"While I appreciate the comparison to Seinfeld, it's important to note that The Simpsons and Seinfeld are two different types of media with distinct genres, formats, and histories. The Simpsons has managed to maintain its relevance and quality by adaptating and evolving with the times while staying true to its core characters and themes.\\n\\n         The show has tackled numerous social, political, and cultural issues throughout its run, making it a timeless piece of television. However, it's also true that certain aspects of the show, such as animation style and character designs, have evolved over time.\\n\\n         Ultimately, whether The Simpsons is still considered the gold standard in television is largely a matter of personal opinion. Some viewers may feel that it has lost some of its charm or relevance over the years, while others might argue that its longevity and continued success make it the undisputed gold standard.\"]\n",

But a script does exist. In fact, they did a live reading at Sundance in 2016. I'm going to see I can find it because I want to see how they even approached telling this story.\", \"Agreed! The book's humor is indeed largely due to the ironic narration, which brilliantly unveils the absurdity and grotesque beauty of the characters' lives and their peculiar interactions. The characterizations are rich and complex, and they encourage us to reflect on societal norms and expectations. Ignatius, Myra, Detective Mancuso, and Lana Lee are flawed and flawed characters, but they're written in such a way that despite their disagreeable qualities, we remain engaged and connected to them. Moreover, while Jones might not be the protagonist in a traditional sense, his growth and transformation make him a compelling character we root for.\"]\n",
