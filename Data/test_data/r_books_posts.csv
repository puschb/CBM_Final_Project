"18vt9r5","The worst books I read in 2023 - 20 of them!","Apparently we're not supposed to do ""worst of"" lists anymore, but here's mine anyway! These are books I read in 2023, not many were actually published in that year.

20. Cold Justice by Jonnie Jacobs - It's biggest crime is being really dull. Very standard police procedural with old-hat plot.

19. One Of Us by Kylie Kaden - Your typical Liane Moriarty knock-off. Secrets in the suburbs, etc, with two insipid main characters.

18. Black Water by Jefferson Parker - We follow a detective around as she tries to determine whether a guy killed his wife...but the very first chapter tells us he's innocent! Very boring, zero surprises.

17. The Reapers by John Connolly - I normally enjoy this author, but this was bad. Eight pages to describe an apartment and none of the book is set there? Five page histories of buildings? Life stories for a character introduced in one chapter but killed off in the next? Some okay action bits if you can make it through the first 200 pages.

16. The End Of Her by Shari Lapena - Another author I usually enjoy. Some woman blackmails about five different people and none of them go to the police, and give the stupid, flimsiest reasons for it. The only plot twists are when characters act completely out of character.

15. Just The Nicest Couple by Mary Kubica - Another book with two insipid main characters. One won't shut up about how her whole life revolves around her missing husband. The other is a wet blanket who is completely infantalised by her husband. Only interesting plot development is a daydream.

14. My Husband's Killer by Laura Marshall - A group of people in their forties are still hung up on what happened when they were 20. Twist unveiling of the killer is a cheap, unfair plot device that you can't figure out in advance. 

13. Gone Tonight by Sarah Pekkanen - A book that wouldn't even exist if the close mother and daughter protagonists sat down and had the sort of conversation you would expect a close mother and daughter to have. Zero plot twists. The unreliable narrator twist ending is one you can see coming from literally the start of the book.

12. Silence The Whispers by Cait London - Bad even by romantic suspense standards. Can barely even remember what happened.

11. The Summer Party by Rebecca Heath - Woman who spent one summer with a rich family 20 years ago returns to the area, and follows the siblings around like a wounded puppy, practically begging them to be her friend. Utterly painful.

10. Someone Else's Skin by Sarah Hilary - Woman kills her abusive husband in self-defense. She takes off, and the two detectives flounder around after her, with no reason to do so, because she isn't under arrest - hasn't even been cautioned! - and not in any danger. Main detective comes with the ultra tropey traumatic past.

9. Love Is A Racket by John Ridley - Hollywood loser tries to come up with a plot so he can pay off a loan shark. Misogynistic, homophobic and racist, and not fun.

8. The Perk by Mark Gimenez - A Mary Sue lawyer returns to his hometown, runs for a judge, and looks into the disappearance of his friend's daughter. This main character is utterly perfect. All the women want to bang him, even the lesbian. Navel-gazing, treacly, preachy crap.

7. Good Bad Girl by Alice Feeney - A bunch of unreliable narrators who all know what is going on and why they're doing what they're doing. They just don't bother to tell the reader, seemingly for shits and giggles. When all is said and done, none of their actions make any sense whatsoever.


6. Blood Harvest by Sharon Bolton - This book was 526 pages long and barely anything happened. After the 14th time somebody thought they'd seen something moving in the garden, I was fed up. Get on with it already! The plot is so lackadaisical the villain has to out themselves for no other reason than the book would have been 800 pages long if they hadn't. Title has zero relevance.

5. Snap by Belinda Bauer - I don't read adult thrillers to read about a 14 year old protagonist being allowed to join a police inquiry. Go write a Secret Seven book, for pity's sake! Very plodding, and there's no motive for the murder, which I tend to think is important in a murder mystery/thriller.

4. Jar Of Hearts by Jennifer Hillier - A piece of human shit is in prison for her role in burying her best friend's body and not telling her family where it was for 14 years. The friend's killer was her boyfriend. He became a serial killer and is still loose. She gets out of prison, and some women start showing up dead. The identity of the killer is so absolutely fucking stupid and impossible that it almost feels like a parody of a thriller. Packed full of rape and sleazy teen sex, and an over-focus on the characters as teenagers instead of the present-day mystery. Absolutely awful.
  



  
3. Monster In The Closet by Karen Rose - A cast of thousands in a book with no plot. Except for the antagonist, every character is a complete saint and a complete martyr. A chore to read.
  


2. She Was The Quiet One by Michele Campbell - I don't read adult thrillers to read about teen drama. That's all this was. The only mystery is which twin gets killed. The identity of the killer is obvious. Tedious rubbish.
  



1. Following The Wake by Gemma O’Connor - Perhaps the most pointless, dull and stupid book I've ever read (though not necessarily the worst, lol.) Can't recap the plot, because there wasn't really one. I was actually angry I wasted my time on this.

What were your worst reads of 2023? Did you read any of these and love them? I'm looking forward to 2024 being a better reading year. Please leave suggestions - as you can see, I lean towards mysteries and thrillers!

I read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days.

"18w70cj","Works that challenge the boundaries of what is acceptable?","Hey guys,

A few years ago, I read the early short stories of Ian McEwan “First Love, Last Rites” because I heard that they are very macabre / disgusting and somehow that sparked my interest. And those claims were quite spot-on: I was shook by how gruesome and putrid some of these stories were. That being said, exactly that intrigued me somehow. I thought it was fascinating, how literature can evoke such emotions in a reader, similarly to horror stories, which are able to strike the reader with fear – those are essentially “bad” emotions but it’s still enticing to experience them.

Therefore, I went on a journey and I discovered a few stories which many had also found disturbing. First I read IanMcEwan's “Cement Garden”, then “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” by Harlan Ellison and finally“ V. C. Andrews' “Flowers in the Attic”. All of which included highly controversial and disturbing topics like homicide, torture, incest, abuse, etc.

I think it’s so important that these “taboos” are also exploited in literature and, although disturbing, they give such a deep insight into the human mind, psychology, philosophy, etc.

What are your opinions on this and what experiences do you have with works that challenge the boundaries of what is acceptable in literature? I would love to hear your thoughts on this!",1704143887,142,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18w70cj/works_that_challenge_the_boundaries_of_what_is/"
"18wea4s","The Covenant of Water","My mom recommended the book to me and I put it off for a while because it’s a mammoth and outside my preferred genres, but alas I recently started it. 

Im about 70 pages in, and to be honest I am shocked that there hasn’t been more conversation related to the child marriage. 

I understand the book is historical fiction, and child marriage was very common during that period, and I have no qualms with the story depicting the marriage. But my problem is how heavily it was romanticized. 

This 12 year old girl gets married off to a 45 year old man who is depicted as being this outstandingly kind guy. He patiently waited until she turned 16 to lead her to his room for their consummation. Mind you this man has been raising her from the age of 12. The author goes into some detail of the event and how she feels during it. I cringed.

The girl in the book has nothing but love and admiration for this guy. She talks about how handsome he is and how attracted she is to him. The dude is 50 by this time. Again, she’s 16 and couldn’t be more excited to be his wife and dispatch her wifely duties. 

I’m just… really put off by how it’s being represented as this great successful thing. It seems like a revisionist history. The whole thing made me side eye the author a bit, who is a male also up there in age. But it seems I’m alone in this feeling.

"18wrym7","Books written more than 100 years ago that feel very modern","What are some books written at least 100 years ago that struck you as very modern feeling when you read them?

The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton springs to mind for me. It was published in 1920, but something about it feels so current.

I also think Mark Twain has this modern sensibility in the things he wrote.

In a different way, I think the 1909 sci-fi short story The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster was extremely prescient and felt weirdly like it could have been written yesterday the way it describes how we have become reliant on technology.

"18ws0m8","Are some books better as audiobooks?","Maybe the wrong title to use but bear with me. For context, I have only started to enjoy reading in the last few years, up until my early twenties I hadn't read a single book for leisure but now I love it and always have a book on the go. 

My issue is I'm a slow reader, this is especially true if I'm struggling to get into a book. I have a long list of things I'd like to read and a few of them are history books which can be quite extensive, one of these in particular that I want to read is around 500K words. I like the challenge of reading a lengthy book but I'm wondering if you find that certain types of books are better in audio format?

I know people have mixed opinions on audiobooks and because initially I had to really try to enjoy reading, they feel a bit like cheating. I don't know why it feels this way but I'd like to get over this.

Earlier this year I tried reading On The Road (This is my second attempt) and once again I couldn't even get halfway through.

"18x2mrh","I think I'm at the stage where I don't know what differentiates good literature from bad","E.g. why are the best fantasy books/series you could name (except *maybe* Tolkien) always thought of as: ""That's good for fantasy, but it's not *literature*!"" *Wheel of Time*, *Stormlight Archive*, even *A Song of Ice and Fire* I've seen named ""not that groundbreaking/good/meaningful."" And I said maybe Tolkien because even the Legendarium is starting to be considered less philosophically and more...entertainment like.


Name me ignorant if you want, I genuinelly have no idea what is quality then. Quinn, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Shakespeare, Flaubert, I've basically just now written all the writers thought of as ""Best"" I remembered or read recently. These are all (rightfully!) given their place in the lists and universities of greatest authors that ever held a pen in history.


And yet...I read *Uncle Vanya* by Chekhov and I feel the need to clap after finishing it. I reach *that* chapter in *The Wheel of Time*, *Veins of Gold*, and do the exact same thing. I read *Brothers Karamazov* or *The Trial* and am as amazed as when I read *Ainulindalë* or any of the essays Tolkien had written about Morgoth and Sauron. I read a novel by Terry Pratchett and it is as comical yet as insightful as *Revizor* by Gogol or Becket's *Waiting for Godot* (sure, those are technically plays, but still the comparison works IMO). 


Then again, is all fantasy I mentioned just *kitsch* - it's just provoking strong emotions in me without much depth below the surface? But then - if *Veins of Gold* or *Ainulindalë* are just prettily written sheets of paper, what is **not** kitsch and is real/quality literature - only something written as roughly as *Ulysses* or *Moby Dick*? What does amount to *great literature* if **not** the provoking of strong emotions or characters so vivid they breathe on the pages?



I've talked about fantasy here, but I find myself thinking like this for other ""genres"" (honestly, I hate that term) as well. Is it just me having incredibly *low* standards? Am I just easily impressed? What do you think?


And, as a personal addition:


Honestly, as someone that wants to study literature and languages, I don't know if this ability to enjoy everything (because I can enjoy most stories, whether film or novel, and find *something* incredible about it) will hold me back in improving in that field. But I just have absolutely no idea what is wrong then.

"18x5w0z","I didn't like The Magicians","After browsing reddit looking for books that took place in magical schools, I came across this one.

It starts quite well, Quentin is an interesting figure and, although I think Grossman did a pretty rushed job covering idk how many years of college in a few pages, this process was fun to follow. However, some questions started popping up in my mind, like: Why would a 18 year old boy that studied a lot of physics and was a genius would never question the existence of magic? Why was Quentin not even interested in Alice's experiment? These ones and a lot of others showed me how rushed things were and possibly how shallow it also was.

Then, they left Brakebills and things started going down. Quentin suddenly turned into an alcoholic despicaple a-hole, Penny who is not supposed to be a likable guy is the likable guy, and we don't even know how to feel about the others. They are ALWAYS so depressed even though they do not suffer from any specific thing (and can fucking do magic) and they don't even think about the possibility of being clinically depressed. No one seem to care.

This book just felt to me as a HP kind of story mixed up with some Narnia but ended up being bad at doing both.

It had some cool scenes though. It kept me thinking that if Grossman wrote a more ordinary fantasy novel I would pretty much like it.

The Rip by Robert Drewe, The Dressmaker by Rosalie Ham) or less obvious picks (eg. I’m Not Scared - Niccolò Ammaniti, Master Harold and the Boys by Athol Fugard).

"18xovew","Do you self-insert when you read, or are you more of an observer?","I've been noticing this for a while now. I'm the type who likes to insert myself into the main character, or in case of multiple POVs, the character I can relate to the most. For those of you who can't imagine what it's like, I basically become that character and experience what they experience and feel what they feel. I literally live in the story.  


  
But I've also realized that not every reader reads this way.   


  
The other type is more of an observer or spectator. These readers are viewing the story and the characters from the outside perspective (even if the story is written in a limited POV). They don't exactly feel what the character feels. If the character is in trouble, they might worry about them (as they would when someone they care about gets into trouble), while those who self-insert will literally feel the tension same as the character does.  


  
This is also the reason why some people like wish-fulfillment stuff while others don't get it. Readers who like wish-fulfillment like it because they are the ones experiencing it. Who doesn't like that, right? But for someone looking from the outside, if you don't like said character to begin with, you'll become annoyed and call it quits.

"18xq6ne","Are there any classic books you dislike enough that you will never, ever read them again?","I have two that come to mind: *Lord of the Flies* and *Grapes of Wrath.* 

*Lord of the Flies* absolutely horrified me when I was a 9th grader completing it as assigned reading. You know those English class questions of ""what's the lesson you take from the book"" etc? My main takeaway from the book was: if I ever get stranded on an island with a bunch of adolescent boys I'm swimming away to find another island because that option is safer. I disliked all the characters pretty much from the start and my opinions of them just got worse from there. 

*Grapes of Wrath* - I don't know, maybe I'm just not a big fan of Steinbeck. It was interesting to get an in-depth look at the Great Depression from the perspective of those most affected by it, and get a glimpse at the greed and corruption that made it worse.

For example, I wouldn't be surprised if some people liked Professor Moriarty, the criminal mastermind and Sherlock's enemy. So, the least favorite could be just a boring, annoying, complaining, or ineffective character. A friend dislikes Hamlet, for instance, for those kinds of reason.

Me, I would go with Stanley Kowalski from A Streetcar Named Desire. A brute of a man and sort of what I really dislike in people in general. He is a selfish, abusive, and all around rough character. It helps that in the movie it's portrayed by Marlon Brando and I get some people are drawn to him for that reason, to a handsome, masculine type of guy with raw animal energy, but otherwise, what an unlikable character!

"18xydiw","What's your favorite book featuring a character's slow descent into madness?","People may not agree with me, but Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky is an example of a character slowly going mad. Now I should clarify that I don't mean literally mad or insane. Like pure psychosis. Which is fine if that's what your favorite character goes through, but just saying that I'm speaking in more general terms, like losing grasp on reality and becoming more suspicious, paranoid, and preoccupied with thoughts while also developing a sense of alienation. Like the movie Taxi Driver, where you see how the character, who was not really mentally healthy to begin with, is slowly becoming more and more alienated and preoccupied with certain extreme ideas.

"18y3c28","What books had characters or situations that made you laugh to tears?","Patrick F. McManus was an author who also wrote humorous articles about nature, wildlife, his personal life, and I was sort of reminiscing about him just now. In some of his books, he had repeat characters whom you fell in love with who could be just the most cardboard 2D characters ever, but that's what made them so funny. However, ""humor"" tamps down the kind of funny he brought me.

To this day I remember being a kid, lying on my stomach in bed, reading a chapter of his where McManus—reminiscing his own childhood—wanted to spend the night in a tent in the backyard of his parents house with his best friend and they both were suddenly aware of an axe-wielding axe murderer slowly breathing heavily just outside their tent. Just the idea of a murderer doing that, *not* murdering but just breathing and staring like a monster in a closet, kills me as I'm writing this. It was one of those hardest laughs a book has ever gotten me to.

I know it's not novel or anything, but Calvin in *Calvin & Hobbes* is easily number uno for me. Bill Watterson would have me, as a grown adult, unable to breathe with some of the antics that kid would get up to. I also had a friend who loved C&H and we would read him together and both of us would die, in tears, augmenting the whole scenario because we both had the same sense of humor.

I'm having a hard time remembering any other characters or scenarios in books that would be hilarious to read about. ",1704339845,101,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18y3c28/what_books_had_characters_or_situations_that_made/"

"18yahas","As a survivor, Lolita was oddly validating for me","TW FOR CSA

I picked up Nabokov’s Lolita knowing it would be particularly triggering for me but I was drawn in anyways because I was curious about how H. H. would spin this story from the abuser’s POV. 

A lot of people perceive Lolita as an attempt to garner sympathy for a pedophile but I really don’t see that at all. To me, H. H.’s psyche is exactly how I always imagined my own abuser’s to be. The way he dejectedly describes Dolores rejecting him and how she’s this ungrateful little brat and poor him, is so accurate to how self pitying abusers are in real life. How he tries to draw up this narrative that he really loves Dolores and goes to all these great lengths for her and why doesn’t she love him back?…or when he insinuates that she was flirty and initiated it all. I’ve never seen a portrayal of the mind of an abuser that resonated so deeply with my own experiences. It was weirdly validating as a survivor to read this and know that I didn’t misinterpret those self pitying sighs and repulsive “woe is me” comments…they were indeed carefully crafted attempts to guilt and manipulate and self-victimize. Even the paranoia he experiences for everything around him is spot on! 

H. H. never truly loved Dolores because he really couldn’t even see her as human and in my opinion this book does a great job at conveying the great lengths people like that will go to to lie to themselves and the world. As long as you don’t let him fool you…this is exactly how an abuser’s mind works and I appreciate Nabokov for writing it out this way and materializing the thoughts I always knew my abuser had. Of course I know other survivors might not perceive it this way.",1704365908,462,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18yahas/as_a_survivor_lolita_was_oddly_validating_for_me/"

I love to read. And I love to edit. 
Which means that despite loving this book’s story and writing style, I can’t get over the fact that an editor “read” this and didn’t realize that the author had accidentally sandwiched 2 characters together halfway through the book! 

Spoilers below for Jodi Thomas’ Sunday at the Sunflower Inn 

Basically, she’s got this great romance between a cook and the Army investigator that just rolled into town. Then, halfway through the book the B-plot seems to take over the A-plot and suddenly the love interest has a new job, new life story, and entirely new name! It took me rereading the same chapters multiple times to realize that I think the author originally planned for there to be 3 brothers in the story, then got rid of one and tried to use the love interest to serve his purpose and simply forgot to edit out some of the other stuff. Or the opposite—she only had 2 brothers but ended up needing 3 to do everything she needed to. 

Either way, I’m genuinely livid. I’m sure it was a genuine mistake—but I spent money on this book and idk, I really can’t focus on the story now. The editor brain has taken over.

But the point of this post, is that I have been thinking alot about one quote. 



""It's like when my doctor told me the story of these two brothers whose dad was a bad alcoholic. One brother grew up to be a successful carpenter and never drank. The other brother ended up being a drinker as bad as his dad was. When they asked the first brother why he didn't drink, he said that after he saw what it did to his father, he could never bring himself to even try it. When they asked the other brother, he said that he guessed he learned how to drink on his father's knee. So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.""

Well. When I was finally able to get back into reading, one of the firsts books I read was **Mila Gray**'s *Stay With Me*
  
Here's my review of it (I wasn't on Goodreads when I read it 😅)
  
> I read this in 2019. I can't remember the exact details of why I hated, just that I hated it. Poorly written and extremely cliché. As someone who was in the military, I was looking forward to reading a military centered novel. However I was extremely let down. I've never wanted to puke and simultaneously throw a book out of a window more. Absolutely would not recommend. And no, I didn't DNF it. I finished it in hopes that it would redeem itself but it never did. If I had it in me I would throw this book straight into the trash.
  
Imagine my surprise when I went on Goodreads and saw that it had a 4.2 star rating!! 😱😱😱

It wasn't until recently that I realized that this book ruined the entire romance genre for me. And, honestly, just romance  of any form in any book. 🙃

""Carrying his purchase, wrapped in brown paper and sealed with tape, under his arm, he entered the bookshop and asked for “Martin Eden.” [A novel by Jack London]
      “Eden-Eden-Eden,” the tall, dark woman quickly repeated, rubbing her forehead.  “Wait, you don’t mean a book about a British statesman?”  Or her?
      “I mean,” answered Pnin, “the famous work - a novel by the famous American writer Jack London.”
      “London-London-London,” said the woman, holding her temples.
      Mr. Tweed, her husband, a writer of local poetry, came to her aid with a pipe in his hand.  After some searching, he brought out an old edition of ""The Son of the Wolf"" from the dusty depths of his not very prosperous store.
      “I’m afraid that’s all,” he said, “that we have from the books of this author.”
      -- Strange!  - said Pnin.  - The vicissitudes of glory!  In Russia, I remember, everyone - children, adults, doctors, lawyers - everyone read and reread it.  This is not his best book, but okay, okay, I'll take it.""

In USSR, Jack London was sold in millions of copies, and his novel 'Martin Eden' was one of the most favored by the Soviet readers. The same thing can be said about Theodore Dreiser and his 'American Tragedy', 'The Financier', etc. 

James Fenimore Cooper was also very popular, especially his 'The last of Mohicans' but not only. His whole literary heritage, quite forgotten in the US, was instead acclaimed in USSR. 

Even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, these authors haven't lost their status, as modern publishers re-edit their works. Jack London stands out, with 'Martin Eden' being one of the most beloved books by Russian readers, and 'The white fang' a popular novella among the children.

I remember reading so-called 'Leatherstocking tales' by J.

Then after i've read 10 or so more books like that i listen to my feelings and if some of the unfinished books haunts me still and begs me to read it further then i read 20% more of it and so on.  
Why though?  
1. In many nonfiction books the first 20% usually contains the most value of the book. It's just less valuable to continue reading the same book than to start reading another book  
2. It's a lot of fun! Ideas, authors, topics, characters quickly change with each book and i feel like i'm on a tour around the world of experiences  
3. It reduces fear of big and challenging books. Since reading 20% of almost any book is doable rather quickly then i feel like i can safely take any book on and get to the point where i can mark it as read (20%).  That way i don't have to choose only books that i'm sure i'll finish or enjoy completely. In practice it leads me to picking more adventerously which feels more fun and valuable  
4. It allows me to explore topic through multiple authors. Usually when i want to research a topic i try to pick the best book and read only it. But if i don't have to finish books then i can pick 5 books on that topic. And the value i get will be more than from 1 book  
5. It doesn't feel like i'm abandoning books. No guilt. No unclosed gestalt. Since i aimed at 20% and done it then i don't feel like something is wrong when i put down the book there  
6. It allows me to form a warmer connection with the books i decide to finish still. Since i mark the book as read at 20% and don't count anything if i read further then if i decide to read on then it's because i really enjoy it - there is no secondary stimulus, just my interest. It feels good, like i have an honest connection with the book  
I'd like to ask your feedback on this. How does this way of reading look to you? Am i missing something important here? Do you believe that you can't really read this way? Why? Have you tried something similar? What is your way of reading?  
I feel like there is something not right with finishing books by default and it's not discussed enough. I want to get to the bottom of it. ",1704661573,155,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1912jwb/mark_books_as_read_at_20_progress/"
"19139ej","What are some bad books that you constantly think about","There are alot of things that can make a book bad, or at least make you hate it. Uselly those books get pushed away and only remembered as a warning to not read anything like it. Occasionally there will be a book that you identify as bad, yet you constantly find yourself thinking about it.

In my case that book is ""the virgin killer"" by Jon Stone, An obscure fantasy book I only bought because a YouTuber suggested it. The prose were not that great, the story and world building was a jumbled mess of muddled themes and plot threads that went nowhere. It was the worst book I have ever read, yet it never leaves my mind because of just how wierd it was.

The best way I can describe it is the novel equivalent of the poorly made slapstick comedies in the late 00s like disaster movie. Lobotomized centaurs, vivid description of a fishes genitals, a person dying on the street corner and immediately being cut up and sold as meat infront of a crowds eyes, all wild imagery that sticks in my mind despite me hating the book itself.

So what about yall, is there a book that was terribly written but against your best efforts you just want to talk about it, if so what is it?",1704663268,169,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19139ej/what_are_some_bad_books_that_you_constantly_think/"
"191617q","A Mother's Reckoning is extremely misleading for anyone who hasn't researched Columbine","For those who don't know, *A Mother's Reckoning* is a memoir by Sue Klebold, the mother of Columbine shooter Dylan Klebold. It is generally well-liked as a story of Dylan's upbringing leading up to Columbine as well as a recollection of the grief, guilt and confusion Sue went through afterwards and her journey into becoming a mental health/suicide awareness advocate. I also thought it was great initially, but after spending the time to learn about Columbine, I've realized that not only are a lot of the facts in the book misleading or outright lies, the overarching message of the book also falls flat because of the author's blatant bias in favor of her son.

The first thing that irked me was the author's hypocrisy in how she views Dylan versus Eric Harris, the other Columbine shooter. One of the most poignant messages in the memoir is supposed to be the author's plea for the reader to view Dylan not as an irredeemable villain, but as a kid whose unchecked mental illness led him to commit a tragic act of murder-suicide at his own high school. She even writes that in her own search for answers, she saw her son ""become a monster, and then a boy again,"" but on the contrary, she doesn't seem capable of viewing the other kid, Eric, as anything but a complete monster. 

For example, she claims it's ""not up for debate"" that Dylan was seriously depressed and therefore incapable of making rational decisions (despite admitting that it's impossible to posthumously diagnose someone with depression), while also claiming that Eric was a psychopath who was incapable of feeling empathy, didn't have a conscience, ""lied without compunction,"" and was a manipulative sadist. She brushes aside the fact that Eric was also dead and couldn't be diagnosed, saying that ""expert analysis"" of his journal showed that he exhibited a lot of psychopathic traits. And regarding the journal, she quotes a psychologist as saying, 

>\\[Dylan's\\] journal is markedly different from Eric's in both content and style. Whereas Eric's is full of narcissistic condescension and bloodthirsty rage, Dylan's is more focused on loneliness, depression, ruminations, and preoccupation with finding love. Eric drew pictures of weapons, swastikas, and soldiers; Dylan drew hearts. Eric lusted after sex and fantasized about rape; Dylan longed for true love.""

She conveniently leaves out that Dylan also wrote about his condescension towards others and how he saw himself as a ""god"" compared to normal people (""zombies""), his rage at his supposed mistreatment at the hands of others, how he was willing to kill his friend's girlfriend for stealing him away from Dylan, or his excitement at the prospect of going on a killing spree with the girl he considered his true love.

The author doesn't stop there. She cites Eric's early dismissal from a diversion program as evidence he was an ""overwhelmingly persuasive"" psychopath, glossing over the fact that Dylan was also released early from the same program. She touts the fact that Eric indicated he had both homicidal and suicidal thoughts on his diversion form as evidence that he was disturbed, without even entertaining the possibility that Eric might have also been depressed and crying out for help like she believes Dylan was. On the other hand, she says she felt relieved when Dylan indicated he only had finance and job troubles on his form, and frames his lying as a symptom of depression instead of psychopathy. She admits that Dylan tricked her into thinking he had his alcohol consumption under control, but doesn't think he could have had manipulative (or psychopathic) tendencies. 

Furthermore, she writes a lot about how everyone's been looking at the motivations for Columbine the wrong way—it was a murder-suicide, not a massacre—but is insistent that Eric's motivations were purely murder and Dylan's were purely suicide, even saying that Eric ""went to the school to kill people and didn't care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well."" Dylan and Eric both committed murder and they both committed suicide. I don't understand why she can say so confidently that Dylan's motivations were so different than Eric's when they both showed signs of depression (Eric through his diversion forms and Dylan through his journal) and both showed a willingness to kill other people. In fact, witness testimony (especially from John Savage) and the 911 call transcript suggest that Dylan acted *more* ""psychopathic"" than Eric during the shooting, not less. Dylan was the one acting excited and shouting during the shooting, Dylan was the one who yelled ""Woohoo!"" after gunning down Kyle Velasquez, a mentally disabled student, and while both Dylan and Eric acted racist towards Isaiah Shoels (to put it lightly), it was Dylan who first singled him out for being black before Eric killed him. 

The author also believes that Dylan still had some amount of ""good"" in him trying to counteract the ""evil"" part of him even during the shooting, writing in chapter 12 that Dylan had let four people go during the shooting instead of killing them. Earlier in the book, the author even acknowledged that Eric had also let a person go—Brooks Brown, in front of the school—but she makes no mention of it here. She never considers if Eric could have also had ambivalent thoughts about what he was doing, if he was also struggling with depression, or if he was also a boy deserving of empathy and understanding. She even goes as far as to suggest that Eric's posthumously-diagnosed ""psychopathy"" was an unpreventable, untreatable mental illness while simultaneously lauding the efforts of psychologists in the fields of suicide prevention and treatment of depression. It's so annoying how she takes every opportunity to paint Eric as some kind of freak of nature destined to be evil while lamenting how Dylan's death was a failure of the people around him to recognize how much he was struggling mentally. It's not that Eric was some kind of misunderstood victim either, but I just don't understand how Sue Klebold could dedicate half her book to proving that Dylan was more than a monster—that he was a *boy*—without ever extending the same empathy she asks from us to the only other boy involved in this tragedy. Her book is bad not just because of all the excuses and downplaying of Dylan's behavior, or the oversimplified leader/follower narrative it pushes, but because its author doesn't even take her own lesson to heart. She hates the demonization of her own child but is more than willing to do the same to another if it makes Dylan look less evil.

—————

The other problem I had with the book is the author's misleading narrative that Eric was the leader and main culprit of Columbine, while Dylan was the ""suggestible,"" ""dependent,"" and ""depressed"" follower. ""Eric was a failed Hitler; Dylan was a failed Holden Caulfield."" She continuously romanticizes Dylan's journal, writing, 

>Besides sadness, the most common emotion expressed throughout Dylan's journals—and by far the most prevalent word—is ""love."" There are pages covered in huge, hand-drawn hearts... He fills pages with details of a passionate, painful infatuation with a girl who does not even know he exists.

When it comes to Dylan's bad acts though, she always downplays his actions or describes them in an extremely vague manner before moving on. Even while describing the actual massacre, she finds the time to say that **""Eric had shot his rifle forty-seven times. Dylan had shot three times with his handgun and two with his shotgun.""** Why does the amount of bullets fired even matter? Dylan killed 5 people, Eric killed 8. The author never mentions this in her explanation of the shooting or (iirc) anywhere else in her book, so if you had no prior knowledge of Columbine, you'd be led to believe that the victim ratio was somewhere near 5:47 like she implies. In her description, she also leaves out Dylan's reaction after killing Kyle and says that both Dylan and Eric taunted Evan Todd, when Evan's own witness statement said that Dylan was the only one taunting him (by calling him a fat f\\*\\*k) and Eric wasn't even paying attention. 

To her credit, she does vaguely acknowledge that Dylan generally acted evil during the shooting. She says he ""deliberately killed and injured people. He derided them as they begged for their lives. He had used racist, hateful language. He had not shown mercy, regret, or conscience."" However, she contradicts herself just a few chapters later by suggesting it was Dylan's conscience that allowed him to spare the lives of four people during the shooting. She does her best to pin the blame for Dylan's racism on Eric too. When explaining the ""Basement Tapes"" recorded by the two, she writes that Dylan's racist tirades were a performance for Eric and that he was following Eric's instructions to ""feel the rage."" She pushes the leader/follower interpretation, saying that ""Eric relied on Dylan's slow-burning, depressive anger to fuel and feed his **sadism**, while Dylan used Eric's destructive impulses to jolt him out of his **passivity.**"" 

The author tries to distance Dylan from the shooting by stating it was Eric who created the whole plan for Columbine and that Dylan was conflicted about it all the way up until the shooting. She says he called Eric ""crazy"" and tried to distance himself, but his depression made him see ""Eric's plan"" as the only option. However, Dylan's own journal implies the opposite. Though we can't know for sure who planned it first, he was the first one to write about committing a shooting spree and the first to use the term NBK (Natural Born Killers), the term they later used to refer to their plan. The author also claims Eric tried to recruit two other people before settling on Dylan, but I couldn't find any proof of that either. 

In order to dispute the notion that Dylan was a troubled kid prior to Columbine, the author downplays a lot of his offenses committed in high school, including an incident in which he, Eric, and another friend hacked into a school computer to steal the locker combination of another student so they could put a threatening note in his locker. In her book, Sue Klebold describes this as,

>Digging around in the system, the boys discovered a list of locker combinations. Dylan opened an closed one or two locker doors to see if the list was current, then transferred the data to a disk and shared it with Eric. Zack took it a little further and left a note in the locker of his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. 

She then writes about how annoyed she was that Dylan got suspended for 5 days, saying that ""he'd only opened the lockers to see if he could, and closed them without touching anything."" 

She also spends a good chunk of chapter 12 writing about how Dylan was bullied and at higher psychological risk for panic disorders, depressive disorders, and suicidal thoughts, but spends only two sentences explaining that Dylan had bullied kids himself. ""Bullied kids often become bullies themselves, which appears to be what happened with Dylan and Eric. Larkin cites a student who claims they terrorized her brother, a student with special needs, so badly he was afraid to come to school."" She never elaborates on this, and the statement itself is so brief I missed it my first time through. I don't know if he's the student in question, but Adam Kyler was a special needs kid who was bullied relentlessly by Dylan. During school spirit week, Dylan would paint swastikas on his face, and less than half a year before the shooting, Dylan had told him he would kill him if he went to class and would shoot him if he told anyone about it. The threats only stopped once Adam's mom contacted the school administration. I understand that Sue Klebold is obviously going to be more forgiving of her son's behavior, but the extreme level of omission and downplaying here is kind of insulting. I shouldn't have to go digging around on the Columbine subreddit or the 11k just to find out more about the time her son bullied someone to the verge of truancy; she should have come clean with the details instead of glossing over the ugly parts of his past.

—————

I didn't really make this post to call the author's character into question, but there's also some details about herself that she lies about or leaves out in this book. In chapter 3, she writes about how distraught she felt when she saw an ugly photo of Dylan in the newspaper. It was ""the most terrible school picture Dylan ever had taken, so unflattering that when he brought it home, I urged him to have it reshot."" What she leaves out is the fact that she hated the picture so much, she sent replacement photos to TIME so Dylan could look more photogenic... in an article written about the massacre of 13 people that he had just committed. Even if she was coping or in denial, it's still highly questionable (unhinged?) behavior to be so obsessed with her mass-murdering son looking good on the news. 

In chapter 14, the author reveals that Dylan's English teacher had talked with her about an essay Dylan had written about a man dressed in black gunning down jocks at a school. However, she says that the teacher had never shown her the essay, only claiming the subject matter contained ""dark themes and some bad language."" She then writes that the teacher had compared Dylan's essay to Eric's and claimed that it was more inappropriate, and when her husband asked if they should be concerned with the essay, the teacher replied that she ""thought it was under control."" In 2019, the teacher in question actually wrote a [article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/judithkelly/opinion-i-taught-at-columbine-it-is-time-to-speak-my-truth) in Buzzfeed debunking almost the entirety of Sue's story. 

>I told them about the content of the story, the alarming imagery of people being gunned down. I told them about the disturbing tone. I shared that I had made a copy and given it to Dylan's guidance counselor, who was at conferences as well. I recall being dismayed when Mr. Klebold immediately shifted the conversation to a cerebral, philosophical discussion of teenagers today. I remember being surprised that they did not ask me more. Because of the depth of my concern over Dylan's work, and how adamant I was about it, I recall having the expectation that they would at least be talking to the counselor that night. 

I'm not sure if it was Sue Klebold's intention to manipulate her readers or if she's just incredibly sympathetic towards her son, but either way, I feel like this book fails at being an honest look into the life of a school shooter. It tells Sue's side of the story, but anyone who hasn't dug super deep into Columbine would probably take her words on Dylan as gospel truth without realizing the amount of information she distorts or leaves out entirely. The other parts of the memoir weren't bad; it was interesting to see how she dealt with her own mental health problems and got into activism after Columbine, but I can't help but wonder how many people's opinions on Dylan and Eric have changed because of the narrative pushed in this book.

I’m currently on page 144, out of 400. I’ve been trying to read it for a while now, on and off. It’s just taking me a long time. I kinda get the plot but the vocabulary is just too much for me. I just find myself getting bored and spacing out, having to read paragraphs over and over again. It’s also hard to get back into it when I take a reading break. 
Honestly, most of the character’s big words, metaphors, and daydreaming are just beating around the bush. Filling in the pages with random things to make a longer book. At least that’s what it sounds like. To me, it sounds a little unrealistic if the character is simply writing a letter and saying so many unnecessary things.
Don’t get me wrong, there are parts of this book that are actually good. Parts that I can connect with, when the character gets to the actual point.

I don't feel like this needs much explanation, so I'll just share my personal experience. I was home in the third grade with a long sickness, I almost had to repeat third grade because I missed so much time. While stuck in bed I read many books, but the only one that stands out these days is the Hobbit. Then in fifth grade the Fellowship of the Rings was coming out in theaters. That got me to read LotR for the first time. I loved it then and I love it now. I definitely get more from it now as an adult, although I'm cautious because I know that Tolkien didn't love allegory. But every couple of years, I find Lord of the Rings calling me. Inviting me back in the beautiful story that had become the cornerstone of modern fantasy.

The other is The Stormlight Archives. This is a bit different because it's not all done. But I find going back through the series to give me a bit more each time. Now, I expect that to continue to surprise me on future reads because that's how Sanderson is. He plays the long con like no one else.

"192hwuq","Just finished Project Hail Mary and I need to gush","I just adore Andy Weir. I've loved all three books he's put out, and Project Hail Mary is the best of them all. Essentially an interstellar adventure story of an elementary school teacher who wakes up on a ship in another star system, with the task of saving Earth from total extinction. I won't go into the story, other than to say there's plenty of twists and turns, and tons of great characters.

The science is fantastic and, as far as I understand(which admittedly isn't very far) all perfectly believable, with maybe a corner or two cut for the sake of stories. 

And the pacing is just perfect. I was finishing the book before I knew what was happening, especially as more and more of the mystery unfolds and you start getting more attached to the crew.

If you liked The Martian, like good scifi, or just love a good adventure, I cannot suggest this book enough.",1704815841,442,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/192hwuq/just_finished_project_hail_mary_and_i_need_to_gush/"

This m i g h t get a little political but the word ""marxism"" is a boogeyman word here since it's associated with USSR(which invaded Georgia in 1921) and Stalin, so learning about it was a hard pill to swallow.

"192ul81","Project Hail Mary was really bad","I finally got around to this book after seeing nothing but non-stop praise for it all over Reddit and wow, I honestly couldn’t be more disappointed. Actually I don’t think I’ve been this let down by a book that Reddit has gushed over since Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson.

It’s really the writing that mainly made Hail Mary so hard for me to get through. It’s just so, *so* badly written from a prose standpoint. Like it’s not even just basic and workmanlike, it’s somehow worse than that, at the level of something you’d probably see a junior high school student put out in an essay, or an unedited self-published story on Amazon. It’s shocking that prose of this level actually got past professional editors, and even more shocking that people were able to somehow ignore it. I’m no prose snob by any means but man this was another level of bad.

There’s absolutely zero character development to speak of. The protagonist is just an empty vehicle for the contrived plot. The dialogue and inner monologue is cheesy, annoying and terribly unfunny. Some of this shit reads like corny Reddit humour (maybe that’s why Reddit loves it so much).

The premise is interesting enough but the execution on almost everything is just bad. This has to be one of the worst famous and high-profile books I’ve read in quite some time.",1704846543,105,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/192ul81/project_hail_mary_was_really_bad/"

I have talked about The English Roses by Madonna before and how I thought they were terrible so, of course they're note those for me.

Instead, my two favorites are a tie between The Magic Misfits by Neil Patrick Hariss and The Land of Stories by Chris Colfer as despite them being about different things as one is about magic tricks and the other about fairy tales, they both have characters that go on fun adventures, meet crazy characters and full of character development that leaves you hooked wondering what will happen next and touched as there moments that can even touch your heart.

Also, what's quite interesting as both books are written by well-known LGBTQ actors and in The Magic Misfits, there is a character called Leila who is the adopted daughter of a gay couple, a magician named Mr. Vernon and his husband (of course), which was inspired by Neil himself as he is also a married gay man with kids, and they're written pretty well.

"193nk8o","How does Harry Potter work for kids nowadays?","One of the things I've always found the most interesting about the *Harry Potter* series (and I think one of the reasons it's had so much success) is that each successive book feels like it's aimed at a slightly higher age group. *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* is definitely a children's book, and I wouldn't say that *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* is. For the original generation of readers, this worked out well because we grew up with the characters.

I was eight when I read the first *Harry Potter* book. Within a year I'd read all four of the books that were out at that time, really enjoying the first three but struggling a lot more with the fourth. *Goblet of Fire* was just a bit more dark and complex than I was quite ready for at that point (although when I got older that became my favourite one). For the rest of the books I just had to wait until they came out - and this was a good thing, because in the time in between the release of each new book, I'd gained the maturity to be able to appreciate it when it happened, and in the meantime I could re-read the previous ones and make sure I fully understood them. I was thirteen at the time *Deathly Hallows* came out.

How do kids read them nowadays? What age group do they tend to be recommended to, and do kids lose a bit in the process? I can't imagine having read them all for the first time at any one specific point in my childhood - by the time I was old enough to fully appreciate *Deathly Hallows*, I'd have already outgrown *Philosopher's Stone*.",1704931699,655,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/193nk8o/how_does_harry_potter_work_for_kids_nowadays/"

"1940jng","I thought that ""The Rise and Fall of Third Reich"" would be a boring and tedious slog. I was wrong.","This intimidating large and dense book on a depressing subject has been on my reading list for years.  This month I finally started it.  I've studied military history for years and I figured that there would not be too much new information for me.  I was surprised at the number of fascinating things I was learning about.  The incredible manipulations, lies and various techniques of intimidation and political strategy that Hitler and his cronies used to get into power is certainly something that should be studied by all people of all countries.  I'm a citizen of Canada and The United States and I am concerned at the number of times I have seen certain tactics used by the Nazis used in both of my countries (by leaders and supporters on both sides of the isle).

The book is very large but the author manages to keep each section interesting.  He lived and worked in Germany during the late 30s and his personal accounts are some of the more interesting parts of the book.

There are literally tens of thousands of books on WW2 and I've read many of them but I would suggest that The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich is one of the most important ones to read if you want to understand how a modern people could follow someone so obviously evil as Hitler.",1704976014,303,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1940jng/i_thought_that_the_rise_and_fall_of_third_reich/"
"1946hyl","Is it Weird That I Don't Remember Books?","Whenever my husband and I are reading the same series and a new book comes out. I need to re-read most, if not all of the series over again to remember what's going on. While he can just read the previous book and that's it. 

I've tried to just read the previous book to keep my TBR pile down which, if it's been a year or less, I can usually pick everything back up. However, anything more than a year... It's gone. I don't remember side characters, smaller plot points, background history, etc. I never really thought about this because while I didn't remember the details,  I remember the general outline of the story, the main characters, and how the book made me feel.

For example, I'm re-reading the Red Rising Series by Pierce Brown because Light Bringer came out 6+ months ago and I love this series and I really want to read it. However I also know that I don't remember a dang thing about Dark Age except the Jackal now has a clone and that Brown wrote himself into a corner so he had to bring back Cassius from the dead. Beyond that, I don't remember anything. 

I normally don't care that I forgot those details because it makes the re-read that much better. I get to kind of re-read the book like it's brand new again. - Oh shoot! Ephraim ran head long into a cave full of killer robots with nothing but a broom because he was high on spirit berries! Yeah, forgot that epic moment! That's soo great!

Yet, my husband gets annoyed because he can't talk to me about a series if we aren't reading it together because I don't remember most of it. Now this has me worried. Is this normal?

"194rmox","Mistborn - A Spoiler Free Review","The Mistborn Trilogy really fried my brain. It's an incredible source of brain food for anyone who wants to be actively engaged in reading and decoding the mystery of the plot.

The Mistborn trilogy is a High-Fantasy series (that name sounds so badass - High-Fantasy - damn.) which rests in a world completely different from ours. Our MC is a scrawny sixteen-year-old girl, who suffers from serious trust issues and believes that trusting people will not lead to anything good. As the title suggests, she is also a Mistborn, but I'll leave it at that.

The writing style is refreshingly straightforward. Where most authors focus on finding the perfect metaphor to compare a piece of charcoal with, Brandon Sanderson does none of that, instead focusing simple prose. His writing is by no means boring or lackluster. It is quite the contrary, in fact. Reading Mistborn doesn't feel like reading a behemoth 600-paged fantasy brick, but more like watching a thirty-something hour long movie.

The characters bleed off the page. They form the most uncanny bonds and loyalties. You feel the pain of the characters, their beliefs, their wants, as you progress through the narrative. Never once does it feel that *'oh, the plot needed to happen,'* because the characters motivations and beliefs are deeply woven into the fabric of the story. The different beliefs of the characters give rise to beautiful conversations that explore the theme in subtlest of manners. Love becomes a reason to survive. Characters who are dismissed in the first book save the day in the last. But I'll leave it at that. 

The pacing is neither slow nor fast. It rests perfectly in the middle. There will not be a single chapter, or even a single paragraph in the whole series, which feels like filler. It is masterfully paced, which ties back to when I said that 'reading Mistborn feels like watching a thirty-something hour long movie'.

If that is not enough reason to love this series, I don't know what is. 

I hope I convinced you to read it.

Anyway, I absolutely loved Dune, the first book in the series. I thought it was brilliant, but what surprises me is going online and seeing so many people who apparently didn't get it. I've seen a lot of people talk about how Paul is a hero in the first book and how Messiah subverts the readers expectations by deconstructing Paul as a hero. I've seen people say stuff like you don't really get the full story of Dune unless you read Messiah, and I've even seen some people say that Dune is a white savior story. I'm sorry, but how did people read Dune and not already see what I thought was pretty obvious?

It's pretty clear in Dune that the Bene Gesserit created this prophecy so that eventually they could use it as a means to control the Fremen. Was it not obvious already from the first book that Paul and Jessica were totally exploiting the Fremen and using the prophecy for their own political gain? On the one hand, yes the Fremen led by Paul are defeating their colonial oppressors and ""liberating"" Arrakis, but I also think it was pretty obvious that Paul was becoming their new oppressor, using his image as a prophet and liberator to control them. It's just a different method of oppression and imperialism compared to what the Harkonnens were doing, but isn't that one of the core points of the book? Paul and Jessica's methods were just much more subtle and insidious, and was basically the result of shadowy Bene Gesserit schemes. 

I almost feel like Messiah was written for people who didn't understand the first book, and it is more blatantly spelling out what was already pretty clear from Dune. I think the first book completely stands on its own. Messiah is an obvious continuation of the story, but it is already implied in the first book what the consequences of Paul's rise to power were going to be.",1705202864,111,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19668ey/why_do_so_many_people_not_understand_dune/"

"196m62f","Thoughts on The Rainbow Fish","I have two 1 y/o's and have been revisiting a lot of books I remember from my childhood, one of those being The Rainbow Fish. My issue is re-reading it I'm not sure I like the (I assume unintentional) message. I understand what the book is TRYING to say but the analogy of the main character being a fish and the scales being a part of their body is kinda weird. I know the message is meant to be don't be vain and share with others but it more feels like get rid of things that make you special and people please so the other kids will like you",1705256057,245,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/196m62f/thoughts_on_the_rainbow_fish/"
"196qqjd","I just finished Flowers for Algernon, and I don’t think I will ever stop thinking about it.","It is almost 2, past midnight while I am writing this, and even though this is not the first time I have stayed up late to finish a book, I felt it so extremely necessary to actually pen down, how absolutely devastatingly beautiful this book was. It usually takes me a while, to escape into a world of fiction, when I pick up a book, a chapter maybe two, but, this particular book had me on ropes from the first paragraph probably. I completely disassociated myself from my present, and legit lived alongside the main protagonist, as if I was watching him live the story through out. It takes a lot to tear me up, but there were several times, i caught myself with tears streaming down my face, without me even realising it. This easily makes the BEST book I have read so far, and will probably have a huge chunk of my heart, no matter how many books I pick up, from now. This is probably my fourth time, attempting to convey through words, how much this book has moved me, but I am still finding it extremely difficult to form complete sentences to describe how I am feeling right now.

I am pretty sure, a lot of people would have read this book, way way way before, and I am reallyy late to post about it.

"196tv3y","What were the books you dreaded having to read in school, but ended up enjoying?","If the book is exciting, or engaging, then ill enjoy it.

I remember our teacher telling us to read Beowulf (the modem translation) and I immediately thought ""oh god this is gonna be so boring"" but it ended up being one of my favorite books I've ever read.

Holy crap, this book (originally written somewhere in the 10th century or possibly earlier) ended up being almost more action packed than most Hollywood blockbusters.

Another book I dreaded reading but also ended up being a pleasant read was To Kill a Mockingbird. The characters were complex, the lesson learned was sad but still holds up today.

Honestly the only book I had to read that I absolutely hated was Lord of the Flies. The dialogue was so dry and clinical I struggled to stay awake reading it.

"196u85k","What was a book that is notoriously ""difficult to read"" but you had an easy time with?","I've got two of these for me. Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, and Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy.

Gravity's Rainbow is somewhat of a gatekeeper's book, because it's infamous for it's complexity, hundreds of characters, and prose being a mix between rocket science and lowlife buffoonery.

For me, I thought the entire book was a blast, and I read it with no problem. Sure, some sections *are* incredibly dense with scientific lingo and discussions of philosophy, *but*, it balances it with probably the funniest writing I've ever read. Seriously, the only other book to make me laugh this hard was probably ""Harris and Me"" by Gary Paulson.

For me, Gravity's Rainbow was just FUN. Because of my ADHD monkey brain, I get bored very easily, and every few pages either the subject, narrator or even writing style/prose changes. I read this book very easily, and I can't wait to re-read it because I know I only maybe grasped 25% of it on my first read.

#Blood Meridian.

Blood Meridian, on the other hand, took me by surprise. From what I gathered online about it's reputation, it's one of the hardest books in the English language to get all the way though mostly because of the Sadistic and pointless violence. What I wasn't told, however, is that this violence is written in the most beautiful, poetic and euphoric way. 

I think it's this dissonant dynamic that kept me reading. Say what you want about the works of McCarthy, but the guy was Faulkner's greatest disciple and has some of the best writing the world ever saw, period.

Yes, the violence is as hardcore as you've heard about it, but if you can stomach it, this is a DAMN good book.",1705276351,652,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/196u85k/what_was_a_book_that_is_notoriously_difficult_to/"

"1976o66","Found out my friend returns books right after reading them.","Today, I received a book I ordered online while my friend was over. While I was ripping open the pacakage, she noticed my visible disappointment. 

I told her that the book looked used. Generally, I don't mind buying second-hand books, but I bought this expecting it to be brand new. The sides and corners of the cover are peeled and some, broken. The cover also has some traces of ink.

She then told me that someone must've bought it, read it, then returned it. That it's normal and that she has always done that since amazon lets you return books for free within 15 days, and other places, such as local bookstores, within 7.

I was both surprised and appalled. She must've noticed. She frantically tried to explain herself. The economy, the prices, etc...

Personally, I found her actions wrong and tried explaining to her the losses the publishers and the bookstores face because of this, instead she got mad at me, accused me of hinting that she was a thief, told me I was terrible friend, and left.

Sadly, I am now just stuck listening to these highly addictive stories and still cannot fall asleep, but that's not the point.

The point is, that these books are absolutely wild. I had never read them before and only know Holmes through being one of the - if not the - most referenced literary figure in the western genre tradition. I have seen various adaptations of the stories over time, but never read or listened to the originals. So imagine my surprise when I found out a good third of the very first book is a re-telling of the founding of Salt Lake City and the villains in that book are basically described as being evil because they are Mormon! And then you start the second book and while I've heard that Holmes uses drugs in the original books, I didn't expect the first chapter to basically be ""Holmes uses Cocaine intravenously, because he's bored"".

The main character, Jazz, is one of the worst protagonists I've personally experienced from several perspectives.

Firstly they knowingly and intentionally make incredibly poor choices for little to no reason other than to seemingly add drama to the story. They also treat every single person in their lives with arrogant contempt, from their overbearing but well meaning father to old friends or even random people. Everybody gets shat on in one way or another because what apparently makes a compelling protagonist is somebody completely incapable of forethought and empathy? This also seems to be viewed from the lens of the author as totally justified and reasonable (or at least it is so far) and that makes it even worse.

Which is odd considering she is also a super cool mega smart engineer smuggler crime girl who can do basically anything. It's mentioned explicitly at multiple points that she could do basically anything she set her mind to. Unironically. 

She also is incredibly hot and likes to apparently think that to herself multiple times a day, constantly referencing how banging her body is or how she has a reputation for being easy because everybody wants to sleep with her. Like normal real people totally do.

This all culminates in reading like a horny teenager's fantasy woman crowbarred into an underwhelming story. Except a lot of the dialogue is also written very much in the style of what a 51 year old man thinks people in their 20s talk like i.e. complete rubbish. Lots of strange inappropriate slang, overly flippant reactions and unnecessary and unfunny quipping.

Context -  I am reading autobiographies of 20 most influential men in history. Currently I am reading Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. So what happened was, a close friend of mine was coming to my home to borrow some books of mine. She sat and asked which ones do I have so I took her to my shelf. There she was browsing through and I left her alone went to the kitchen for some snacks or a soft drink. Suddenly I heard something drop, she came out of the room , shouted ""you nazi"" and stormed out. I went inside the room and saw my Mein Kampf book on the floor with everything haphazard. I didn't know how to react as something like this had happened to me for the first time. I gathered my books AND myself and sat down in thought. I stayed still and kept thinking for like about half an hour which btw seemed like an eternity. I couldn't arrive at anything to be honest. Every thought of mine came circling back to a single question. Will reading a single book make me something regarding the book?. If it had been some horror or fantasy or anything apart from this, it wouldn't have mattered to me in the slightest. But I really really really cannot process how to think about this incident. So I got up and called a mutual friend of ours. I told her everything and asked if I did something wrong. She her exact words were "" I don't know if you did something wrong or not, but i can surely tell that you made a mistake by allowing her to see that book"". I am at my wits end here. I care about my friend but I am thinking that she is over reacting as it's just a book and she should be mature enough not to judge a book by it's cover ( pun intended, including not judging me too in this case).

"19976wb","I don’t get the hype behind Brandon Sanderson","I don’t read a ton of fantasy but there are some series that I’ve enjoyed greatly. The obvious LOTR and A Song of Ice and Fire duo, as well as stuff like Gormenghast, Book of the New Sun, Thomas Covenant and Realm of the Elderlings. 

Sanderson seems to be one of the biggest (if not the biggest) fantasy authors around so I finally decided to give his works a shot. I first attempted Mistborn and then gave up halfway through the second book. Then I tried Stormlight - supposedly his magnum opus - and gave up halfway through the second book there as well. 

I found the writing and prose to be really wooden and juvenile, and pretty much at YA levels. And combined with that was the dialogue, which seems to be composed of mostly unfunny quips and faux-profound platitudes. 

Idk if it’s just me but the books feel really mechanical and formulaic, and like…video games almost? Like they literally feel like they’re broken down into the prologue tutorial, the first level up, the first boss fight, the obligatory cutscenes etc. just really strangely formatted and structured. Doesn’t help that there’s just way too much focus on how the power systems and magic abilities and everything work. Pages upon pages dedicated to how each special move or ability is supposed to function. Why is this a thing? 

Characters are all shallow archetypes as well, and each one seems to have one or two basic traits assigned to them that act as character development. 

The interaction between the characters is so weird as well. No one speaks like real people to each other and any time any kind of romance or female characters are involved, it’s just exceedingly cringey. 

There’s some interesting worldbuilding I guess but other than I was really underwhelmed.",1705524246,1959,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19976wb/i_dont_get_the_hype_behind_brandon_sanderson/"

For me it felt like Sarah J Mass has a huge problem with telling and not showing. In Throne of Glass the heroine is introduced as the world's number 1 assassin, no one is better at killing than this 19 year old, she's a total badass and pretty damn sexy to boot. But we're not really given any context as to how she became this badass, then she spends half the book worrying about what dresses she'll be wearing and doing no actual killing. She's in a competition to the death and is more worried about the hunky guard and what he's up to rather than, I dunno, surviving?! Couldn't stand it. 

My friend kind of half spoilt some of the surprises in the later books to try and convince me it got better, but without spoiling anything they just made me think it was a bad soap opera but in armor. 

So then I was told with confidence to try ACOTAR, as this series was more ""adult."" But on the very first page the heroine is complaining that she's not beautiful because she's ""too skinny."" I did the biggest eye roll before making the quickest DNF decision I've ever made with a book.

But it cannot be denied how unbelievably popular these books are. Especially on TikTok. There is a never ending pile of memes, fanart, playlists all based around these books. Sarah J Mass seems to be the queen of YA, and I've started to see her books appearing in the adult section of the fantasy shelves.

 >The Salinas Valley is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay... The Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from the open sea, and they were dark and brooding—unfriendly and dangerous.... From both sides of the valley little streams slipped out of the hill canyons and fell into the bed of the Salinas River....The floor of the Salinas Valley, between the ranges and below the foothills, is level because this valley used to be the bottom of a hundred-mile inlet from the sea. The river mouth at Moss Landing was centuries ago the entrance to this long inland water.

>Stern was closest, so I started there, at the shielding that separated payload from propulsion. A single sealed hatch blistered the aft bulkhead dead center. Behind it, a service tunnel wormed back through machinery best left untouched by Human hands. The fat superconducting torus of the ramscoop ring; the antennae fan behind it, unwound now into an indestructible soap bubble big enough to shroud a city, its face turned sunward to catch the faint quantum sparkle of the Icarus antimatter stream. More shielding behind that; then the telematter reactor,... I could see almost to Theseus’s bow, an uninterrupted line of sight extending to a tiny dark bull’s-eye thirty meters ahead. It was like staring at a great textured target in shades of white and gray: concentric circles, hatches centered within bulkheads one behind another, perfectly aligned.... The shuttle-access hatches to Scylla and Charybdis briefly constricted my passage to either side. Past them the spine widened into a corrugated extensible cylinder two meters across and—at the moment—maybe fifteen long. A pair of ladders ran opposite each other along its length; raised portholes the size of manhole covers stippled the bulkhead to either side. Most of those just looked into the hold.

"19abk7i","What is your opinion about Bullshit Jobs by the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber?","In it Graeber argues that a lot of our jobs are bullshit, so they don't contribute to society at all, they just waste our time and give us the source of income. We live in a culture where you have to justify your own existence through the job and because of that we are having more and more of those bullshit jobs that do nothing, they just give us money necessary to stay live. We are essentially cogs in a big machine that should probably work us, while it seems like we are meant to work for it. 

I think this happens because of how our society is structured - people who make decisions and the top society don't have good understanding of what is happening on the local level, so because of that they have a tendency to create a lot of inefficient processes that make us waste our lives, which is unfortunate consider that they get disproportionate rewards for their own roles, which as we can see make us waste a lot of time of our lives.

One Unwind procedure is covered in detail and describes how the kid starts losing sensation of this part or that part of his body until eventually it is just his brain being taken apart piece by piece; it causes him to relive memories of being a baby in his crib and crying for his mother who had left him all alone until eventually he fades out as the last bit of his brain is taken.

Iliad, odyssey, the beautiful and the damned, shakespeare plays, p&p, anna Karenina, dracula, classic fairytales, you name it it's gonna have a retelling. (Classic fairytales aren't as bad for me as the rest but i had to mention them)

Now i know this isn't a new phenomenon. Wide sargasso sea changed the way a lot of ppl view jane eyre years ago. I wouldn't mind it so much if it didn't impact the way the original works of those retellings are viewed. 

Like sure someone could argue Achilles's and patroclus homosexual attraction/relationship is already implied on the iliad and I'll tell you sure. However after song of achilles ppl have come to view patroclus as a fem twink... Spoiler alert lol he wasn't.

If not for wide sargasso sea ppl wouldn't think of rochest as the worst scum on earth. Don't get me wrong Rochester isn't perfect and certainly not a good or moral person but a good part of the hate towards him comes from ppl who read the unofficial prequel. 

I find ppl say they make retellings to reclaim the misogyny the og works have but that just isn't a good enough excuse for me.(like the author of lies we sing to the sea who wrote a odyssey retellings when she hadn't even read odyssey herself bc she wanted to add a feminist touch to it). 

I see so many new books coming out or books that have already been out that seem interesting like lady Macbeth or a dowry of blood but I can't love past that these aren't an original work. It's like I will be reading fanfiction of an already existing book. 

And that isn't to say fanfiction is bad but they aren't 100% original characters to analyze they'll always exist within the realm of the original work.

Someone could argue that nothing is 100% original in fiction and while i agree it's one thing to get inspired and a whole other to literally grab a character that already exists and give them a personality makeover to fit your fantasy.

And the thing is that I think many of these books may be actually good books. And I'm all for representation. But representation for me should come form new characters and stories not an old book getting a rebrand for a cashgrab. 

Bc lets be real some books wouldn't get half the attention they're getting if they weren't marketed as retellings of this or reimagining of that.

And at the end of the day what i dislike the most is that many of these characters could actually be very interesting on their own and the books they're in may be considered classics one day. But no, bc now they're tied for eternity to their predecessors.

Idk this is the end of the rant but my point is that i hate thw current trend of retellings.

In college and high school, I often used audiobooks for school-assigned literature. This way I could get through difficult texts I’d usually struggle with via regular reading.

Since I’ve graduated, I’ve noticed I tend to do the opposite. The more high-effort the book is, the more likely I am to read it with my eyes. These days, the best audiobooks for me are essay collections or novels told in a relaxed, conversational style. I usually listen to them while exercising/driving/doing chores, so I prefer stuff that I can still follow even if something irl grabs my attention for a few moments.

That said, I’m flexible. The only hard rule I have is that I don’t listen to any high-concept sci-fi/fantasy. If the book is filled with a bunch of unfamiliar-sounding names and terms, I need to see them written down if I’m gonna remember it.

I am just curious about how different people navigate predicaments with their loved ones especially when they get offended my your book opinions.

I’ll give my situation just to provide one predicament. I haven’t been reading much the past few years but self reflections have brought me back to books. Several of my friends have been reading ACOTAR. I didn’t really know much about it other than it’s fairly popular with TikTok readers. 

One of my good friends said her and some of the other women in our friend group have been reading the series and they loved it. She said she thinks I would really enjoyed it and said a bunch of things praising the book.

I started the book last week ish and finished it a couple days ago. About 75 pages in, I felt like I was reading something that resembles stories from quizilla 15 years ago. (No hate, I spent too much time on that site as a teen.) Around this point I texted her saying that I started it but wasn’t really impressed with the book but would reserve my final thoughts until I finished it.

Anyways I finished it and sent her a message today saying that if I went in with my expectations lower it was mildly entertaining. I said that it’s similar to keeping up with the kardashians. No one watches that show for anything profound but for pure entertainment. I made some comments about things I felt were weak in the book. She responded and said I haven’t even read the full series and the first book is the worst.

I responded that it wouldn’t be unreasonable to call me a snob. But that I would read the 2nd book to see if it improves. This was a half joke.

"19bqy1y","Is there any example of women writing men very very badly?","There is a large number of author who write women dreadfully. Some male authors depict female characters as sexualized, unrealistic beings who are mere accessories that meet the desires of these authors.

An egregious example is Murakami:

“Scattered amongst the “normal” parts of 1Q84 are overly-detailed descriptions of female adolescent body parts. One of the main characters, Fuka-Eri, is described as a 17-year-old girl with “large and perfectly ripe breasts.” The novel, often from the male protagonist, Tengo’s, point of view, continues to objectify Fuka-Eri through it all––specifically, her chest as she’s sleeping, walking into a cafe, or simply breathing.”

Another is Terry Goodkind:

“Just to give you a taste of what to expect: In book 1 of his most famous series, “The sword of Truth”, he introduces an entire warrior cult that is just straight up magical women in full leather BDSM gear with several chapters just solely dedicated to the main protagonist being tortured by one of them in a bondage session (I’m not even kidding…) Also every woman that isn’t a main character is either overly lustful, evil, there just to be raped or some horrible combination of all three.

If you have a first edition but a later printing that is still very rare (such as T*he Hobbit* or *Dune*) then go ahead and mention it.

I have 1st/1sts of *Snow Crash*, *Ender's Game*, *Dune*, *Hyperion*, *Salem's Lot*, *The Great Hunt*, *The Short-Timers,* and *The Stand*.  My copies of *Snow Crash* and *Hyperion* are signed.

As *Snow Cras*h is signed, I believe that is the single rarest 1st/1st that I have, as only 600 hardcover 1st/1st copies were printed back in 1992, making it one of the smallest first print runs.  Probably only half of those have survived over the last 32 years, and I would imagine only a fraction of those are signed.

"19c5xnp","1Q84 is disgusting","The initial installment of 1Q84 demanded patience due to its gradual pace, but I persevered given the widespread acclaim for Haruki Murakami's work. The second book, however, gripped my attention more profoundly. It appears the first book serves as an introduction, while the second delves into an elucidation, building up to the climax.

The portrayal of Aomame's friendships struck me as peculiar. The depiction of her engaging in sexual relationships with her female friends raised questions, as her sexual orientation is not explicitly revealed as bisexual. It seems like these descriptions cater more to a male fantasy, akin to a porn scene between two women that falls short of authentically portraying a lesbian relationship.
 
The discomfort intensified as Tengo, a 29-year-old man, described the breasts of Fukaeri, a 17-year-old girl with dyslexia. But for me, the end of the road wasn't reached until the middle of the second book. In the first book, we encountered a 10-year-old girl who was raped before her menarche and her uterus was torn apart. The leader of the group then used moral relativity to explain that it was not a voluntary decision, that his penis would only get harder, and him lost the control about his own body,  while some girls had sex with him. After Aomame kills the leader, the protagonist of the story goes through the same situation. His penis initially hardens from Fukaeri's youthful scent, which is described as something only young girls can smell, like the high school bus in the morning (which in itself sounds like a pedophile). He then fell asleep and when he woke up he couldn't move. The sex scene are depicted as Fukairi's duties and desires, and her hairless genitals are depicted in a manner similar to Vladimir Nabukov's in ""Lolita.""
 
What scares me the most is that the work introduces the theme of sexual abuse of girls and then plays a game of moral relativism in which adult men are exempted from this guilt. Tengo's descriptions of his sexual experiences with his penis, including descriptions of the size of his organ's penetration deep into a small teenager body, are disgusting. The book defends Tengo's pedophile behavior, while him seems to portray the hero of the book. I don't know if I have the energy to read a third book, and I'm still trying to understand the hype surrounding this author.His works are described as fiction, but they seem more like a justification for pedophilia.",1705851295,123,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19c5xnp/1q84_is_disgusting/"
"19cekig","Worldbuilding is out of control","I read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/198urw2/getting_a_bit_tired_of_books_spelling_everything/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about how books can be too obvious, and I think worldbuilding is one of the worst offenders of this. 

Rare is the fantasy book that doesn't have a meticulously crafted universe where every conceivable detail is accounted for or the author confirms wild fan theories. I understand that some readers/fans enjoy the scale and depth of a universe, but too often I find that it makes the world less interesting. Part of what makes a book fun for me is *not* knowing everything about the world, that some things are intentionally mysterious or unclear, and authors dropping little hints that allows the audience to debate the possibilities. Our own world is full of mysteries and will never be solved, so why should fiction be any different?

The most painful example of this is from one of my favorite series, *Cirque du Freak*. (If you've never read it, a young boy becomes a vampire and finds out there is an entire vampiric society and culture.) In the fourth book, one of the main characters explains that vampires believe they evolved from wolves, much as how humans evolved from apes. This was *so* cool to me as a teenager because it was a simple yet elegant blend of evolution and fantasy that just kind of worked.

Fast forward to the final 20 pages of the twelfth and final book where a different character says ""You were actually created by an omnipresent being for their sick games. The evolution thing was just a story they created."" That twist did fit into the series' larger theme of ""how do you break out of a pre-destined future"", but it also torpedoed one of the most interesting fantasy worlds I've seen in a series and kind of ruined it for me.

TLDR: I think writers should have more respect for their readers' intelligence and allow them to either figure things out on their own or leave more of their world ambiguous and up for debate.",1705873085,410,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19cekig/worldbuilding_is_out_of_control/"

"19ctirl","Non-native english speakers, how much do you read books in original english vs. books translated into your own language?","This is a dilema I have to face every time I chose a new book: should I read in original english or the translated version? Most of the greatest books (or at least the ones I want to read) are written by UK/US authors and I can read in english with full understanding. 

Sometimes the translated books can feel weird to read, because some of the phrases, which may sound good in english, will usually sound funny when translated in my native language. For example, I have read the first book of game of thrones in my native language (lithuanian), just because that book was laying around in my house. The way they translated ""bastard"" into ""pavainikis"" (which is the correct term for this context) just doesn't fit and sounds very funny in the dialogue. When Jon says ""But I'm a bastard!"" in english this word sounds very harsh and mean, but when he says it translated version ""Bet juk aš pavainikis!"" it's just so punny and very silly. I actually laughed a bit right now. Also, I have no idea how the translators handled the Hodor and ""hold the door!"", because in lithuanian it's ""laikyk duris"". I have no idea how they managed to go from ""laikyk duris"" into Hodoras. But the translations are not bad all the time. For example, I have read Orwel's 1984 and Animal Farm in english and also checked a few sections from the translated version. Both versions are fun to read and the lithuanian version seems to get the writing style of the author. So usually the translated books are hit or miss. 

The reason why I have this dilema, Is because I want to improve my native language speaking skills as well as my writing skills. I am exposed to so much english everyday, that it seems that it makes me sound like an NPC when I talk in my native language. And I guess I just miss the feeling of reading in lithuanian. But at the same time I don't want to miss out on what the author truly meant with his words and I really want to get a feeling of their each individual writing styles, which I might not get when reading the translated versions.

It’s hard to explain its appeal. It feels like the first sci-fi book I’ve enjoyed that rests at the intersection of a relatable today, and glimpsing a far-off tomorrow. I love the Dune series, for example, but I struggled to visualize how humanity would arrive to that particular fantasy setting. This in no way reduces the quality of storytelling or my enjoyment. but definitely impacts the overall verisimilitude of the world. 

In Hyperion’s case, however— Music is played on pianos and not some obscure sci-fi instrument. People drink and eat familiar foods rather than neon-colored “Glee-glorp.” The story, itself, involves relatable characters as though it were our world just centuries into the future. All while injecting some excellent science fiction concepts and visual storytelling.

While I’ve yet to read further into the series, I am excited to experience more, and curious if there are any other fans with thoughts on the subject.

This mystery/thriller book involved four murders, and none of them would have occurred if any of the victims weren't unlikable and loathsome individuals. I feel like this is one of the most common complaints about books in general — characters being unlikeable and unrelatable.

I understand the frustration with unlikeable characters *if they were intended to be likeable but were poorly written*. Many books have characters meant to be likeable or neutral but end up being total a-holes (for instance, Pedro in ""Like Water for Chocolate"" is an utterly despicable person, which doesn't make sense in the context of the story, yet I didn't see many readers noticing that at all). However, **the main point of many books is to have unlikeable characters**. Otherwise, there wouldn't be conflict, and the plot would be incredibly dull and ridiculous, or even non-existent. I wonder if people who complain about unlikeable characters, obviously meant to be so, are aware that most fiction books would be boring and essentially the same if every story only featured nice and likeable characters being sweet to each other.

There are times when yes, a character is a vessel for an author's views, but most often, it is not.

"1abzmjj","I hate the use of imagery","I can visualise complex scenarios, I just don't retain the scene because of imagery.

I find Shakespeare easier to comprehend due to it being a play; its just dialogue with little to no imagery.

Too much imagery makes my brain skip the whole part, and inevitably this makes it impossible to retain what I just read. Even if I read word by word, it doesn't matter or change a thing; it just gives me a headache.

A user's post [*Why can't I comprehend any book I read*](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pvqnk9/why_cant_i_comprehend_any_book_i_read/) summarises my issue with reading novels. 

I prefer to read only mangas; many here would suggest I cannot visualise hence the substitution for mangas however, as stated earlier, I can retain plays too.

The best supporting argument is the following: recall when your friend was telling you a story about an event that occurred, and, instead of describing unnecessary details such as the time of day, the weather, how they were *really* feeling, etc. etc. they cut the long talk and stayed on topic. They told every little detail without much imagery, and this is why I can easily recall stories from friends but I cannot recall a single thing from novels.

Another point: in the 8th grade, I noticed my struggle with this problem because I never used to read books except *Diary of a Wimpy Kid* (though it has drawings, it lacks imagery, again proving my point) so when an assignment asked to read *Half Brother* by Kenneth Oppel (horrendous book) I could not keep up with the plot, characters, themes, or anything useful. Instead, I started reading summaries and synopsis on the internet and this made me more educated on the assigned material than the entire class that read the material, word for word. 

Equivalently, I did the same for my 12th grade essay: I was assigned to read Gatsby and I read 3/4 of the book, however, as the essay's due date was approaching, a person who's read only 1 page was more educated on Gatsby than I. Again, I searched for summaries and found my answers.

All summaries have 1 attribute in common: they lack imagery and are direct. I cannot read Dostoevsky or Kafka or any book because it has too much imagery for me to understand the material.

It enrages me how illiterate I am and how I cannot enjoy Dostoevsky or Kafka like every person does. I want to enjoy *Crime and Punishment*, *The Brothers Karamazov*, *The Idiot*, *White Nights*, etc. but I cannot because of how disgusting the writing is to me.

Another book I like also starts off in the same way, but I have no idea how it does. (It's effective in context but doesn't seem like the first thing you would think of?) Neither of them are particularly sexual (although they do deal with some sexual themes in a way that I don't think is meant to be titillating) or even unorthodox (they're hopeful + tend to play into traditional social ideals despite the ways they subvert them), but it gives a certain impression if I ever mention them

They both start off with scenes of unexpected male menstruation in which they can't find any period products + get dysphoric over it. One is a high school boy who switched bodies with a girl of the same age when they both fell into a swimming pool, and the other is a middle-aged trans man who was busy with work and had to severely delay his shot appointment

Also I love talking about either book (altho it's been a while since reading them) so feel free to ask more about them if you're curious about their plots. I think they're in an interesting intersection of sort of, simultaneous individualism and collectivism + their social critiques/insights were engaging. I don't necessarily agree entirely with all of their messaging, but I loved reading them just because I hadn't seen anything like it before even in my native language (altho that could also be b/c I hadn't read very many good English books at the time). They both use themes that are so often made cliché, light, and artificial as opportunities for raw yet uplifting portrayals of humanity.

And she's touching his butt, repeatedly. so much so the guy has to shift the lady's hands up north again and again. it's also established she's drunk BUT has been dancing with any single or married young man she can find to make her ex husband jealous.   


do you know what fmc does when the mmc looks at her with pleading eyes? Fucking turns around and giggles like???   
the scenario(with the fmc) was crossing lines and being creepy sure, but the mmc was literally getting harassed? especially repeatedly even when he tries to not let old hag's hand wander and he get giggles? this scene is wrapped up so quick and its so freaking disgusting.

And I barely remember anything about books I read more than four years ago except the overall plot and general idea, no matter how much I loved reading it back then. Maybe it’s because of how I was younger and reading things more mindlessly but this gives me a feeling of uncomfortableness as if I can’t count these books as finished and I'm being a liar when I say so. I obviously can’t read them again when there are so many books to read and not enough time.

I stopped somewhere in the middle of Wizard and Glass. I don't know why but I just simply lost interest in it somewhere in the beginning. I kept reading because I don't like to leave a book reading unfinished.

One day I just chose to not read because I had other things to do that day. ""I will continue the next day,"" I said to myself but this next day turned into next week then next month and I forgot about it. Maybe the fact I was binge-reading the series made me tired of it. 

After that, I ended up often not finishing other books. I know it's not a bad thing since I can use the time I would spend reading those books on reading others that will interest me, but I still feel some kind of guilt when I choose to dnf a series or a book.

Is my comprehension just low or something?","For some context: I'm a 30 year old, well educated guy whose first language is English. I am an engineer by profession so never read much beyond elementary and high school. I'm a pretty casual reader now. When I was younger I didn't read much beyond what was required in school (or less, with the help of cliff notes). I never enjoyed ""literature"" and always hated when my teachers would ask me to find some deeper meaning or hidden theme in the required reading.

Nowadays when I read for fun I like to have a good mix of fiction and non-fiction. When it comes to fiction I mostly read sci-fi or fantasy novels. I was getting worried that all the fiction I was reading was at like an eighth grade level and I wanted to pick up something, I don't know, more age appropriate I guess. The Screwtape Letters sounded interesting and fun.

First couple chapters were entertaining. I understood what I was reading insofar as I knew this was from a demon's perspective, talking to his underling who was trying to get his human to turn away from Christianity. Beyond that though, I had no clue what I was reading beyond the most basic level. I obviously comprehended the words on the page and sometimes could gather what was being talked about. But I finished the book realizing that I had no friggin clue most of the time. I guess it was about temptation and the tendencies of human beings that the devil seeks to exploit?

I'm mad at this book because it started out great. While the characters were not particularly likable, it was interesting to see where their lives would lead. The interview format wad also interesting for a while. However, I couldn't read it past the halfway mark (right about when the two bands met). Daisy and Billy were insufferable together, and there was both too much and too little petty drama somehow. I might give the audiobook a try later though.

-Verity by Colleen Hoover
I went into this book completely blind, as per my friend's recommendation. They said it was a great thriller, and since we have a similar taste in books dor the most part, I picked it up. The only positive thing about it is how easy and quick it is to read. The plot however, is full of holes and logical errors, and it's downright ridiculous at times. None of the characters were interesting or even remotely likable.

I may be the exception here, but I am usually judging the book up front on its cover, genre, and blurb, then if it sounds good enough I'll dive in and usually go to the end.

Does any one else have a problem with casual androcentrism in so many books? With that I mean books that have like 70-90% male characters, the main character is a man and you know this is shit. Because they contribute to the fact that about 70% of all fictional characters are male and of all main characters. Of all the heroes and antiheroes, of all the characters that are actively doing, thinking, and women are just supposed to feel represented even though they are not. Feeling accurately represented makes people more confident and happier bc you feel you're worthy of representation, and the world systematically denies that to women and then you have a book before you that contributes to just that. How do you deal with that?  
Because that one book isn't the problem. The author could have chosen more women but they didn't, but probably the reason was ignorance and not malevolence. Still, you're reading it and it's hurting you and the world. Do you completely shut that out and enjoy it anyway or do you only read books that have >=50% women and the word ""humandkind"" instead of the word ""mankind""?  
For me, especially for contemporary books, when the male authors really could have known better but they don't it is really hard to enjoy these books. I was reading The Martian with my bf and we ended up downloading the pdf and rewriting it to have the main character being a woman. Now it's doable for me, otherwise it was just to hurtful to see this horrible disgusting androcentrism in action as a perfect example in this book over and over.  
But am I overreacting? My ebook reader is away for repairs right now and I had to pick up a physical book :D I took Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close out of the shelf and unfortunately, it has the same problem. It would have been so much better and fairer if the curious and intelligent kid main character was a girl and the dead and super intelligent and completely worshipped parent was a woman, too. Basically all the characters' genders reversed. But it isn't. This man didn't think of that or didn't care that women are underrepresented as is and he is contributing to that, even though it would have been so easy for him and it would not have changed the book otherwise AT ALL. Now this physical book I can't rewrite with PDF programs and it's also a lot of work :D

"1ago2en","Do you read obscure / unpopular books? How do you feel about them?","By saying unpopular, I don't imply any kind of superiority, due to being noncommercial - I mean simply books that aren't popular currently.

Classics don't belong to this category. After all classics *are* popular.

Unpopular book can be anything. It can be old bestsellers that aren't currently in fashion. It can be genre fiction, it can be literary fiction... doesn't matter. The only criteria for this definition of ""unpopular books"" is books that are right now not read by many people.

Now that I've clarified semantics, I would like to ask, do you read unpopular / obscure books?

How do you feel about it?

I don't often read such books, but sometimes it does happen. Most often when I find some old book in my personal library, that has been collecting the dust for decades. Such books are typically not very popular. Maybe they had their days, but now they've fallen into obscurity. This happens to most books from the past, regardless of genre.

Only the best books from the past become classics. All the rest, become more or less obscure, even if they were popular when they were new.

How do you approach such books?

How do you feel when you are among just 10 or 20 people who have graded a book on Goodreads?

For me it's a bit lonely feeling as it's hard to find someone to discuss the book with. On the other hand such books become a part of my unique experience in life that's shared with few other people.",1706827677,161,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ago2en/do_you_read_obscure_unpopular_books_how_do_you/"

I guess I hadn't had much to eat that day because the effects started rather quickly, and I was pretty much stoned before getting to the end of Tolkien's forward.  
  
My original intent wasn't to read while high, but I guess it kind of snuck up on me.  And what a strange difference it made- I was so engrossed in the story that I felt like I was there at the birthday party.  I think I read a lot more closely, and slowly, than I would normally.  There were a couple of times I had to re-read a passage after getting distracted, but in the main I paid more attention than I have in the past.  Things like word choice and phrasing really stood out to me.  
  
The book seemed even more epic than it normally does too.  I don't know if that's just because I've read the LOTR so many times that I miss most of the detail nowadays or if being stoned just ""embiggened"" the story.

"1ahqnzb","Why do some women say they don’t want to read book written by men?","The other day, I was telling my friend how I excited I was to start reading Brandon Sanderson and get into his work (Emerald Sea, Mistborn series). She straight up told me she doesn’t read books written by men. My internal reaction was super confused. 

There are so many male authors out there that have created staples in genres I love, especially fantasy and sci-fi. Heck, I grew up reading amazing YA series written by male authors like Percy Jackson and Maze Runner! 

But the more I thought about my friend’s comment, the more I kind of understood. Men can sometimes have a bad perspective when writing women. The only prime example I can think of is in classic literature such as The Great Gatsby. However, a great deal of classic literature was written by men if you think about it. Back then, women could not publish their books publicly. 

I think as women, we unintentionally or not chose books written by women because we desire a well-rounded female protagonist and a female perspective. Not saying all men don’t get women. I think part of it is readers want more representation especially for BIPOC or lgbtq+ which may be written by women. 

What do you think the reason is? And should this matter for future readers? What are your thoughts?

Update: it’s been an hour and I can’t believe there’s so many replies. I have opened up a whole debate.

"1ahvy8u","People who criticize books like the lord of the rings and Moby dick for too much meandering don’t understand what adventure really is like","I was talking with someone about the lord of the rings books vs movies recently and my friend said he had always struggled getting through the books because of how much walking, singing, and descriptions of mountains there were. I hear similar criticisms with Moby dick: the only action happens in the beginning of the book and the last few chapters; the rest of it is just a dude musing about rope and the nature of the sperm whale’s tail while sitting doing nothing on a ship. 

But I’ve recently gained some more perspective on this. Having started volunteering for peace corps in Africa several months ago, my American friends have this idea that this must be a never ending adventure and I’m so lucky to be out here seeing this exotic part of the world while they’re stuck in their corporate entry level jobs. And yes, it has been an adventure in a lot of ways. I live in a village of mostly mud huts; have eaten freshly slaughtered rabbit and more whole fish than I can count; have had a dramatic run in with some crooked cops; have met chiefs; and have navigated the country in a series of 12 seat vans illegally seating 20 people. 

But what is the day to day like of adventure? Sitting in my house alone reading a book and waiting until work starts since things don’t typically operate on schedule. Sifting through and copying down all-paper health records for hours so that we can trace immunization defaulters and try to remind them to come to the health center, even though a lot have made up their mind it’s not important. Walking around the village and sitting in random people’s huts while drinking their tea and listening to them speaking a language I may understand 40% of. Staring at my wall in frustration as one of my project ideas is thwarted because we don’t have the resources or there’s been some corruption in the bureaucracy. Musing about why the world is the way it is and what the role is for an individual in attempting to fix it. 

In other words, yes, adventure is climbing Mount Doom and chasing Moby Dick, but it’s also a lot of sitting, a lot of walking, and a lot of waiting around for the next big moment to happen. It’s forging a harpoon in blood for a few minutes just to stare at the ocean and debate the taxonomy of whale classification for the next few hours. 

To me, that’s part of the subtle genius of Melville and Tolkien: their adventure epics capture what an adventure is actually like. Instead of writing never ending action, the authors opt for a slow burn with much more emphasis on world building and philosophy. I sometimes wonder if this is because both authors were genuinely adventurers. Melville had years of sailing experience that he based Moby dick on, and Tolkien was a WW1 veteran.  Both men knew what a voyage or war really was, and wrote it.

Perhaps you’ll disagree. I also like more straightforward adventure books like the Jules Verne novels. I love epic poetry like Beowulf and The Odyssey, which tend to just jump from action to action. But overall, I don’t think anything can beat the subtlety of the lord of the rings and moby dick in capturing adventure’s true nature.",1706966391,555,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ahvy8u/people_who_criticize_books_like_the_lord_of_the/"

There was a suspense throughout the book because you KNEW Winston would get caught, it was just a question of when. It read kind of like a horror story where you know the terrible ending from the beginning, but can't change it. 

I'm surprised though at how crude it turned out to be. Not the book itself, but the government described in the book.

The Party is describes to be intelligent, all-knowing and sophisticated. So when Winston is captured, I imagined all sorts of terrible futuristic things happening to him.
Imagine my surprise when what they did was kick and hit him. It was the Party saying: obey us or we will kick you for days! We will torture you with rats!
The punishment for resistance was so primitive. And for me It was enlightening, because so much power is upheld just by someone having more force than the other. In the end the Partys power had nothing to do with intelligence. In the end, power was just about the crudeness of physically abusing someone until they agreed.

"1ahzfi1","The lack of appealing teen literature is causing teens to stop reading","I am speaking on this as a teacher and as someone who knows a lot of teenagers.

When I was a teenager not too long ago (2011-2016), there was a lot of literature for teens. It ranged from romance, to mystery, to horror, to non-fiction,and pretty much any genre you could imagine.

There are still books from that time I go back and reread just because they were so amazing.


Now, there seems to be so few age appropriate books for teens. A lot of teens (girls especially from what they talk to me about), enjoy romance books. The problem is, their parents/guardians don't want them reading the romance books that are popular and shown all over the Internet.

While there are some good age appropriate romance books or even any genre of books for teens, it seems to be an area highly lacking.

If you go to the library (at least the one near me and near my work) they have the kid secrion, a young adult section, and an adult section.
The young adult section is rated for 17-24. The kids section is rated 0-12. The adult section is for 25+. And while people are free to get whatever book they want within reason, they seem to not have good places or books for 13-16 year olds.

So they either read books for younger kids, which for that age range is seen as the end of the world, or they read books not always appropriate for their age.

A lot of students have complained and so have other teens I know that they love reading, but can't because they feel they have nothing to read. 

I would love to see authors publish more books targeted at teens that are high quality and engaging.",1706976392,108,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ahzfi1/the_lack_of_appealing_teen_literature_is_causing/"

I was a child when Harry Potter came out and I had avoided it my entire life, until I turned 24 and finally read it (I've read it twice in full since then, and on audiobook). So, this isn't a brag, but just to show you that I am stubborn and when something is popular I am usually avoiding it.

So CoHo, became kind of a joke for me and my colleagues. I'm an adult librarian, and I would have days where every patron was requesting a Hoover book. My system has all of her books, and there are at least 300 copies of each in the system, that's how big the demand was. The hype has died down considerably, so when my friend asked me to join a book club, and told me it was for a Colleen Hoover book, and I saw it was available on Libby, I read it.

And since, I've read 3 of her books. 

So, as stubborn as I am, I'm not a snob with books. It doesn't take much for me to like a book. I'm not too critical. I just like a book that will grasp my attention enough that I WANT to read it, bonus if it has some unexpected twists and turns.

I have seen so many people -- on this sub and others -- shame people who read smut. I've seen people go as far as to say that smutty romance books have no substance or literary merit.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with sex. Sex is a common part of many romantic relationships and a common part of *life*. There is nothing taboo or wrong with talking, thinking, or reading about sex. Just like there is nothing wrong with NOT talking, thinking, or reading about sex. It's personal preference. The issue is that people who don't tend to see themselves as high and mighty; a more sophisticated breed of romance connoisseur.

If you want to read a book about people who don't have sex, go for it. There are *millions* of books out there that are perfect for you. In fact, the vast majority of books are completely sex free. You can even skip explicit sex scenes in some books, if you really wanted to. You would not be a better or worse person for doing so. You can do so without hating on others.

An argument I've seen a lot has been that all smut books are ""trauma porn"" and ""r@pe fantasies"", which could not be more incorrect. So many of the explicit romance books I've read have been beautifully written with complex characters, twisting storylines, and meaningful relationships. That's because I decide what books I want to read, based on the content. If I don't want to read dark romance, I don't. If I don't want to read a mafia romance, I don't. It is that simple. 

I don't see people hating on graphic horror fans for being disgusting or ""murder fetishists"". They find beauty and enjoyment in reading these books, because they're well written and enjoyable. If you find graphic horror uncomfortable, you just don't read it. You don't shame those people for being ""gross"".

"1aizmsc","One-Hit Wonders, Mediocre Follow-ups: Name your favorite inconsistent author","I’m currently re-reading one of my favorite books of all time: The Rook by Danial O’Malley and it got me thinking how Mr. Danial struck lightning in a bottle with this one. 

The story is original, the world building is fantastic, the whodunit aspect is engaging, the book is charming, witty and teeters the line between silly and serious very well and then you read the sequels and while they’re great books, they just don’t compare. 


The best character in the series was always the protagonist of the first book, yet they are relegated to the sidelines in the second book and is basically an afterthought in the third. The subsequent novels also seem to have unnecessary side plots that add nothing to the overall story and seem to break the pacing often.

"1ajcsp6","What happens when you are outgrowing the popular best sellers but aren't ready for the classics?","Hi, 24M here, been reading novels since the age of 10.

I am finding myself at a very peculiar position, wherein I tried reading War & Peace - my first try at a classic, and got only up to 2/3rds of it before jumping on to lighter stuff for a while. Its been a year and I am yet to get back to War & Peace.

In the meantime, I have enjoyed reading 'A Gentleman in Moscow' by Amor Towles & Hannibal by Thomas Harris - neither classics but much more refined popular fiction.

And this year, I am trying my hand at Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe - I love historical fiction - and I am again struggling with the language, especially the biblical dialogues.

So, again I jumped to one of my favourites growing up - Jeffrey Archer's Honor Among Thieves - and I am finding the writing quite shallow!! Something I have never thought about his books.

"1akf4e1","Three-Body Problem","I saw a preview or ad about this book becoming a show on Netflix. I’ve been craving a good scifi for sometime now and like all book to tv/movie adaptations, I quickly got the book before the show is even out.

I’ve never read a Chinese author before, one cause I clearly can’t read Chinese but also I’ve never really seen any praise for this author before. So excuse my ignorance, perhaps he is far more popular than I realized. Apparently he is renowned for his scifi writing in China.

I was apprehensive because it is translated to English. I was worried the artistry would be lost in translation and perhaps some of it was but my god was this book awesome!

First off, he uses real science. Quite a bit of it if I’m not mistaken and it’s so wonderfully creative. I was hooked from the beginning by the brutal way Ye’s father was killed. It was such an interesting story and really refreshing to read an author who is from China, grew up Chinese, and clearly expresses the authoritarian power of communism. 

The way signals are sent to space, who received the signal and how one of the main character’s uncovers the whole story is incredibly well done. 

You first think he is just logging into some VR game but the premise of the game was amazing! It’s about explaining the physics of a world that has 3 suns. And of course this is very relevant to the overall story of the trilogy.

Simply put- this was an amazing work of fiction. I could imagine the world of 3 suns (Trisolaris) and it’s all from the descriptions, science, and excellent story telling and I can’t wait for book 2 to arrive.

A friend and I were discussing the Harry Potter books and brought up the people in the paintings. We found ourselves immersed in questions. Are these ""painting people"" distinct consciousnesses from the real people they were based on? Does their consciousness just spring forth the day they're created, with all the ""real"" person's memories magically implanted there, like Blade Runner? Are they maybe not conscious at all, just imitating human beings enough to pass the Turing test? How do they feel about being on display for all eternity wherever their owner chooses to put them? Is there an entire mirror of the real world off-canvas, so to speak? If not, how much of a world is there? And so on.

It has been many years since I read the books, so forgive me if these particular questions are explained and I've just forgotten.

"1alc0lx","Prose is not a spectrum from Simple to Flowery","First, please put away any pitchforks. I’m not here to make value judgements and tell you your favorite author sucks. For context, I grew up reading mostly genre fiction (mostly YA, horror, and sci fi), then had a big nonfiction phase, and now read more literary fiction with the occasional genre book.

I see a common misunderstanding on this subreddit and other fiction subs that prose (which is basically the word choices and writing style in a novel — the “voice” of the author) is either basic and functional or it is flowery and stuffy. You *allegedly* can either have language that only conveys its direct meaning or you have 3 pages describing a vase which is a symbol for lost love or something. This is not true at all, and I suspect this belief a byproduct of American high school education. I used to believe it myself to an extent. Because even though I came around to “the classics” eventually, I absolutely hated high school literary analysis as a teenager.

But it isn’t true, prose can be both beautiful and straightforward. Or simple and still somehow excessive. Or none of those. It can be obtuse or haunting or terse. It can be rhythmic or sublime or coarse. Lots of options, because there are pretty much an infinite number of ways to say the same thing. More creative prose takes a little more conscious attention to read, but it can also add *a lot* to the main elements of the book (plot, characters, world, etc). There’s a big payoff sometimes.

To try to prove it, I’ll leave some examples in the comments that show a range. I’ll avoid authors that are very divisive on this subreddit, and stick in some genre fic with good prose as well as some literary fiction that generally wouldn’t be taught in high school for various reasons. I’ll also avoid older writing since that’s a worse jumping off point for most.

"1algjzs","Are there actually any decent books on Kindle unlimited?","My fiance got me a Kindle recently and it came with three months of Kindle unlimited. Cool, I thought, tons of options at my disposal. Except I haven't had any luck finding things that are actually good. 

The books I've seen included in Kindle unlimited seem... super generic and bland. I read some samples from like half a dozen different 4+ star books in the fantasy and sci-fi genres (my personal favorites) and they all kinda sucked? I know fantasy and sci-fi are tough genres to get right and the breakdown ends up being like 40% terrible, 40% mediocre, 15% good, 5% fantastic, but still, I was disappointed.

I am assuming that the majority of books on Kindle unlimited are either public domain works or books from new or unknown authors. Is there some secret to finding good books on unlimited? Or is my assessment that it's a dumping ground for mid-authors hoping to get enough of a following to start charging accurate? 

Perhaps I'm just being impatient/lazy and not taking enough time to find the good stuff. Is there a better place to search through Kindle unlimiteds catalog? The annoying navigation and terrible organization does not inspire me to spend tons of time searching for better options.

P.S. My library card is expired and I won't be able to get it renewed until next week, which I know is going to give me access to a much broader selection of ebooks.

The more it rained, the worse they suffered. The worse they suffered, the more they prayed that it would continue raining. All through the night, men looked at the sky and were saddened by the stars. All through the day, they looked at the bomb line on the big, wobbling easel map of Italy that blew over in the wind and was dragged in under the awning of the intelligence tent every time the rain began.

"1amnjfo","What’s a book that has left you dumbfounded at how bad it was?","For me, it’s definitely the Witcher novels. The first two books, The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, were books with each chapter being its own story. It was just a collection of great and interesting short stories, each focusing on a new character and their problems.

Then I moved onto the novels, and I have never been this disappointed in a book series. In fact, I hated them so much, that it absolutely killed my drive to read for a year. The first book was okay. It was pretty boring, but I didn’t expect much seeing as it was setting up the story. 
Then I realised that all his novels are like that. Every novel contained about 15% of relevant story, while the rest was focused on random name drops or characters that were never relevant again. For example, a 40 page chapter would go on and on about a random King or location and what has happened there, never actually revealing what the event was. Imagine someone coming up to you and discussing the last chapter of a book series without revealing what has happened to provide context. This doesn’t happen once, but almost every chapter.

Then you have the different POV’s. Instead of the book focusing on the interesting characters such as Geralt, Yennefer, Ciri, Triss or Dandelion, a large quantity of the novels is from the POV of random characters, who once again are never mentioned again. There was a chapter in the 4th novel that had an interesting, edge of the seat moment, then it randomly switched perspectives to a random soldier who was discussing how best to proceed in raping the women for ten pages.

That brings me to the 3rd issue; the rape. Why is every character either a rapist or is raped? Geralt forces Yennefer to love him through a wish. Yennefer forces / manipulates Geralt into sex with magic or manipulation. Triss, using Geralt’s amnesia, tricks him into thinking she’s Yennefer to have sex. Ciri is also later sexually assaulted.

"1amrfyx","Controversial: Reading habits of most modern day readers.","I’ve noticed a lot recently that many people will review a book and say that they disliked it or will call it poorly written because “nothing at all happened in it”. While I think this is probably true for a lot of books, I see it a lot where I don’t think it’s true. 

I feel like many readers now a days are only hooked by a book if there is constant action/major events occurring and don’t care for minor character development, worldbuilding, scheming, behind the scenes planning, figuring stuff out etc. (this is also true for things like movies, video games etc.)

As an example: I recently read the poppy war. Which I’ve only ever heard amazing things about. I liked it, but thought it was overhyped. The entire series is just constant action and trauma. Which I didn’t really care about because I didn’t get connected to any of the characters due to almost zero character development other than Rin. 

Another example being mistborn. I liked book 2 way more than book 3 because there’s a lot of development about the world at large and also with characters like sazed tindwyl and the ventures. And ten-soon. But book 2 is often described as the worst one when I honestly think book 3 is. Book 3 is almost all action but little substance.

I’ve found there’s a >50% chance this character will be the victim of a scene describing sexual assault. While I fully believe we should acknowledge the harmful and violent reality that sexual assault is rampant and a horrific crime that disproportionately affects women, I feel it’s too often used as a device to cheaply write pathos or a “critical branch point” in the character’s backstory or plot development particularly for female characters. This is even worse when the assault is graphically described in a way that makes the scene a detailed spectacle, almost written to punish the female character for her strength (especially when written by male authors). I feel that male characters are often given a more diverse range of setbacks or challenges to drive plot and character development. I would love to hear other readers’ thoughts on this problem- any worse offenders or authors who write these situations well? Any tips for handling this feeling as a reader?",1707545608,179,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1an9oza/the_risk_of_being_a_strong_female_character/"

"1answ7j","Books that you felt wasted your time","For me, the most recent and extreme example I can think of was when I listened “The Stand” by Stephen King.  

I read so much praise online and decided to give it a try.  I listened to the Complete and Uncut edition so it was about 48 hours long.  I was intrigued during the first half of the book.  Sure it dragged a bit at times, but it gave me the sense that it was all leading up to something incredible; an epic last “stand” one might say. I could not have been more wrong.  

I have never been more disappointed in a book ending.  It was made worse by the fact that so much time and effort had gone into building up the main characters, only for their efforts to not matter in the end.  So much incredible world building and character development was trivialized by a lackluster ending.  If I could get those hours of listening back, I would probably use it to listen to the entire kids bop discography or something more worth my time.

"1aob9st","Books are an unusually demanding artistic medium for both consumer and creator","Social media posts get flicked by in milliseconds. A painting can be glimpsed in seconds and a song heard in its entirety many times before someone ever thinks to purchase it. Even films or video games can be distilled into minute-long trailers, and with a picture telling a thousand words it can say much about the plot (not to mention the ‘feel’ that can be conveyed by music and cinematography). 

The contract between author and reader is a tough sell - you dear reader, fork out the full price of the book and dedicate hours of your life to read it before knowing what it’s really about and if it will be any good. 

I’ve always loved reading but it is only after writing my own book that I finally appreciated just how hard it is to convey an entire novel to prospective readers. A title. A cover. A blurb. A first chapter if you’re lucky. Reviews can be bought and both bestseller lists or booktok can still be full of rubbish. Libraries remove the financial cost but the time is arguably much more valuable anyway. 

A book has great entertainment density, hours of enjoyment per unit of money spent. It can be an island of peace in this crazy world, a chance to disconnect from doom-scrolling and binge-watching to enjoy things at a slower (and more mindful) pace. Particularly when going back to reread an old favourite. But, amidst the flood of new books releasing each week, it is a huge challenge to judge a book’s potential value, particularly when ‘expensive’ is now also a measure of time in this modern entertainment landscape.",1707667335,185,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1aob9st/books_are_an_unusually_demanding_artistic_medium/"
"1aofkuj","Complex female characters in literature","Now with the end of HBO's series Succession I can say that I love to read or get to know more female characters who are real, whether they have development or not, but at least they are fascinating when it comes to analysis, who are human but who can make us laugh. Shiv Roy seemed to me to be an example of a character who was hated by her fandom but she is that type of person you can encounter in life who superficially is a bad partner, a bad sister who always seeks her own benefit, but although she has these characteristics, we like Shrek we can see the layers, and shiv being a woman whose father never gave her a chance at his side like his brothers, she always has to have another plan or other opportunities behind, I know they hate her for those betrayals she commits, but being the youngest and the one with the least experience, I understand why she seems too desperate to be in the CEO position, because she search for his father’s love, something that in the end none of the siblings achieve in its entirety. 

GRRM also, although he has his flaws, he has created characters like Daenerys who is looking for a home, Arya who is looking for revenge but really just wants her family back, Sansa who is looking for security and happiness like in those stories that she liked, Cersei is evil but she is understood when she had a father who did not consider her heir because she was a woman and those limits that were imposed on her affected her in a way that she seeks to be equal to her father, which means being the worst person she can be.

That said life is busy, I have a family and work full time so it's hard to spend time on books especially as I'm still learning what kind of books I like.

Right now I'm choosing a physical book to read when I can and I really love this, but I'm also using Libby to check out other books that I know I wouldn't have the time to commit to like long sprawling sci-fi adventures and literature classics, biographies and so forth..

Personally I'm so glad that audiobooks exist because it's opened up a whole lot of opportunities that I would otherwise miss, I can listen all day at work and smash out a book a week but obviously it's cognitively a different activity and it's hard to absorb all of the information to the same depth as reading a physical book sometimes (although this too can have it's difficulties)

Is there a rule that you don’t rate books if you’ve only read a certain amount, is it all rated no matter what (whether it’s 1 or 100 pages read), other reasoning?

"1aov215","Machiavelli's the Prince is not sarcasm","I have come across so many posts on the internet saying that Niccolo Machiavelli's the Prince is sarcastic. This couldn't be further from the truth. If you read the book more than once, you'd notice that Machiavelli regularly backs his statements with reason. His logic at no point seems ridiculous or sarcastic. 

>For this can be said of men in general: that they are ungrateful, fickle, hypocrites and dissemblers, avoiders of dangers, greedy for gain; and while you benefit them, they are entirely yours, offering you their blood, their goods, their life, their children,...when need is far away, but when you actually become needy, they turn away.

>He that is good at all times will come to ruin among the man masses that are not good 

>It cannot be called virtue to kill one's fellow-citizens, betray one's friends, be without faith, without pity, and without religion; by these methods one may indeed gain power, but not glory.


The book overall makes very serious arguments bounded in reason. At no point does it sound sarcastic. We can never know what Machiavelli thought while writing the book. It was addressed to Lorenzo di Medici shortly after the medicis exiled Machiavelli from Florence, which is why many people argue that it is sarcasm. Machiavelli either wanted to show the medicis that he could be useful to them as an advisor or simply show them that he understands their methods, it's likely to be the former, but in either case, it was never intended as a parody or sarcasm. 

I feel that this theory is propagated by people that appreciate the book, yet don't want to admit the validity of the advice in the book simply because it is ""immoral"".",1707725316,248,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1aov215/machiavellis_the_prince_is_not_sarcasm/"

"1ap1w4c","Is Goodreads a good source of books for newer readers? How should I approach it?","Let me just go ahead and say that I'm not looking for recommendations in this post. I'm just trying to discuss how the Goodreads ratings work.

So, recently I've been on a reading mood and I'm having some trouble finding how exactly to get good recommendations from Goodreads (which seems to be the ""best"" source for user based ratings).

Let me try to explain myself a bit: I watched quite a good deal of movies, and generally decide what to watch next based on IMDB and Letterboxd ratings. Now, of course that this isn't exact science since a 1-5 or 1-10 is always subjective, but generally, both these websites give a fairly precise rating at least for the artistic quality of a film. Examples: While you may not like a film like Godfather, Solyaris or 2001, the fact that they are highly rated is not only for the ""enjoyment factor"" but also because they present a lot of artistic qualities that are not easily found in other films. Of course, there are some low rated movies (on the low 5s) that are still quite good, but you have to dig through a lot of shit to get there.

Now, back to books, it seems that the examples I gave don't quite apply to Goodreads ratings. There are some 4.2+ books that are incredibly bland and it's kinda unbelievable that they're so high. I won't mention any specific case to not offend anyone, but it seems that if your book has the ""Young Adult"" and ""Fantasy"" tags combined, you're guaranteed a 4 at least. 

Then again, when you get some books regarded as classics, you usually see things in the low 3's which, for a new reader as myself, makes it all very confusing.

So, for me it's obvious that the system that I used to films doesn't seem to work for books, so, that brings me to two main questions:

1 - Why exactly does this happen in Goodreads? Is it something as a ""readers guilt"", where people feel they should give 5 stars to every book they read since they spent so much time doing it?

2 - Is there a similar website with a better system for literature?  Or should I just follow lists and similar stuff?",1707749914,111,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ap1w4c/is_goodreads_a_good_source_of_books_for_newer/"

"1ap84k5","Growing up, it seemed like Tom Clancy was everywhere. I can see why, but the books didn't age well.","In the 90's, you'd always see one of his books on shelves at the bookstore, grocery store, airport. And a new movie or show was always coming out, with his name attached. I was more into detective books for most of my life. But after watching the Jack Ryan TV series, I figured I'd try the books.

This is sort of a multi-book review, sorry, it's long.

For a first novel, The Hunt for Red October really was a banger. The inside of a sub is a weird, claustrophobic setting, and makes for some interesting built-in tension... You're in this huge, slow-moving whale of a ship, which can't reasonably dodge attacks, and if you get hit, everyone on board dies a horrifying death. The level of detail really sells it, you'd swear Tom Clancy spent half his life in a sub, but he was never in the military (except for going into the ROTC and being dq'd for eyesight). Before writing books, he sold insurance.

Clancy goes into the circumstances that might cause an embittered high-level submarine captain to defect, he talks about people's motivations and backgrounds quite a bit, so it's not all dry technical military stuff. The captain comes up with a clever plan to make his defection happen, which necessitates murdering the always-present political officer during a deployment, and duping the crew into thinking it was an accident. The plan nearly falls apart at the finish line, and we're introduced to lowly CIA analyst Jack Ryan, who comes up with his own plan to protect Captain Ramius, save the crew, and somehow acquire the sub. At the end, Ryan survives a shootout, and we establish that the hero has both brains and brawn.

So, I decide to continue the series, and for a while, it's pretty good.

Patriot Games puts Ryan into a more personal conflict with a branch of the IRA, shows how he came to be at the CIA, and establishes his credibility as an action hero. He's maybe a little too perfect, as protagonists go, but likeable. He's a former marine, which establishes him as a trained badass, but has a back injury that causes him to walks with a limp, which makes him seem little more humble and vulnerable. This somehow doesn't stop him from surviving gunfights, and later... the author writes away his crippling injury with a genius medical procedure. 

He's always portrayed as this honorable boy scout (literally) who just wants to do his duty and protect his family. Along the way, he gets to be a millionaire (thanks to a bit of technically-legal insider trading, and this is the closest he comes to having a flaw) So now the hero is rich, which is something I've seen a lot of authors do, to sort of handwave away a lot of the everyday life challenges that might keep the protagonist from going on adventures. 

The Cardinal of the Kremlin revisits the idea of protecting a Russian defector, or rather, a high-level bureaucrat who has been passing info to the CIA for years, and along the way, Ryan somehow forces the KGB chairman to come along. We get to see him less as an action hero, and more as a smart guy who has to work out the political angles. We spend a lot of time in Russia, which sort of puts him in the lion's den. The book is a bit of a slog, but I think Clancy's portrayal of Russia is one of his strengths, he seems comfortable with talking about the quirks of russian politics, and his characters are fleshed out.

Clear and Present Danger was, for me, a minor dud. The US president is in a tight race to get re-elected, and the public thinks he's ineffective at stopping drug trafficking, so he initiates a bunch of small, covert military actions in Columbia to wreck the drug kingpin's operations. It's probably illegal, despite the pretext that the drug trade is a 'clear and present danger' to national security, and it feels a bit like Clancy writing up a daydream fantasy of ""what if we just bombed these scumbags?"". There's a subplot where some hardened rapist smugglers are put through a mock execution and the Coast Guard captain who does this is sort of given a token finger wag for it. There is a somewhat interesting perspective from the generic kingpin's right-hand-man, a well-trained spy who seduces a secretary (we'll see that again later) and gets critical information, which is used to blow up the director of the FBI and the head of the DEA. The president counters by having the kingpin's mansion bombed during a meeting with other high-level baddies. Jack Ryan is basically just there to get outraged when the president decides to leave the small special forces group stranded in indian country, and helps extract them when the administration was prepared to write them off. 

I was left with the feeling that Clancy's understanding of South America just isn't really as nuanced as his portrayal of Russia, and the characters are more simplistic. The cartel kingpin is blustery, a sort of tinpot tyrant, his henchmen are just generic bad guys.

The Sum of All Fears is much better, and it's where the author starts to peak, but also kind of the beginning of the end for Jack Ryan. 

The plot is very slow-burn, detailing how some terrorists gain access to an unexploded nuclear bomb... it was loaded during a tense moment in the middle east, was supposed to be unloaded, but an over-eager pilot takes off with it and gets shot down, and the bomb is lost in some farmer's field, where it's rediscovered 20 years later. For most of the book, tension is built as the terrorists find allies and gain the technical resources needed to restore it to operation, and they decide to target the Super Bowl stadium in Denver. Ryan meanwhile, isn't clued into this for most of the book because he's dealing with a smear campaign from the white house foreign affairs advisor. If Jack wasn't heroic enough yet, he literally brings peace to the middle east. But the advisor, a careerist who's found her way into the president's bed, has a grudge because Jack was snippy to her once. So she robs him of credit. Then uses investigators to dig up dirt on him, which leads to whispers that he's cheating on his wife. These are false, of course, because Jack Ryan's a bit of a saint. 

How much of a saint? Ryan regularly visits a widow, because he watched her husband die during a military mission, and has vowed to put all 10(!) of his kids through college. He makes good on his promise. The good-guyness of Jack Ryan can, at times, be a bit overdone.

I like the book because the author isn't afraid to avoid the predictable ""good guys foil the plot at the last second"" ending, and without totally spoiling everything... the bomb does go off, and the terrorists are portrayed as very sharp, initiating some false-flag attacks with Russia to distract everyone from the real culprits and let their enemies destroy each other. But Jack figures this out, realizing that that the president is being manipulated by his mistress into a possible nuclear war. There's sort of a Cuban Missile Crisis moment, and he figures out a way to avert war despite his warnings falling on deaf ears... by directly contacting the Russian president and explaining the situation. 

President Fowler overreacts when he realizes the true source of the threat, and orders a rage-induced nuclear strike on the middle east, but Ryan again steps in and saves the day by making use of the two-man rule, which (if you're old enough) you may have seen before in WarGames. We see him deliver a thorough chiding, which is deserved, but makes the character start to feel less like a boy scout analyst and occasional action hero, and more like a moral authority whose crowning moments come down to him wagging his finger and really telling someone off. 

I skipped Without Remorse, which is an origin story for one of the recurring characters, a former SEAL and master spy named John Clark. 

Debt of Honor might be where the series starts to flag, but it has a killer ending. A flaw in the gas tanks of a few Japanese cars leads to a highly publicized accident leading to a handful of deaths. Politicians sieze on this to enact a new trade policy with Japan... the country is portrayed as being under the control of a handful of corrupt industrialists who have exploited an unequal trade policy for years to gain control in American markets. The new policy threatens these industrialists, who hatch a plot to retaliate, which is partially fueled by one man's personal hatred of America. 

This book feels like it has a more overtly political message, and is clearly an exension of the author's political beliefs. There's some token effort to explain Japanese culture and the mindset of the bad guys, but they're still very much the bad guys, portrayed as misguided and greedy, with somewhat less depth than the Russians tend to get in his earlier books. There was a minute, during the 90's, where Japan and its culture were this cool mysterious thing... we had movies like Rising Sun, which I think helped coax this book into existence. And maybe James Clavell's work was an influence?

One area that I like about the book is, they explore an interesting idea on what economic warfare might look like, and gets into cyberwarfare a bit, though there's also the obligatory military clashes. Japan seizes control of the Marianas, a US territory, and attacks some military assets, hiding behind the claim that it was an unfortunate accident, one that makes their seizure of the territory possible. Ryan figures out a neat, ""so simple it's brilliant"" way to save the economy, and advises the president in a way that results in a tidy, more-or-less proportional response that hurts the Japanese economy and a few of their own boats and aircraft, leading to surrender. Then, at the last minute, it all goes to shit, and I'll try to avoid a spoiler except to say that Clancy looks like he saw 9/11 coming back in 1994 early.

By the next book, Jack Ryan is president, and for me... President Ryan is a lot less interesting than humble CIA analyst Ryan. The bad guys this time are Muslim extremists, led by an ambitious Iranian leader who orchestrates the assasination of the Iraqi president, and successfully invades, ""uniting"" the countries. He then quietly has a team engineer a nasty bio-warfare weapon based on Ebola. Anyone who grew up in the 90's might again get that feeling that... these books are very much of their time. ""Outbreak"" (which features a similar disaster) comes out in 1995, and one year later, we have Executive Orders. 

The book does an excellent job of building up several subplots, disasters that put the weight of the world on the president's shoulders. Besides the disease, Jack has to rebuild a crippled government where a lot of the key positions are unfilled, and is taking constant heat in the press. The VP of the last president, was forced to resign for sexual assault, but now is trying to walk it back by orchestrating a technicality that would allow him to claim he's the real president. If Jack is able to survive this, he's still probably heading for doom... one of secret service team is a sleeper agent for the baddies. Meanwhile, there's a plan to kidnap his daughter from daycare. And finally, there's a (honestly unnecessary) subplot where domestic terrorists are trucking a load of fertilizer bombs to the white house. 

It's a pretty ambitious book that explores a lot of ""what-if"" scenarios, but it's somewhat less satisfying for me because the good guys just beat everything. Not effortlessly, at least, but... the kidnappers get outsmarted and blown away, the nutty militia guys get caught before they do any real harm, someone picks up on the sleeper agent's very small errors, the sneaky backdoor coup by the former vice president fizzles, and the damage from the outbreak is minimized by Jack Ryan simply having the national guard restrict travel and tell everyone to stay home and mask up. We can all have a good laugh about the plausibility of that, in retrospect. But it does also occur to me... to Clancy's credit, his far-fetched disaster senarios are actually not so far-fetched. 

It's a good read, just that it feels like the success of the evil plot feels much less ""oh wow, he went there"" than it did in Sum of All Fears. I can see why this book somehow wasn't movie material despite all sorts of dramatic potential. 

Rainbox Six is probably the most standard action-movie material in the books, getting away somewhat from politics and spy stuff and focusing on a bunch of guys who basically shoot guns real good. The focus is on Clark and Chavez, side characters from previous books who are running an elite counterterrorism unit. Coincidentally (or maybe not), this unit comes into existence around the same time as a spike in seemingly random terrorist events... events which are not-so-random, it turns out. The book has a fairly absurd plot where extreme environmentalists decide to end the world with a bioweapon, and it was kind of a weird call by Clancy to dive back into ""Super ebola"" when he just did that in the previous book. The bad guys are cartoonishly deluded and sociopathic, and the stakes absurdly high, and so some tension is removed because clearly Clancy isn't going to let the bad guys kill 7 billion people, unless he's transitioning from military fiction to The Walking Dead.

I decided to quit the books after The Bear and the Dragon... the pacing is lousy, the politics are SUPER heavy-handed, and the plot is too much of a rehash of previous material. It generally feels less plausible, and the bad guys more cartoonish than ever before. It's Debt of Honor in a scooby doo villain mask. 

Instead of Japan leveraging an uneven trade relationship, it's China. Instead of a small family being blown up by shoddy workmanship, leading to a US boycott... it's a papal ambassador getting blown up by Chinese cops, leading to a US boycott. Pissed off president enacts a new stricter trade policy, and the other country panics and retaliates... in this case, by trying to invade Russia and steal a wealth of recently-discovered natural resources. Once again, we have a secretary to a high-level politication getting seduced, leading to criticial info. Except she kind of just gigglingly says ""ok I'll install spyware on my PC for you"" because the CIA spy gives her good dick. It's a lot less nuanced than the seduction of the FBI director's assistant in Clear and Present Danger. The ministers simply decide to start a war with Russia (and, by extension, USA and NATO) and somehow the voice of reason gets shouted down. They bank on a military advantage, but the advantages gets wiped out by new space-age technology, and just like that... the war is over, the warmongers are deposed, the arrogant foreigners are put in their place. It's all very on-the-nose, and just kind of feels like ""USA smart and good, China dumb and bad"". There's a brief nuclear scare that feels contrived and has the kind of ""good guys always win at the last minute"" ending that Clancy avoided in earlier books.

---

tl;dr

So... Clancy's strengths: 

The books are always steeped in technical detail, which really adds to the realism. When he talks about life in a sub, you'd swear he spent months at sea. When he talks about how they repair and improve the yield of this nuke, you'd swear he spent the last ten years working on nuclear bombs. He sounds like he's done his homework on everything from the internal politics of the CIA, to the black markets that sprung up after the fall of Communism, to the technical challenges of shooting down a missile.

The dialogue is mostly solid, with the occasional contrived and theatrical monologue. Jack Ryan gets increasingly preachy in later books, and several characters jump on soapboxes. 

The books are very ambitious, trying to delve into exactly what it must feel like to be a fly on the wall when a president decides to launch nukes, or send troops somewhere, or fend of political attacks, or make a difficult and unpopular decision to handle a national crisis. Everything has this huge geopolitical scale, except maybe the 2nd book where it's a little more about Ryan and his family being directly targeted. 

But the thing that killed the books for me (and this gets worse and worse, over the years) is the politics. 

The plots are very much the product of Clancy's political views, and his upbringing during the cold war. At first, it's not too bad. I lean left, but I thought ""ok, this guy's conservative, but he seems sane. I could talk to this guy"". The Russians go from the bad guys, to frenemies, to simply friends, and I remember during the 90's that it was kind of hip for the younger generation to talk about supporting Russia, I guess rebelling against parents who ranted angrily about commies. You'd hear American throw around terms like glasnost and perestroika, something I remember even as a high-schooler with zero interest in politics. Tom Clancy's Russians seem fleshed out, not too stereotypical, with a variety of perspectives and motivations. 

His Columbians are cartoonish, desperate peasant workers, lazy and careless soldiers, and a kingpin who is straight out of every bad action movie. The Chinese are depicted as completely alien, with irrational and arrogant mindsets, several times Jack Ryan refers to them as ""Klingons"" because their thinking is just so impenetrable and foreign. And if any readers might be bothered by the terms ""Chinks"" or ""Japs"", well... you're gonna be seeing a lot of that. 

There's too many unnecessary detours into thinly veiled political rants. If you were wondering about Clancy's stance on abortion, gun control, the war on drugs, military spending, tax policy, foreign policy, or the environment... don't worry, he'll tell you. He'll contrive a scene where the wealthy good-guy former hedge fund manager talks tells you how those 'little slant-eyed fucks' are screwing America with their trade policies. He'll contrive a scene where someone wonders ""why would anyone want to kill a little baby?"". Someone will also tell you how ""this is the true damage wrought by communism"". Every environmentalist is a ""tree hugger"" and when he talks about women, sometimes it's like he's just paying lip service to them being smart and capable, like ""she's a great doctor, sure, but she always nags me about my cool smoking"". Or the antagonist in The Sum of All Fears, a careerist who sleeps with the boss to get ahead, and also the nutty environmentalist who helps plot the end of the world. 

It isn't so much that I'm surprised or appalled that someone in a political job would have conservative politics, or that a soldier would use the occasional politically incorrect slur. That's not unrealistic. It's just that throughout all the books, there's this sort of recurring theme where the good guys are... you know, all part of the rich white catholic old-boy network, the bad guys are all the boogeymen from the 80's, communist countries and muslims and Columbia (which kind of was on everyone's radar during the Just Say No era). Inexplicably Clancy does seem to love Saudi Arabia, portrayed as the most reasonable and friendly middle eastern ally.

To his credit, I think he sees himself as progressive, in some areas. Jack Ryan goes on TV to tell people ""don't hate all muslims, because of this on extremist"". His VP is black. He favors nuclear disarmament while simultaneously portraying USA as somewhat crippled by general miltary drawdown. It's just that... often, when you see a kind of cringy bit of casual racism or sexism, it's coming from someone who is unambiguously one of the good guys. 

There's a scene where, after stalled and contentious trade talks, one of the minor diplomats cuts loose from all the formal diplomatic language and rips into one of the Chinese advisors, telling him ""your dicks aren't big enough to get into pissing contest with us"". I thought the author was going for this as being some sort of catalyst for war, an ""oh shit we fucked up"" moment, instead I realized it's just a little wish fulfillment... ""what if we just told them what we REALLY thought"". Jack Ryan compliments him on the comment, later.

Try to imagine John Krasinski delivering this thought from the books, in 2024: ""How could he bring back the ethos of his parents' generation, and a world in which engaged people went to the altar as virgins? Now they were talking about telling kids that homosexual and lesbian sex was okay.""

For me, that stuff is a turnoff, and the politics just get increasingly 'bumper sticker' from book to book. So, I think this is a good place for me to get off the train, since the series is clearly on the decline and later gets taken over by other authors anyway.",1707765188,531,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ap84k5/growing_up_it_seemed_like_tom_clancy_was/"
"1apf2fh","Why are books that are considered ""literary"" so depressing?","I joined Quiz bowl this year, and I've been learning about books that are classics or are considered ""literary,"" and a lot of them sound interesting to me. I'm a fan of pretty language in books. I'm a fan of complex, well thought out metaphors, so a lot of these books I hear about sound intriguing to me.

I read the first chapter of Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison today. I went into the book blind with pretty much no expectations, and just in the first chapter we got a guy jumping off a building, and a different suicide attempt. We also got a woman who has a weird, icky relationship with her son as well as her Dad. And Macon who I think is the main character threatened to evict a single mother that was struggling to pay her rent and feed her children. When I saw the title I thought it was going to be a romance, and so far I've been severely disappointed.

The last book I read was Heart of Darkness, and I knew it was going to be kind of sad and gruesome because I had already watched Apocalypse Now, and I knew about the relationship between the two. One of my teachers had a copy of Heart of Darkness, and it's a really small book. I knew it was going to be sad and gruesome, but I thought it was short enough that it wouldn't be too bad. But its so hard to read it took me like three weeks, maybe, and it was just a really depressing book. Watching Apocalypse Now was a lot more bearable because HoD took me 10+ hours to read, while apocalypse now was only a two hour movie. It was the same subject matter but HoD was a more prolonged exposure to it.

Before that I read 100 years of solitude. I watched some youtube videos on it, and it sounded really interesting. I heard about the yellow butterflies and the roses falling from the sky and how it was multi generational story, and I kind of assumed it was going to be a story of love and loss. I thought it was going to be equal parts joy and equal parts sadness. When I actually went to read it, it gave me this really strong feeling of loneliness, which I probably should of known would happen from the title. I feel like there was only a few rare happy moments in the book, and the rest was just bad thing after bad thing, and I know that's what the author was intending, but reading it just made me sad.

Why do you guys think books that are considered to have academic value tend to be so sad. I'm too early into song of Solomon to really know what its central themes are. Heart of Darkness is supposed to be about the evil nature of the human race, so its depicting all the horrible acts of human kind. 100 years of solitude is supposed to be about the self destructive nature of the human race, so it depicts people making bad decision that lead to unfulfilling and solitary lives. Going in to other books I've read, Things Fall apart is about a culture was destroyed by colonialism. Frankenstein is about somebody who is shunned by society and who's creator hates them. Even children's classics like Old yeller and Charlette's Webb spend a whole book making you attached to one character and then killing them off. 

All these books have pretty dark subject matter that justifies how sad they are, but why do so many well respected books have such dark subject matter? Is there a reason why books with dark subject matter or more respected than books with lighter subject matter? Most of these book depict the negative aspects of human nature. Are there any great literary works that depict the positive aspects of human nature? 

One example I can think of is the little prince. I think it's really well written and uses well thought out metaphors, and has some insight on human nature. But it's insight isn't that human nature is inherently evil like in Heart of Darkness or that human nature is inherently self destructive like 100 years of solitude. The insight of the little prince is that our relationships are as valuable as the effort we put into them, which is insight that I feel like applies to my life more than anything Frankenstein or Heart of Darkness said.

It's not that books should never have dark or sad subject matter it's just that most of the books we put on classics list or that we study in school are these depressing ass books that talk about horrible everyone is. I honestly prefer a book to have sad moments as well as joyous moments, but a lot of these books are just pity parties. 

An argument I see a lot is that these books are so dark because ""thats how life really is."" I don't know about you guys, but I've never gone to colonize Africa, I've never fought in a war, I've never sailed the ocean trying to kill one really big fish, or most other tropes in classic literature. I also don't think humanity inherently evil. I just feel like a lot of what happens in classic literature isn't all that applicable to actual modern day people's lives.

Should I just stop reading literary fiction? Should I just start reading Fantasy, or sci fi, or young adult romance? Are there any great well respected books that aren't sad and gross? ",1707782107,489,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1apf2fh/why_are_books_that_are_considered_literary_so/"

"1aqhuga","TW: Sexual Assault talk - My rant to people who hate on books just for including sexual assault","For context, I am a 23 year old woman who was raped a few years ago after a man took me to his home while I was in an drunken unconscious state. I awoke just towards the end and immediately left and walked home, trying to comprehend if that had really just happened. It did and I have since recovered mentally and emotionally so please, your heartfelt sorry's, while appreciated, are not necessary :)  
So, I'm sick of people labelling books as bad only because it includes sexual assault in the narrative. Especially when said people go on a rant about why they think the book is bad because of it. They say how it doesn't describe the act of assault accurately to real life. They say it shouldn't be included at all because media is supposed to be escapism. They say it's overdone.  
Rape is different for every single victim. There are SO MANY variables and types. Some victims black out. Some are hyper aware. And some even orgasm. The only commonality to occur is, by the end, we are riddled with disgust. Hell, not even that. Some victims don't realize what it was until months later. But to say a book did a rape scene ""inaccurately"" because the woman didn't resist/did resist, didn't cry/did cry, did orgasm/didn't orgasm etc. drives me mad because it perpetuates the notion that rape is so black and white. It's not.  
The aftermath. This is another grey area that is constantly made out to be black and white. Not every victim has the same road to recovery. Some will, sadly, carry it for their whole lives. Some really do move on from it after a couple of months. And to echo that one comment from before, some might not even know it happened for a long time and as such don't start their recovery for a long time. Both me and someone I know were victims and we had different roads to recovery. I recovered a lot faster than she did. Yet, if my story were to be put into a book, it'd be labelled ""inaccurate"".

People say rape towards characters in a story needs to become a constant reflection on them to ""at least service their character"". Again, it is different for every victim. Some do remain skittish, such as refusing to ever be alone with a man again, whereas others are the opposite. Within a year of my assault, I was comfortable to go for a drive with a man at night, so long as he wasn't a total stranger (but I'd rarely do the same with a female stranger either). Something we women have to constantly shout from the rooftops is how common sexual assault and that most men would be shocked to learn the woman next to them is potentially among the 1 in 4. Yet so many people pretend that a female character in a novel must be physically, noticeably, effected to the point everyone can see what has happened. That is not the reality for many victims. I have met women, and even one man, who I knew for years. I wouldn't have ever thought they had been assaulted until they told me. They remained so unchanged that some of their own family didn't even know. Stop demanding for an ""accurate"" portrayal to look like a lone survivor soldier having just returned from WW2  
One complaint I can understand, though not fully agree with, is that too often female characters are raped and the trauma is passed onto the male lead. This is definitely done a lot BUT isn't an inherent problem in itself. To me, it sounds like we are denying men the acknowledgement of their emotions to something truly upsetting to learn about a person they love. Yes, I agree we need more of the female victims perspective but can we stop making it out that books, especially ones that are 50+ years old, are bad just because it showed the male leads story over the victims? 

That paragraph leads into this one. Why is murder, torture, war, genocide, child murders/deaths etc. rarely criticized as motivators for the protagonist (male or female) but rape is? All of them are horribly sad and evil things. Why should only one get a layer of cultural censorship? Especially seeing as rape is probably less commonly written about than most of those equally horrible things and when it is, it's in less detail.  
Escapism. If you consume media for escapism, then that is fair enough. But that's on YOU to pick out said escapist material. Storytelling media has been around since ancient times and has always dealt with horrible situations that plague human society. I don't think Homer wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey as escapism for his fellow Greeks to chill out to. He wrote them as direct reflections of the evil that came with war. Media today has the right to continue writing stories as direct reflections upon our society, which means writing about very dark topics. P.S. I am all for trigger warnings in the backs of books just as we put age ratings on the front of movie covers so people know what to look for/what they're getting into  
Lastly, I hate when people say that, despite all these reasons, it should still not be written about unless super sensitively and specifically (and only by women) because it may be traumatizing for victims to read. While this is true for some, it is not true for all. I, a victim, can enjoy books that feature it. Again, people, some of which probably aren't even victims themselves but trying to be white knights, are putting every victim into one tiny general box, which is almost as harmful in its ignorance as the men who deny rape cultures existence.

And one small side note. I do not even agree that it is overdone. Out all of the tragic backstories I see a character be given, rape is among the very few that I see depicted. Either I'm dodging bullets or people are just picking up trash books from indie published authors (no hate on them but they are more likely to be badly written). And for those I have come across, it was set in a time/place where I'd expect such a traumatic moment to be apart of the characters life. But that ties into me not reading books for escapism.   
So PLEASE, can we stop with painting this subject with such broad black and white strokes and admonishing writers for including it? The only criticism I see worth giving is if it happens to be glorified or made a joke of. And I have never once in my life of reading come across a book that did such a thing and if it ""did"" it was through the eyes of a first person psychotic narrator like in Clockwork Orange, which is as much a form of commentary as providing the same story in third person.   
Odds are, the book is not bad. It's just not for you. Put it down and move on. I don't like high fantasy so when I read a book that reveals a talking dragon lives in the cave to grant wishes, I don't review bomb it or hate on it online. I put it down cos I don't care for books with wish granting talking dragons. 

P.S. I am 100% all for books having trigger warnings to help the more sensitive people avoid books with upsetting material. I'd rather that then they waste their money on a book they won't want to read and proceed to review bomb it or hate on it in online forums",1707898062,262,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1aqhuga/tw_sexual_assault_talk_my_rant_to_people_who_hate/"

Here are some memorable character names from literature I found quite hard to pronounce but still very curious:   
Ignatius J. Reilly - From ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" by John Kennedy Toole. Ignatius is a unique character with a name that perfectly complements his quirky personality.  
Humbert Humbert - The protagonist and narrator of ""Lolita"" by Vladimir Nabokov. The repetition of his name adds a peculiar, almost comical, layer to his character.  
Zaphod Beeblebrox - From ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" series by Douglas Adams. His name is as outlandish as his personality and two-headed, three-armed appearance.  
Peregrin Took (Pippin) - From ""The Lord of the Rings"" by J.R.R. Tolkien. While not inherently funny, the name has a playful sound, fitting for the character's lighthearted nature.  
Horatio Hornblower - The protagonist of a series of novels by C.S. Forester. The alliteration and unusual surname lend a distinctive and somewhat whimsical air to this naval hero.  
Sue Bridehead - From ""Jude the Obscure"" by Thomas Hardy. Her name is peculiar and has a certain whimsy, contrasting with the novel's serious themes.  
Uriah Heep - From ""David Copperfield"" by Charles Dickens. Dickens was known for giving his characters names that reflected their personalities, and Uriah Heep's is no exception, hinting at his creepiness and sycophantic behavior.  
Titus Groan - The title character from ""Titus Groan,"" the first book of the ""Gormenghast"" series by Mervyn Peake. The name is both grand and slightly absurd, fitting the gothic and grotesque world he inhabits.  
Eustacia Vye - From ""The Return of the Native"" by Thomas Hardy. Her name is exotic and mysterious, mirroring her character's passionate and rebellious nature.  
Osgood Slugworth - Although more known from the film adaptations, Slugworth is mentioned in Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" as a rival chocolatier.

1. Why is reading books considered productive? Your grammar, speaking skills and writing skills might improve but is there something else to it?  
2. Why do so many successful people read books? Usually, they have a wall full of books. People that are successful are very busy and spend go lot of time refining their talents or skills. Why use some of that precious time reading books? I am aware that there is much more to life than doing all that but to that, I want to say they have so little time why not spend time with family, travel, play video games or watch movies, go out and have fun?

I honestly feel that in many cases you CAN judge a book by the cover, though obviously that’s not always the case. A lot of times friends or family will suggest a book to me, and i can immediately tell that i will hate it just by the cover art. I’m curious to know what other people’s cover turn offs are! 

Mine are like those cartoon romance covers where no one has a face and there’s cursive all over it, and then also just straight up photos of a model or random person meant to portray the main character. I also usually avoid covers that have a woman in sunglasses on them (besides My Sister the Serial Killer). Idk why.

However recently i realized how much i prefer to see straight up stock photos of abs on the cover of a book over the cartoonized ones, and i don’t even read romance. Its just nostalgic.",1708025660,248,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1arnyeg/judging_by_the_cover_whats_your_turn_off/"
"1arpi4q","Crytponomicon is a spectacular tale of adventure following a motley crew through the weirdest parts of WW2...shackled to an insufferably tedious search for gold with The Worst Guy You Know.","I am so mixed on this book at the moment.  I love all the stuff with Bobby and Waterhouse and Goto adventuring through WW2.  But then there's fucking **Randy**.  

Everything with Randy is such a steep drop in quality from the rest of the book, with weird 7-page digressions into proper cereal-eating technique--admittedly a hilarious prank to play on the reader--to Randy jerking off in a bathroom, to pillories of 1990s ""politically correct"" academic types. The ""Randy"" half of the book is pervaded by a technofetishistic adulation of Really Smart Tech Dudes with all the ""Maker"" and ""Taker"" subtext of an ayn rand novel. 

And it needs to be said, the book's relationship with women is...*really* not great. There's basically only one woman in the entire book who matters, an exotic half-Filipina  Not-Like-Other-Girls  deep-sea diver with a hatred of digital watches who just *happens* to fall madly in love with Randy...for some fucking reason. The other women in the book are exclusively objects for the protagonists to fuck, or obstacles that prevent the protagonists from fucking the objects.  i've read enough of Stephenson's work to know he's not actually a weird creepy incel *himself*, but I can definitely see why creepy incel weirdos say Cryptonomicon is  their favorite book. 

If there was an abridged copy of the book that just focused on the adventures of Bobby, Larry, and Goto through ww2 it'd be one of my favorite books of all time--and those parts are still good enough that the book as a whole is worth reading.  

But fuck Randy, man.",1708029431,180,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1arpi4q/crytponomicon_is_a_spectacular_tale_of_adventure/"
"1as424b","Stop reading self help books","Probably not a hot take here, but self help books are stupid. And yet, the only books I've seen fellow students, from my senior year of high school, to my freshman year of uni, in memory, read anything other than them. Atomic Habits, Rich Dad Poor Dad, ""The subtle art of not giving a fu\\*k"", even the ""good ones"" are bad. You're not going to learn anything from someone else vomiting what they've learned through life at you. The best you'll get out of it, is a rapid change in lifestyle based on someone elses experiences and observations, that they directly narrate to you with no context whatsoever. These authors also, throughout their reading, convince themselves so thoroughly of their rhetoric, and become so commited to the title they planned before they even thought of a single sentence, that they'll spare you any helpful nuance that experience actually imparts upon you, the things that actually matter, that don't make you an Andrew Tate, or a Jake Paul. I understand wanting the ""secret sauce"" or the ""it"" that ""they"" ""get"", but the only person self help books are helping, is the author. 

I never really understood the utility of self help books, when fiction books perfectly impart those same lessons, through a relatable and flawed character, where you can actually put yourself in someone elses shoes, and experience someone elses troubles, and come to the conclusions yourself, instead of hearing someone else say something that sounds like it makes sense at first, and connecting it to your own lacking experiences.l

I'm definitely overgeneralizing, and certainly some people have been ""helped"" by self help books, but I seriously think they're a waste of your time.",1708073422,826,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1as424b/stop_reading_self_help_books/"

I have a lot of people asking me for updates on the original post, but that post being so old now, very few people actually see the edits I make, so I wanted to make a new post to share the new developments on the case.

&#x200B;

Since my last post, Mark Dawson’s Self Publishing Formula put out a statement saying that it was rebranding to Learn Self Publishing and that Mark was “taking the rebrand as an opportunity to take a step back.”

Here’s what the old site looks like: [https://selfpublishingformula.com](https://selfpublishingformula.com)

And here’s what the new site looks like: [https://learn.selfpublishingformula.com/courses](https://learn.selfpublishingformula.com/courses)

His face and name are obviously now far less prominent.

Also, many of the links to his books on Hachette no longer work (in addition to being self-published on Amazon, he apparently also has a trad publishing deal with Welbeck which is owned by Hachette)

[https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/ghosts/9781787397651/](https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/ghosts/9781787397651/) and [https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/the-driver/9781787397057/](https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/the-driver/9781787397057/) and [https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/the-house-in-the-woods/9781802795837/](https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/the-house-in-the-woods/9781802795837/) and [https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/the-red-room/9781802795882/](https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/the-red-room/9781802795882/) all seem to bring up a page that says ""Oops! That Page Can't Be Found.""

However, [https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/saint-death/9781787394780/](https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/mark-dawson-2/saint-death/9781787394780/) is still available, despite Saint Death having a lot of evident plagiarism within.

On top of that, Mark still has a new book Bloodlands coming out on May 1, 2024, and I do fear that many of his readers haven’t been reached by the post and will still preorder it without knowing about any of his infractions. He’s done a great job at keeping quiet to try to avoid any serious fallout from his actions.

If you were still unsure if he was a plagiarist or not, here are some excerpts that you can still see in his novels on Kindle right now:

* \\[2013 William Boyd interviews James Bond by William Boyd from the Guardian\\] I looked at the bookcases, vaguely surprised to see so many books, always a clue to a personality. They were an odd mixture: books on bridge and golf; many novels by Eric Ambler; Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter. Some books on heraldry and The Collected Poems of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Most unusual. I pulled it out to look at the cover. Several pages had their corners turned down. I slipped it back into its slot on the shelf.
* \\[The Driver by Mark Dawson, Location 1065 of 4018\\] Milton looked at the bookcase, vaguely surprised to see so many books, always a clue to a personality. They were an odd mixture: books on astrology and make-up, novels by Suzanne Collins and Stephanie Meyer. Some books on fashion. The Collected Poems of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Milton pulled it out to look at the cover. Several pages had their corners turned down. Not what he would have expected to find. He slipped it back into its slot on the shelf.

&#x200B;

* \\[2013 William Boyd interviews James Bond by William Boyd from the Guardian\\] Lightly tanned, he was slim, about my height, six feet one inch, and had short dark hair with no trace of grey. I knew people would ask me to describe him with more precision. There was a scar on his right cheek. He was even-featured – though there was something ""hard"" about his looks. \\[…\\] He could look almost swarthy in certain lights and had a clean, sharply defined jawline.
* \\[91% of Kindle sample The Driver by Mark Dawson (Location 441 of 4018)\\] He had short dark hair with a little grey. There was a scar on his face, running horizontally from his ear lobe, across his cheek, and terminating just below his right nostril. He was even-featured although there was something ‘hard’ about his looks. He looked almost swarthy in certain lights and, now that he had shaved away the untidy beard that he had sported while he travelled north through South America, his clean, square, sharply defined jaw line was exposed.

&#x200B;

He did change this next one from “peanut breath” to “you taste of venison” though, so there’s that.

* \\[Out of Sight by Elmore Leonard\\] He said because it would be worth the risk. She said, “You like taking risks,” touching his face with her hand, then kissed him, very gently, and said, “So do I, peanut breath.” He felt her fingers brush through his hair as she kissed him again, still gently, and it was hard—aware of her scent, remembering it—it was hard to keep from eating her up. He put his arms around her, feeling her slim body in his hands, and she brushed his mouth with hers, saying, “What’s the hurry, Jack? You have to be somewhere?”
* \\[Current version of The Sword of God, at Location 1868 of 5748 in Kindle\\] She said, “I don’t believe you,” touching his cheek with her fingers, then kissed him, and said, laughing, “You taste of venison.” She reached around to the back of his head as she kissed him again, a little more firmly, and he had to tell himself to wait. Her lips tasted sweet and her small, slim body felt good against him. He put his arms around her, drawing her even closer, feeling her body in his hands, and she touched his lips with hers. “What’s the big secret, John? What happened to you?”

&#x200B;

This one’s also a little close for comfort, though he did change “seeing her close from behind as they climbed the grade” to “watching her from behind as they were climbing the ridge,” so credit where credit is due.

* \\[Out of Sight by Elmore Leonard\\] Last night and all day today Foley kept seeing her in different ways: in the headlights before putting her in the trunk, her face up close, when she came out of the trunk showing her legs and when she stood there in the road, her body in profile, her nice tight rear end in that short skirt; and seeing her close from behind as they climbed the grade. Those pictures of her kept popping into his head and he would take his time looking at them. He never thought of her in a sexual way, like picturing her naked or wondering what her bush looked like. He would remember the feel of her, though, his hand on her arm, on her thigh with her skirt pushed up. He could hear her voice, too, saying, “Why, are you famous?” Saying, “Are you kidding?” And coming out of the trunk, “You win, Jack.” That was his favorite. “You win, Jack.” He played that one over and over.
* \\[The Sword of God (Location 1655 of 5748)\\] He kept seeing her in different ways: lying in the tent last night, the firelight dancing in her eyes; her face up close, the freckles that you couldn’t see unless you were really looking hard; the way she eyeballed him when he hauled himself out of the lake; the way her chest filled her shirt when she worked the straps of her pack over her shoulders; and watching her from behind as they were climbing the ridge. Those images kept popping into his head, one after another, distracting him, when he needed to keep his focus clear. He dismissed them, but then he would remember the way that her hand had felt in his, the warmth of her body as he had reached down to drag her up the slippery scree. He heard her voice, too, the confident tone, the attitude that almost dared him to argue with her. The way she had said, “I’m staying right here,” as he prepared the camp for the night yesterday, the way she’d said it and the way she’d looked at him, making him think that she was inviting him to take her to his tent. He heard that again and again and wondered what would have happened if he had made a pass at her.

&#x200B;

This one is LONG, but here are the bullet points to look out for first:

* “They went to the floor.” versus “Milton stumbled backwards, and they went to the floor.”
* “The deputy was trying to get his hands inside the chain but he could not.” versus “The man was trying to get his hands inside Milton’s arm, but he could not.”
* “He was gurgling and bleeding from the mouth. He was strangling on his own blood.” versus “He was gurgling, a line of blood trickling from his mouth. He was choking on his own blood.”

&#x200B;

* \\[NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN Page 5\\] He dropped his cuffed hands over the deputy’s head and leaped into the air and slammed both knees against the back of the deputy’s neck and hauled back on the chain. They went to the floor. The deputy was trying to get his hands inside the chain but he could not. Chigurh lay there pulling back on the bracelets with his knees between his arms and his face averted. The deputy was flailing wildly and he’d begun to walk sideways over the floor in a circle, kicking over the wastebasket, kicking the chair across the room. He kicked shut the door and he wrapped the throwrug in a wad about them. He was gurgling and bleeding from the mouth. He was strangling on his own blood. Chigurh only hauled the harder. The nickelplated cuffs bit to the bone. The deputy’s right carotid artery burst and a jet of blood shot across the room and hit the wall and ran down it. The deputy’s legs slowed and then stopped. He lay jerking. Then he stopped moving altogether. Chigurh lay breathing quietly, holding him. When he got up he took the keys from the deputy’s belt and released himself and put the deputy’s revolver in the waistband of his trousers and went into the bathroom. He ran cold water over his wrists until they stopped bleeding and he tore strips from a handtowel with his teeth and wrapped his wrists and went back into the office. He sat on the desk and fastened the toweling with tape from a dispenser, studying the dead man gaping up from the floor. When he was done he got the deputy’s wallet out of his pocket and took the money and put it in the pocket of his shirt and dropped the wallet to the floor. Then he picked up his airtank and the stungun and walked out the door and got into the deputy’s car and started the engine and backed around and pulled out and headed up the road.
* \\[Saint Death by Mark Dawson, Current Kindle version (Location 1617 of 3396)\\] Milton snaked his right arm around the man’s throat and started to squeeze. The man struggled, got his legs up, and kicked off the wall. Milton stumbled backwards, and they went to the floor. The man was trying to get his hands inside Milton’s arm, but he could not. Milton squeezed, the man’s throat constricted in the nook of his arm. He braced his left arm vertically against the right, his right hand clasped around his left bicep, and he pulled back with that, too, tightening his grip all the time, his face turned away. The man was panicking, his arms windmilling, legs kicking out, treading dusty prints up the kitchen cupboards. His sneakers squeaked agains the linoleum floor. He was gurgling, a line of blood tricking from his mouth. He was choking on his own blood. Milton squeezed harder. The man stopped struggling. Milton relaxed his grip. Milton got up and flexed his aching arm. He poured himself a glass of water and drank it, looking down at the dead man on the floor. Early twenties, a cruel face, even in death. His eyes bulged, and his tongue lolled out of blue-tinged lips. Milton crouched down next to the body, frisking it quickly: a mobile phone, a wallet with three hundred dollars, a small transparent bag of cocaine. Milton took the money and the phone, discarding the wallet and the cocaine, and then took a dishcloth and a bottle of disinfectant he found under the sink and cleaned down anything that he might have touched. He wiped the glass and put it back in the cupboard. He wiped the tap. He wiped the hob.

These examples were the ones I felt were the most blatant, and that only come from currently available works. He’s already edited most of his books, which used to have far more plagiarism in them than they do now (but he edited most of these before I called him out on it, so I don’t know when the edits were made).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before I go any further, I want to make some corrections to my previous post:

* Mark Dawson did not write 20 books in 2 years.
* Mark Dawson does not run 20BooksTo50K. Michael Anderle started it, and Craig Martelle runs it. Mark Dawson has talked at their Vegas conference as a guest speaker, but that seems to be the extent of his involvement.

I already edited the original post to clear up this misinformation, but I believe a lot of people probably saw the post before those edits were made, so I wanted to clarify again in this post from the very beginning.

When I made my first post, I was excited to get the news out, and wanted to quickly craft a reason why people should be interested. “Random guy plagiarizes” isn’t very tantalizing, after all. However, my research was shoddy and, as I didn’t know anything about this guy before I discovered the plagiarism stuff, I spread a lot of misinformation about him. I don’t think I’m wrong about the plagiarism, but I was wrong about that, and I would like to apologize. I take full accountability for getting it wrong, and I understand if you're disappointed or don't trust me anymore.

There are plenty of self-published authors who write very quickly and don’t plagiarize. I apologize to any who I inadvertently offended by insinuating that such work was either stolen or of poor quality. My intention was to advocate for the respect of self-published authors by getting rid of bad apples who might give them a bad name, not to degrade them or their work in any way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here are the other examples, and some of the examples from above with but with further context (I’ve included excerpts from the original versions of the books as well as the updated versions. A lot of these examples are less strong, but I think they’re worth looking at anyways. The idea is that he took a few really big scenes, but also a great number of small scenes as well which on their own wouldn’t mean much but taken as a whole indicate plagiarism of the work as a whole.)

A big thanks to u/RunDNA for suggesting that site in the comments.

My research was limited to the books he had added to his Goodreads account. I couldn't cross-search across every book I ever made, but someone pointed out to me that a lot of the books he plagiarized from were books he had reviewed on his Goodreads account, so I was able to set up an algorithm that compared all those texts against all of his texts in order to find the above examples. There was a lot of sifting through generic phrases, but I think I was able to find excerpts which are pretty indicative of plagiarism when taken as a whole. It's possible that he's plagiarized from many more sources, but unfortunately it'd be very inefficient trying to find those sources as I'd have to read all of his books, look for any phrases that seem out of place, look those up into Google, then compare the whole text against whatever text shows up to see if it was just a fluke or not, etc.

I'm also in talks with a writer from the Salisbury Journal, Mark Dawson's local paper, to get the story published, so hopefully that goes through.

Why on earth wouldn't I try to read all of them? 

In fact I would go as far as to say that there are so many classic books that are available (including modern classics too)  that I could spend a lifetime reading them. I don't really see the downside to this. 

It's commonly accepted that these books are excellent and worthy of praise and adored worldwide, they are classics because they contain thrilling plots, unbeaten structure and great and relatable characters. 

I have nothing against those who want to read the next best thing of course, I understand the position of those (like my mum) who prefer those light crime thrillers and such. 

But when I talk about how I just read crime and punishment, or animal farm, or pride and prejudice I get this sort of sense from avid readers that they are at least internally rolling their eyes at me, like I have committed this sin of reading common books.

Extemely mild, almost irrelevant spoiler ahead for the Atlas Complex by Olivie Blake

I think we’ve all encountered a time where it’s clear that you know more about something than the author does. Normally for me this is something about neuroscience, but I didn’t expect it this time to simply be a city in my country? Because I don’t think Olivie Blake knows what The Hague is…

In the book, an extremely minor event takes place at the International Criminal Court, which is located in the city of the Hague in the Netherlands. However, most people might be more familiar with the term ‘to be tried at The Hague’. And I think maybe people think that the ‘Hague’ is the institute or even just building instead of the, you know, city it’s in. 

So this book uses the two following phrases: ‘in the crowd outside the Hague’ and ‘What happened at the Hague’. Now, I am no native speaker, but replace those with Paris and the sentences sound extremely wrong. The Hague is very much treated like a non-city noun in these phrases. 

It was only these two sentences, it wasn’t relevant to the plot, yet it infuriated me enough to come here and talk about it. Because how did no one spot this? Not one editor or beta reader? So simple yet so frustrating

And now, to turn this into a group experience: what have you encountered in a book that you knew to be so extremely wrong that it needlessly frustrated you to the point of having to put the book down for a bit?

"1aujrw0","The excessive tropification of romance is very annoying","I don't usually pick up books of the romance genre, but since it's so common as a subgenre in other books, I feel like I can speak to it. I'm writing this after finishing Paradoxem; it's a science fiction that has a huge romantic subplot, and that romance was very, well, BookTok-like. The writing itself was very good overall, but all the romance scenes felt reaaally samey and I find this to be true for nearly all romances nowadays. The girl is smart and stubborn, the guy is hot and annoyingly flirtatitous, and you can probably write the book in your head without me saying anything else. There's one scene when the characters have to sleep inside a spacecraft hidden in a lab and, you guessed it, ""there's only one bed!"". Most of their interactions are based on him throwing witty flirtatitous jokes at her and her getting annoyed/blushing. He says the word ""fuck"" a lot. They think about each other's bodies constantly in a very ""I hate that he's so hot"" style. You get the idea.

I don't know, it feels like the same book and the same writing style over and over again. The same way you can almost always tell when a book started as fanfiction, you can tell when it was written after a hefty diet of TikTok and Instagram. These kinds of books feel like they were written around very specific indulgent scenes and lines (e.g ""only one bed"" or ""who hurt you"" tropes) with very little effort to develop the characters or their relationship beyond that. Feels like connective tissue with no vital organs.

To me, this whole thing is a repeat scenario of the romantic comedies of the 90's and 00's, but for books - everything has the same plot, the same characters and the same ending. I guess it's fine if you just want to appeal to that niche of BookTok and Bookstagram readers, but it feels so uncreative. It definitely doesn't work for people outside of that niche.",1708336782,207,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1aujrw0/the_excessive_tropification_of_romance_is_very/"

I’ve read hundred of books since then, but the nostalgia of these books for some reason just hit me in a way that no others series has ever been able to come close to.

Because of the new Percy Jackson show, I decided to pick up the books for a reread. I do want to add that this is my first time reading the books as an adult, and by no means would i say that I dislike the series now, but all of a sudden so many flaws that were once left unnoticed feel so visible to me now. 

I think a huge part of it is that I used to put the author on a pedestal, and so a lot of problems I may have noticed felt easy to disregard because I trusted his “vision”, but after the release of the new show, I can no longer say I feel the same way.

Also, before people jump at me for criticizing, a children’s book, just because content is aimed at children does not put it above criticism. I’m obviously not judging it by the same standards I would an adult novel, but there multiple plot inconsistencies, poor chatacterizations and underwhelming endings that I can’t say I love.

I still love the series, it will always be a huge part of my identity (I literally have multiple tattoos commemorating it on my body), but I do have a different perspective on the books now. I was curious to know if this is a shared experience for anyone else.

"1avnzfm","I’m reading Lolita and I’m confused","Hello all, 
I’ve decided to read Lolita due to morbid curiosity. I’m about half way through and I have some thoughts and want to discuss them. 

My biggest thought and something that is confusing me, is how come in the discussions I’ve seen some people say Humbert Humbert comes off as charismatic or charming? It’s made clear from the foreword that he’s insane, and then from Humbert’s own admission that he’s a pedophile. How do people not see that he’s trying to trick the reader? I understand that he’s speaking eloquently with beautiful prose, but he’s coming off as a condescending narcissist who likes to sprinkle in his French to sound/feel superior to the reader. 

I’ve also noticed that at a lot of times when Dolores she doesn’t sound like a child, it’s clearly an adult writing what they think a child might say; I don’t know if that’s intentional on Nabokov’s part or not, though I assume it is intentional because it gives me further reason to distrust Humbert. 

Overall I think it’s been an interesting read so far, my one complaint is that I don’t feel good reading it. It feels disturbing and gross; I feel bad for Dolores, especially with her fate being spelled out in the foreword.",1708451633,427,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1avnzfm/im_reading_lolita_and_im_confused/"

Quick post because I went on TikTok to see people talking about how good ACOTAR was and I can't stand it (shoot me if you think I am horrible for this).

I forced myself to read the first book. Did not even TOUCH the second book. ('m just joking I read a chapter or two then literally flung it away). 

Like the best way to describe it was: it felt like the world had been built around the characters rather then the characters being built INTO the world. (idk if this makes sense).

When I was reading it in my head there were like 10 people in this whole faeirie (??? idk the spelling tbh) kingdom. Everyone other then the two men fairie and the maid (who somehow was the most developed character) were evil. There is so much I could say about this book (nothing good don't worry I haven't lost my mind yet)

  
I have been reading since I first learnt English. My first every memory of coming to this country was going to the library. Me and my brother would get 16 books (which was the max) EACH and finish them in 2 weeks. I was top reader in my school for years. *What I am trying to say is I'm the type of person who has read ALOT and also reads EVERYTHING*. I can read literal kid novels to classic literature. 

  
NOTHING I have ever read has made my blood boil as much as ACOTAR has. Like I have read online books with SHITTY GRAMMAR and spelling mistakes so bad you question the persons credibility yet they have been better then whatever this mess was.

  
 I am so sorry 😭

  
 I think the part that pissed me off was that people were hyping it up.

Nowhere near Fosse's best, and far from the most interesting attempt at death in the first person that I've read. Not a bad read by any stretch, but there's just very little to it.

"1axz5jd","Romance fans: Do you like the miscommunication trope? Why or why not?","I should first start this post by saying what I mean by ""miscommunication trope"". What I mean is a plot point where two characters misunderstand each other and the conflict is dragged out because they won't talk to each other.

Examples: Jane finds a note from her love interest that says he likes Sarah's hair, and she takes it to mean he's having an affair with Sarah. Jane does not talk to love interest and instead breaks it off without telling love interest why. Later, Jane finds out ""Sarah"" is a new Muppet because love interest works at Henson studios and is designing the puppet, and it was all a misunderstanding all along!

Example 2: Tammy overhears the obvious villain who has been horrible to Tammy the whole book say that love interest is not in love with her, and is instead in love with the villain. Tammy believes obvious villain unquestionably and breaks it off with love interest without talking to love interest first. It turns out, Villain was lying! WHAT A SHOCKING TWIST.

So, me and other readers in my book club who are fans of romance absolutely despise this trope, but it so prolific in the genre. 

I know it's realistic. I know miscommunication is a massive problem in real life. However, it is not fun to read about. 

Usually when conflicts arrive, it's fun because you are trying to figure out how the characters are going to overcome their struggles. How is Uncle Tim going to save the family candy shop? What are our characters going to do?

But the miscommunication trope isn't fun because we already know how the conflict will resolve -- Just talk to each other. C'mon, just freaking talk to each other!

But it's so ubiquitous in the genre, that there *must* be people who enjoy the trope.

Do you like this particular trope? Am I being unfair to it? Do you think this trope is necessary to the genre?",1708690866,349,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1axz5jd/romance_fans_do_you_like_the_miscommunication/"

"1aydbif","Why is there such little interest in Hard-Science Fiction today when it was arguably the most popular sci-fi genre of the mid 20th century?","Hi there,

So I'm riffing off an [interview](https://youtu.be/aA6OxzQ3ON8) I just watched today with Baen Books regular author [Charles Gannon](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Charles-E-Gannon/77867934) talking about the lack of interest in Hollywood and television generally in the topic of science fiction generally, but more specifically: hard sci fi.

It's an interesting discussion if you have time for it. Charles talks about his career working as a script doctor for tv and film, particularly for companies interested in documentaries, his example being the discovery channel and listening to pitches for realistic science fiction programs. He makes the comment that executives and producers generally were uninterested in the genre and that it is seen as being too intellectual or high brow for modern general audiences. Yet as he points out, the Expanse did very well, earning itself 7 seasons and I think I can speak for most here, we would like more please.

So if he is correct, and you hardly ever see hard science fiction in film or tv these days (Ad Astra is another great example) why is that? From the 1930s even til the 1970s hard science fiction was considered the most serious and arguably popular version of science fiction. I think of the all the [radio dramas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_7z1I6D_dc) about how mankind might deal with the harsh realities of space travel or what it would take and be like to get to the moon.

Is it because we met some of our sci-fi dreams? Is it that we are really too stupid to appreciate this type of fiction anymore? Or does Hollywood like Charles says here, not understand a genuine organic appreciation for thoughtful high quality science fiction.

His work also describes the hubris of the aristocracy that was dying out while he wrote about the period with criticism and nostalgia.

However, 100 pages or so in, Swann's way, the first volume, just like its opening paragraph, took that 'peculiar turn' of absorbing me into the writing. I didn't care who the characters were and what they said. I began to feel as if Proust was perpetually administering microdoses of a drug that pulled me into a blank space in which only his gorgeous prose could be experienced. Every sentence, though maximilist, felt soft and transporting.

"1azpzuw","I have yet to read an epilogue, am I missing something? ","Tl;dr: I recently resumed reading for enjoyment after a decade, but have been skipping epilogues in books, thinking they’re just teasers. A friend suggested it’s like not reading prologues and claimed the epilogue is crucial for the story’s conclusion. I am wondering what I might be missing in the epilogues? 

I got back into reading for enjoyment (i.e.: not for school purposes) in 2022 after taking the better part of a decade off from reading. Since I’ve picked reading back up, i have yet to read the epilogue’s of any of the books I’ve read lately (Shadow of the Gods, Mistborn, The Way of Kings are some examples). 

I honestly never thought it was a big deal because I always felt like the book ended in a way that made sense, and I thought the epilogue was a teaser that was included to get you excited to read the next book. Not that it had an impact on the actual story. 

Fast forward to last night me and a couple buddies were chatting about the recent “I don’t read prologues” that has come up on social media lately. During this conversation one of my buddies said “yea not reading the prologue, is like not reading the epilogue”. To which I said that I always read the prologues but have yet to read the epilogues. This blew his mind, and he said I’m missing the literal ending of the books. But again I never felt like I was missing something.

"1b08mi2","I read Naked Lunch today.","Why did I do that?

This was one of the strangest things I've ever endured. This thing was more sexually explicit than a PornHub comment written by a raging nihilist hallucinating on every substance known to humankind (and possibly alienkind, too). Everything fucked everything else, and sometimes killed that something else and kept fucking it.

The drugs and violence in the book didn't bother me at all, excepting the sexual violence which was frequent to the literal point of insanity.

Naked Lunch is genuinely a chaotic mess--but I'm pretty sure that was intentional. It's an absurdist piece, so a nonsensicality is kind of necessary. Further, I think it's supposed to be a portrait of what it is like to be helplessly addicted, and how it destroys you (I'm just guessing, here; I haven't had much time to stop and think about it before spilling my thoughts here). 

 Over all, I don't think I liked it. But, then again, I don't even have a proper frame of reference to hold it to. The closest thing I can think of is perhaps the works of Tony Burgess (The Hellmouths of Bewdley, The N-Body Problem).

I hunted down the book because I saw Chroninberg's movie. Even if I didn't like the book, it was well worth reading once. I'm glad I will never have to do that again.

"1b0bgrp","The Twilight series is poorly written but  I have to defend this plot point","The writing is mostly garbage(I still like some of the world building) and problematic. I haven’t read the series in full since high school. This isn’t even in defense of twilight but it makes complete sense that the Edward and his “siblings” were high school. It is one of the few logical points in the story that are clearly explained in both the books and films. The Cullens “kids” are not perpetually in high school. In fact, they rarely do high school at all. However, when they settle into a small town(where they are much more conspicuous than a major city), they must use a back story that will allow them to stay in the town for as long as possible without people noticing they aren’t aging. This is done by beginning in their new home as high school sophomores(Edward and Alice) and juniors(Jasper, Emmet, and Rosalie). They graduate, go to college, & go to graduate school. By the time they reach their mid to late 20s without leaving, the towns people start to take notice and they leave. If they start at an older age, the fact they look like teenagers will be noticed in a shorter period time(this issue is unclear in the movies because they all look 30).

They had lived in Forks 70 or so years before, liked it, and wanted their second stay to last a long time. They had just moved there the year before Bella so still in the early phase of a planned 10-15 year stay in Forks. That’s why they were still in high school. 

No idea what kind of new batshit backstories they’d have to make for themselves after adding Bella and the demon baby to their number.


Side note, so many problematic aspects about Twilight are discussed but is no one disturbed Stephanie Meyer’s dream man(the book was literally born out a dream she had of him) is a 17 year old boy?

"1b15n25","Stephen Kings books are good and entertaining. But couldn’t bear to read another one due to the comments on God and religion.","This is my second post on Reddit…

When I began to read books consistently on a daily basis (in sixth grade), I was always fascinated by Stephen King. Everybody talked about how he is amazing at horror. In 8th grade I finally picked up my first Stephen King novel: Misery. It was an excellent read and Annie was so scary and had so much power for someone who doesn’t have any supernatural abilities. 

Where the comments started: I read Dreamcatchers next (underrated), and a got very confused when I read through a few parts of Stephen King adding rude commentary on God and Christianity. Although it was very little so I didn’t think about it after. But it kind of went on in The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, I still didn’t really pay much attention.

Then I got to The Tommyknockers…

The beginning sentences of the book felt like King was trying to through shade at Catholics. And a lot in the book King goes rambling along about how God isn’t a very good being. Heck, theirs even a chapter where “Jesus” helps a woman make a device to kill her husband. But a lot of this over the top stuff probably is due to him snorting “powder” a lot in that time of his life.

But I just could not finish. The book itself I feel was kind of a mess. I put it away for a few weeks and then threw it away. 

For some reason he doesn’t do this for a lot of his books.

But these are his beliefs and it is his book, so he can technically write whatever he wants in it.

Do people generally appreciate this like I do or does it ruin the book?",1709155297,145,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1b2hucc/how_do_you_feel_about_handwritten_messages_in/"
"1b2i3v9","Are 'GoodReads' book reviews accurate?","For about two or so years I've been using GoodReads to *help* judge whether or not a book is worth reading. Usually per my experience, the reviews have been mostly accurate (taken in with a grain of salt, of course).

However, some of the books I've read recently (in the last few months) with mild to bad reviews haven't actually been that bad. It's gotten to the point I've been questioning the accuracy of the reviewers and wondering if these books got review bombed or if we even read the same book.

I know it comes down to personal preference and reading skill but I thought I'd ask anyway.

Thanks for your time! :)",1709155904,243,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1b2i3v9/are_goodreads_book_reviews_accurate/"
"1b2jxf7","What books on your Goodreads ""read"" list have the highest and lowest average rating? Why do/don't you agree with those ratings?","My highest average rating is The Last Olympian by Rick Riordan with 4.55 stars. I gave it 5 stars. 

My lowest avg rating is The Secret Talker by Geling Yan with 3.08 stars and I rated it 2 stars. 

I definitely think The Last Olympian is inflated. While it is my second favorite out of the series, I felt it was incredibly slow to get started compared to the other four books. But being such a huge fan of the series since I was a kid, of course I gave it 5 stars and so did everyone else. 

I think the 3.08 stars for The Secret Talker is too generous but about what I would expect. It was a romance disguised as a thriller and the ending made me roll my eyes. The character lacked agency and is described as a ""military intelligence officer in training"" in the blurb, yet we never actually saw her perform that role. 

Curious to see what other people will contribute. ",1709160197,120,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1b2jxf7/what_books_on_your_goodreads_read_list_have_the/"
"1b2k3lu","What do you do with books you didn’t enjoy?","Like everyone, I have books I didn’t enjoy for a variety of reasons. Annoying characters, lack of plot, etc. I like having a really well curated bookshelf, and I don’t love the idea of keeping books I didn’t love.

I’ve turned to selling most of them on Pango, and I’ve been relatively successful. However there are a few ones that I can’t seem to sell (one of which is They Both Die at the End lol). I’ve been thinking about what to do with said books, and I was wondering:

What do yall do with books you read but didn’t enjoy? Do you keep them? Do you sell or donate them, and if you donate, what’s a good place to do it?",1709160604,325,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1b2k3lu/what_do_you_do_with_books_you_didnt_enjoy/"
"1b2ui5l","What types of books do you avoid? Conversely, what hated tropes do you not really care about?","For me, I avoid historical and literary fiction that focuses on multiple generations in a family. I really don’t give a shit about familial drama or who’s fucking who, which these stories tend to shallowly focus on. If I wanted to see family members at each others’ throats, I’d visit my dad’s side more. Also, I think these stories are just overdone. 

However, I see a lot of people bothered by books with a ton of POV characters. This doesn’t really bother me because I don’t get easily attached to characters, and sometimes, stories can benefit from getting the bigger picture. Another cliche topic people seem to dislike on this sub are WWII stories, but I don’t really mind them since I’m a huge enthusiast of military history.",1709191258,412,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1b2ui5l/what_types_of_books_do_you_avoid_conversely_what/"
"1b2zdcz","The Most Challenging Book You've Ever Read","Ever picked up a book that was tough to get through? Maybe it was super long, really complex, or just hit you hard emotionally. I'm curious to hear about the most challenging books you've ever read and why they were so tough for you.

For me, it was 'War and Peace' by Leo Tolstoy. It's not just the size, although it's certainly a long read, but also the vast number of characters and the depth of the historical and philosophical discussions that made it a challenge. It took me a while to keep track of everyone and fully grasp the themes Tolstoy was exploring.",1709210378,1771,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1b2zdcz/the_most_challenging_book_youve_ever_read/"

"1b33cnz","100 books to read before you die! (Modern books)","I found a few lists and I have started to tackle a “100 books to read before you die” list that seems good and I am planning on reading the titles over the next few years (I just finished book #8 Brave New World). A lot of them are classic literature and the most recent books are 50+ years old. I’m guessing older books are going to dominate lists like this since more people have heard of them and had time to read them. 

So my questions is, are there book titles that have come out in recent years (in the last 10-20 years) that belong on a list like this?

All these fae based books have a protagonist who has brown hair who has no powers, falls in love with the night/emo/dude in black and the big twist at the end of the book is the girl is more powerful than anyone else in the book.

"1b3btyi","Is pedophilia a common theme in Gabriel Garcia Marquez books?","I've read about three of his books now and thinking back, all three of them have an adult man having a full-fledged sexual relationship with a young girl.

Love in the time of cholera, one hundred years of solitude, and of love and other demons.

Each time it's a main character, not a side character and in one hundred years of solitude, I kind of waved it away as the whole family being strange and fucked up. 

But then love and other demons paints the child as a seductress to a priest (if I remember right) and love in the time of cholera has one of the main characters grooming a family member then discarding her when he has a chance to reclaim his lost love.",1709241870,210,"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1b3btyi/is_pedophilia_a_common_theme_in_gabriel_garcia/"
