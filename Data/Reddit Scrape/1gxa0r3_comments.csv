"lyg6bqk","lateintheseason","2024-11-22 17:54:22 UTC","One thing I like about Reddit is that the anonymity allows you to be a bit more critical about what you're reading.

I find that many bookstagrammers are uniformly positive in their reviews, but let's be honest -- not every book is a 3-plus star book. I think their (bookstagrammers') desire to connect with authors and publishers leads to inflated reviews. On Reddit, you can articulate your critical thoughts without fear of backlash (and if you're being baselessly critical or rude, you'll likely get down voted anyway, so that seems like an appropriate outcome).",""

My feed would always return to the same books. Then I tried again with Regency era literature and the only recommendation I would get that was actually from that time period (as opposed to modern Erotica with a historical setting) was - yes, you've guessed it - Jane Austen. 

I'm sure it's ""fantastic"" if you happen to like Fantasy-Romance-Erotica type of books but are relatively new to the genre and don't know all the TikTok favorites yet. But I think for more experienced readers TikTok won't have much to offer after a while either.

I have gotten a lot of great queer and foreign book recs from TikTok. The horror recs really varied in their quality. Some of my favorite books I have read in recent years were recommended there surprisingly though. The Rooftop by Fernanda Trias, Paradise Rot by Jenny Hval, and the indigenous horror anthology Never Whistle at Night were all examples of books recommended to me on TikTok that I bought, read, and loved. I don't really get the typical TikTok book recs like dark romance/fantasy but I think a big part of that is the algorithm knows I am not straight and don't read a lot of straight romance.

**Tiktok:** Terrible taste in book recommendations, but great for memes of books I've already read.

**Instagram:** I mostly follow authors, not readers. This is my primary source of upcoming book announcements.

**Goodreads:** I follow a lot of readers with similar taste and can get a much better idea of if I'll like a book based on reviews from people I follow than the site-wide ratings. I add (and remove) a lot of books to my TBR from the reviews in my home feed and occasionally pick up recommendations from their articles.

"lygf8o8","beldaran1224","2024-11-22 18:40:16 UTC","I'm only involved with book stuff here and on TikTok, so I'll speak to TikTok.


First is that TikTok very recently added group chats. So recently I haven't even used them yet. But they exist.


Second is that it really is a highly personal algorithm and this has both good things and bad. Personally, I think only having one avenue to explore media is the real problem, and if you use multiple avenues that do different things well, you'll end up with a more well rounded experience.


I actually think the carousel of book covers type of video on TikTok isn't very interesting or useful for me. As a librarian and a long time member of this sub, I have exposure to a much wider array of books than the average TikTok video of this sort can do. But what it excels at is more niche topics. I follow a number of accounts which have specific niches they're very interested in, or types of criticism or topics they want to explore. Those provide value to me. For instance, general genre accounts aren't helpful. But an account who focuses on Sapphic books or self pubbed books or books from a specific culture or whatever? Gold, pure gold for me.",""
"lyifspj","Mabel_Waddles_BFF","2024-11-23 01:33:09 UTC","I find the Reddit book spaces to be less toxic. There are some lovely people on the other platforms but there’s also a lot of nastiness. 

Examples: 
- The Sarah J Mass devotes hassling authors who have things like fae, magic, winter courts, or who are drawing on mythology. Apparently Sarah J Mass invented everything. 

- I think it started on Twitter (not calling it X) but a reader decided that a romance book with two adults was actually a p#dophilic romance. Their reasoning: the name of the protagonist was the same as a Danish prince, who was 12 when the book was written. The author has plenty of proof there was no connection and it wasn’t it an unusual name. But the person who started it kept going and the author received a bunch of death threats and r#pe threats. The author is now suing for defamation.

- An author sent out a PR box with their book to a small-time reviewer. The reviewer didn’t like the book and gave a well-justified critique of it on Goodreads. So the author went online, doxxed them and incited an outraged group to go after the reviewer. When the tide turned against the author their apology was along the lines of ‘I’m sorry I didn’t mope at home’. Not how shitty it was to doxx someone, intentionally send a bunch of people after them and try to buy a good review. 


This one isn’t to do with toxicity but it still irks me. I’m not a big romance or fantasy reader (except the occasional urban fantasy). But my algorithm is just endless romantasy indie authors. I don’t know if it’s because the algorithm knows I’m a woman or if romantasy is the biggest genre right now. But I would really like some different genres, especially by indie authors.

And even the people i follow who promote on their tiktoks are active in other ways, they share fellow author’s books of similar genres or themes or make content that is in line with the literature/reading they consume.

The bulk of where people would seem to engage is the review section. Reviews are dominated by people who seem to really enjoy reading their own writing, and they seem territorial about it. Even writing a short three sentence review on the book feels discouraged when several people have already posted dissertation level essays on the same book.

The details are different, but the basic advice is the same, as if we've gone so far from curatable social media that we've circled back around to using the same methods that algorithms were supposed to remove.","lyggbog"

I hear people describe this with Pinterest, saying it only shows them things from 2012, but then if you ask if they ever pin things they see elsewhere online that they like, they say no. Every time I finish a book I like I search it on TikTok, watch a couple videos and move on. The algorithm immediately figured out to push the morbidly curious book club based on my love of weird niche nonfiction and gave me author accounts to follow for people who match my interests. I don’t think I’d ever have thought of them as people who would be on TikTok but there they are. I love my algorithm because I get rescue dogs, niche reads, restoring century homes, meal prepping and urbanism thanks to how I seed it. ","lyggbog"

When I was a bookstagrammer I worked with them a few times until I got super frustrated with the buddy reads and just pulled out completely. It was the most soulless experience because the other ""readers"" were just after the free book and not the actual you know, community, and they kept choosing the same awful people every time, who were already on publisher lists so were already getting reviewer copies of the books. TC always gave very little communication or it would be last minute, but then demand a huge amount of content creation from you in return for getting the book - despite selling their whole schtick about buddy reading and having an online book club community. I bailed out quickly after that. Reading their answers to this post they're clearly farming for ways they can sink into other communities.","lyhsn9q"

Also sometimes there'll be a post on there that triggers memories of a book I loved when I was a kid but haven't thought about in a while, like for example someone was asking for books written from the perspective of an animal, and that reminded me how much I enjoyed Pagoo by Holling C.

That social aspect seems ... a little dead ... now, and I simply can't imagine forming a human connection there anymore, but I wonder if that's just because I'm not so immersed in it.  I still write reviews, it's a great tool for lists and recommendations and so on but something changed.  However it's still going strong as a platform!","lyftmc5"

"lyh4p80","purple_haze00","2024-11-22 20:54:23 UTC","Storygraph is an alternative but there isn't an option to comment on someone's review and although I see your point about certain reviews not being pushed to the top, I did like the option of being able to 'like' someone's review. It was feedback (as are comments) and so I find that less friendly than goodreads for interacting with other readers. 

Unfortunately there are a fair few books that aren't listed in the system on Storygraph and only have one or a handful of reviews. I know it's much newer than Goodreads though. 

I do appreciate the options in reviews for choosing the mood of the book (I try and stay away from books that are dark), the pace (I tend to dislike slower paced books), and the trigger warnings. It helps me understand the feel of the book before reading it and if I see that there is graphic content of war and other distressing things, combined with it being rated as dark I realise this is likely a book I won't enjoy. I also feel like I can contribute and hopefully be helpful to others this way, without leaving a written review.","lygdvlm"

"lyhnk4q","Violet2393","2024-11-22 22:37:59 UTC","I saw something about this recently - currently YouTube keeps track of how long people spend watching your content and will ding a video if people spend a shorter time watching it - even if they are watching a whole video that just happens to be shorter. 

The effect is that once creators get into longer content they kind of have to keep their content longer and shorter videos won’t get promoted as much. 

I really hate that - one of the things I like about YT is the variety of lengths available so I can fit what I’m watching to how much time I have. The harder it is for me to find something that fits in my timeframe, the less I will be watching.","lyfnxua"

"lyi15tu","beldaran1224","2024-11-23 00:00:12 UTC","Yeah, I'm a millennial who's absolutely stopped using more traditional social media like FB simply because the feed is useless. It's exhausting trying to filter through bs to see what's going on in people's lives.","lyhfyf1"
"lyi35a1","beldaran1224","2024-11-23 00:12:35 UTC","There are a few things to keep in mind:


1) Watching matters, but isn't ""enough"". What matters more is more active participation. So even if you thought the cute cat video was fun, don't heart it if you don't want your feed to have more of it.


2) The more popular something is, the more content that exists for it out there, the more ruthless you have to be to purge it. So cute animal videos will immediately take over your feed if you engage with them.


3) Prioritize accounts and videos with niche content and engage more aggressively with that content to boost it. It's absolutely OK to comment something inane like ""commenting for the algorithm"" or ""boost"". If you watch more popular stuff but don't want it dominating, consider either using a different account, a different platform or merely watching and not actively engaging with it.


4) Long hold and click ""not interested"" when something you don't want in your feed comes up, especially if you watched it thinking it might be something else. Do this even if it's something you enjoyed, if you don't want it in your feed.


5) It's OK to just want to watch cute animal videos or other popular content. Just know that it's popularity means it'll push out more niche content.


6) You get to recognize what sort of content it is pretty quickly as a general rule. It takes time, but you'll start recognize the account, the trend, etc and be able to scroll past.


7) Once your feed is more curated you can be less aggressive about it, but you can't stop curating. So you can watch the occasional cat video, but each one you watch increases the ones you're exposed to.


8) Actively use the ""following"" feed, especially to curate your feed. If your FYP gets weird, swap to Following and engage, engage, engage. If you stop seeing someone you follow, seek out their page and scroll through their recent stuff and re-engage.


TikTok is great for some types of content and even when curating never gets stale. But as I said, if you treat all of your social media this way, you'll end up in an echo chamber. I find it makes the most sense to use different platforms differently, and always make sure to actively seek out real sources and real info. If you consume political commentary, for instance, make sure you aren't getting your news from social media.","lyhifsj"
