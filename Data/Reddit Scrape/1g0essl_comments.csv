Blume dared to take on the kinds of topics that concern kids a lot but adults don't like to discuss with them, like menstruation and masturbation. Cleary wrote from the kid's point of view and created bold, memorable characters in situations that transcended their details. Long after woolen underwear was a thing, kids relate to the awkwardness of Ellen Tibbits and the joy of finding a friend who understands you, for example.",""

Again he's a great writer but sometimes I wish that instead of writing three books he'd spent more time rereading and adjusting the one book. I have no problem with a long book either, but not one that is long because it's overly repetitive, or worse is excruciatingly long and then doesn't stick the landing.","lr8oaxv"

"lr8mwpb","Acrelorraine","2024-10-10 12:05:32 UTC","Crichton wrote and directed a lot of his own book adaptations.  He had the connections and clout within Hollywood to turn his books into movies.  Many of them were well regarded.  

Pratchett has had significantly fewer of his books made into movies, though if you include tv series and the one short film, it's about 15, not far off of Crichton.  Again, though, Pratchett didn't get to helm several of these projects, for better or worse.  Especially worse in the case of The Watch.  But Pratchett stories also see a surprising amount of stage plays.  

If we just look at literary awards, I also couldn't say.  Pratchett won a lot of them.  It's hard to find a simple and comprehensive list.  It's harder to find a list for Crichton since his awards have a lot of television and film work mixed in, and one award for being in the top 50 attractive men listings.  

On the other hand, Pratchett was knighted and had his own sword forged from stone and meteorites he collected.  

This is personal opinion, both versions of Timeline sucked and Tim Curry couldn't save Congo.","lr8ek24"

Most popular writers never even write one, much less more than one. If one were to go into the bookstore, out of all the shelves of fiction, how many are GREAT novels? Practically none.

King could easily be a Dan Brown or John Grisham, but unlike them, he is both prolific and, occasionally, brilliant. If we metaphorically threw away all his non-brilliant books, he’d still be up there with Steinbeck and Hemingway, for those novels of his that do hit that level.","lr8uufm"

Yes, there are some that write essentially the same book again and again - Jack Reacher gets off a bus and stumbles into someone else's problem. Buys a new shirt and doesn't need a bag. But I know what I'm getting into. If Reacher suddenly decided to settle down and become a chiropodist I would be disappointed.

Terry Pratchett will bring me on a completely unexpected and usually delightful journey around the disc. Never knowing what to expect but again confident that I'll enjoy the journey, the witty observations and not take it too seriously.

Iain M Banks will create an epic new universe and bring me on journeys within it that will blow my mind time and time again.

Adrian Tchaikovsky will write one series about sentient space spiders and another about a planet destroying godlike entities and I'll see his next novel about a robot that is struggling with self awareness and be willing to give it a whirl and not be disappointed (and I wasn't).

Clare Mackintosh will have imperfect characters that you feel for and an intriguing murder mystery.

Yes, you might spend time in a bookshop wading through books that aren't for you, but when you hit upon an author that writes a couple of books you like you should be able to count on them to deliver. You mightn't LOVE every one of their books but shouldn't be getting to the end rolling your eyes or feeling cheated because God came along and blew up all the bad guys.","lrd4uu4"
