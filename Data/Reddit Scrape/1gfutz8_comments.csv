Personally I love the joy of reading it the way the author intended me to read it, and having the surprises and unexpected delights along the way. But I’m also a re-reader, so I understand what you’re saying— and there are some books I go back to over and over and understand them better each time.

There are two ways of reading a book: knowing what happens, and not knowing what happens. You only have the one opportunity to experience the first option, then you can experience the second option as many times as you want.

A good book shouldn't be ""spoilt"" by spoilers. I totally believe that good books are often improved by knowing what will happen. But I only have that one opportunity to read the book without spoilers, and want to experience that.",""

Sure, when you're reading it, you're going to forget stuff, or you're going to speed through Chapter 26 of 28 as the climax is coming, but you're only ever going to get to experience that once.  If you miss anything, that's what rereads are for.

Just as an example, I've read Dune twice.  The first time was an amazing and unique experience.  The second time allowed me to take what I knew about where the story would lead and put it in a new light, allowing me to catch details and plot events that I hadn't paid attention to the first time, but I would never give up the experience of not knowing, the feeling of excitement and anxiety about what was going to happen next, just so that I can be more attentive in a reading.

I do not read the ending in advance or read synopses online or anything like that; and if I know I'm interested enough to read the book already, then I don't read the blurb or reviews either.

As for missing things along the way like foreshadowing, I sort of see that as the point: If you liked the book, then someday you give it a re-read, and how rewarding of a re-read it will be!

As far as blowing through a book just to get to the finale, I suppose that is a problem; but the solution, I think, is not in spoiling endings, but in learning the *discipline* of soaking the story in as you go rather than misprioritizing the ending.",""

There is no chance of anyone convincing me that there is a right or wrong way to read a book (unless, idk, it involves not reading it at all?) and my advice to you is to just read the way you want to read and ignore everyone else’s lectures about the “right” way to enjoy it.",""

"luko6iu","Level_Film_3025","2024-10-30 19:31:00 UTC","Very rarely. Sometimes with books I know are difficult classics, translated books, or particularly ""important"" reads, I'll look up the plot beforehand so I can follow along better and really absorb the prose and writing decisions without being distracted by trying to figure out what's going on. For example; I dont think I ever would have finished reading Pride and Prejudice had I not already known the plot.

And while it's not exactly the same concept: I do tend to believe that a well written mystery can be enjoyed *more* when you already know the plot, so that you can follow along with the clues (not that that stops me from trying to figure out the first time). I found Murder On the Orient Express delightful the second time around because of this.

ETA: While I try not to spoil things for others, depending on the age of the students (really any class over 12 years old), in an educational setting I would expect any student to know that the primary goal of reading a book in class is going to be analysis, and so they should expect spoilers and take their own initiative to read ahead if they want to finish the story unspoiled.",""

You never have another chance to fall in love with a character for the first time, or feel the gut punch of that beloved side character dying, or experience the Shamalan twist twisting again. You can only be unspoiled once and I think that feeling should be reveled in. 

But I do love to appreciate all the little details and literary devices and threads woven through a great story. I want to see all the hints I missed before and appreciate the character development and really focus on the plot without that anxiety of not knowing what comes next, which is why I’m also an advocate for re-reading good books.

I started Stephen King's Dark Tower series with NO idea what I was in for. My husband saw it on a list of King's best books and bought it on a whim. It's now my favorite series ever.

Recently I spoiled a movie for myself by looking up in advance if one of the main characters died (and he did) and when the moment came, the emotional impact wasn’t as large as if I hadn’t seen it coming.

There are times when the journey is the main point and the destination doesn’t matter. Like for instance when I care about the characters, their relationships, their mini adventures more than about some overarching plot. But there are also plenty of times when the ending matters to me. Or sometimes not even the ending but the general direction. 

To give you a couple of silly examples. 

Harry Potter books were all about the journey for me. The big baddie, the main fight of good vs evil — that was background. It was obvious the story was gonna end well, so I wasn’t worried about that. What I cared about is the adventure, the fun on every page.

But then take science fiction books. I am very particular about what I want and what I don’t want to read/watch. There are certain plots that I just don’t want to spend my time on. I read for fun not for personal growth and education. So I need to be more or less certain I am going to have fun with the story.

Then there are stories with some sort of big mystery. With these I just get impatient. I can read/watch a little, but at some point I just want the answer “right now”. If it’s satisfactory, I will continue reading/watching. If it’s not, I will just abandon the story.",""

I remember reading The Castle and having no idea what was the story line, andbeing really discombobulated because I had never read Kafka. I kind of couldn’t follow what was going on for some reason.

Just as you mentioned, I appreciate foreshadowing, symbolisms, themes and motifs much better knowing the outcome of the story: imagine seeing everything coming full circle have built to that moment in time—to me it is far more rewarding than the excitement and surprise alone. 


Perhaps there's this idea of not spoiling the first read, but I seldom find it worth to do a second read (even upon rereading I usually just do my favourite segments), so I really prefer delving into the story knowing all there is to know, backgrounds, themes, motifs, the works. Far better analysis with the info received. 


I suppose I simply don't derive that much enjoyment from surprises—that and I prefer seeing how things unfurls informed of the gist. It also takes great momentum to kickstart reading or watching anything (once I get the inertia I binge), so spoiling it partially really helps with cultivating the interest. (okay if this is a dystopian fiction and they are in a simulation I prefer that unspoiled maybe; I kind of want to know how they get out though, who's good and who's not, who gets together in the end.)",""

There are certainly stories that benefit from the reader/viewer not knowing what's coming (detective storylines, mysteries etc), and yes, it wouldn't be as interesting to read a Sherlock Holmes story if you knew the twist beforehand. But I also re-read and rewatched those stories and enjoyed them. The Sixth Sense is an interesting example - I knew the twist long ago because I like movies and watching analysis videos on Youtube. Last week I finally sat down to watch it with my partner (who also hasn't seen the movie and didn't know the twist). He guessed it after about 1/3 of the movie. It was quite on the surface, not like in that ""village in the forest"" movie. So did my knowledge spoil anything for me? not really. 

When it comes to modern books, I often select-read some comments and reviews beforehand, including those marked as ""spoiler"". This is often because I want to know if there's stuff I don't want to read about. I wanted to read A Little Life after its resurgence on social media. Then I read what it's about in more detail, and I understood that it's not something I need right now.

I read it a second time a few years later, with a third-party text, and understood much of what I missed. But the first reading was much more enjoyable. Personally, I lose a lot of enjoyment when I try too hard to understand everything an author might have intended for me to understand. If I like a book very much I will read it again and approach it with a more analytical mind. But that's just my preference.","lukytq5"

I may read it someday but I am not a fan of dystopias. I get too upset at injustice.","lukwzhg"
"lul66aq","horsetuna","2024-10-30 20:57:48 UTC","I like to also read the plots for horror movies and stuff on wikipedia. I consider it a 'lite' version of the actual horror so I can enjoy the story. I suspect (Being an enjoyer of Junji Ito) that its the MEDIUM of horror movies that disturb me. Its too realistic in many cases.  But the Manga doesnt have that effect. OTOH, I may have just matured and mellowed out.","lukwzhg"

Every time he was the MC I’d be like, “oh boy, let’s see what antics Lestat’s about to get up to next!” I loved the stories told from the perspective of other characters too, but man, any time Lestat showed up, it was hard to not root for his chaos.","lul35zw"
"lum8cci","party4diamondz","2024-10-31 00:23:27 UTC","Hahaha I've been partly slowed down by interest in other books/inability to get a hand on specific TVC books, but this year I've definitely sped up on it and I've been wanting to ride the momentum and get to the damn end!!! It feels like yesterday that the 13th book felt like it'd take ages to get to, but now I feel so close.

So it seems we might have conflicting perspectives (totally fine) so keep that in mind here 😂😂 I wasn't interested in delving into Mayfair Witches so I went into Merrick without reading them. I did enjoy it but I do think it's been my least fav so far, if I had to rank them, but again that's probably mostly due to me missing the vampire stuff and not vibing as much with Merrick. And again while I didn't have a *problem* with David Talbot's POV and do enjoy him as a character, he wasn't as interesting of a POV to be in. 

I was dreading reading Blood and Gold because I'd not liked Marius from previous books but... I ended up really enjoying it. I still disliked *him* but I found his perspective unique and he experienced such vast things in his 2000 or so years of life! I also found myself really captivated by the whole ancient vampires which is why I read Pandora next (not part of TVC, but adjacent to Marius's story). There's also a lot of side-characters who I was interested in, and then of course the sad introduction of Amadeo/Armand but this time from Marius's POV, learning about how Marius viewed him and their 'relationship'.

If you're into the witches stuff I could see you enjoying Blackwood Farm, as it's handling more spirit-y stuff (and also finally Lestat's return!!! I'm embarrassingly giddy every time he's on the page after his long ass coma lol)","lum1lpk"
"luljcd6","Thelmara","2024-10-30 22:04:49 UTC","I don't think it ruins endings, necessarily, but it's hard to hold tension the way the author intends if you already know the reveals that are coming.

In the story I'm (re-)reading now, there's a point where one of the main characters appears to die.  There are clues, including one big, kick-yourself-in-retrospect obvious tip-off, but 2.5 million words into the story it's not a detail that's gotten a lot of focus, and so I completely missed it.  The tension of ""Oh shit, is she really gone?  Is the rest of the team totally fucked?"" over the next dozen or so chapters was great. And the chapter where we find out that she didn't, and then her friends get to find out that she's okay when she comes crashing back into the story to kick ass and help defeat the bad guy, the relief of it all, both our own and for the other protagonists.  It's just so great, and that's one of the things that you just can't ramp up as hard when you know what's coming.","lukz9vf"
"lul4uzz","Veteranis","2024-10-30 20:51:22 UTC","I too enjoy reading a novel or story as an *author’s creation*—the choices made and details emphasized—rather than as an unfolding of plot points. I don’t usually seek to know the ending in advance, but if I do, it doesn’t actually “spoil” anything for me. There’s still all those details to attend to.","lukunbf"
"lulv4c5","estheredna","2024-10-30 23:09:34 UTC","You can see those choices if you don't know the ending in real time too?  I don't really see the benefit.

Say there is a thriller with an obvious suspect and  3 red herrings.  
If you don't know the ending, you know there are 4 suspects and you make discermnets based on the author's words.   You can both experience the storytelling and understand the mechanics of it.

If you know it's suspect B, and suspects A, C, and D are all innocent.... to me that's half the story.  The meta narrative.  How it works.    Which is *fine,* but I can't see how it's better.","lukunbf"

I don't (typically) read horror, but I'll try just about anything else. I'll usually try to power through non-fiction if I think it has useful information, but getting one of my degrees in English eliminated any desire I had for pushing myself through fiction I don't enjoy.","luksga5"

"luob3dk","Lizz196","2024-10-31 10:40:43 UTC","If it’s a murder mystery, sure. But sometimes I get really worked up about it, and it’s a more pleasant experience to know what happens.","lumzbgo"
"lumc4z5","Lizz196","2024-10-31 00:44:19 UTC","I’ve been reading them on kindle, because yeah, you can’t really find them anywhere. Though I think the original covers for Body Thief and Memnoch are so beautiful that I’m going to ask for copies Christmas. Especially because those two have been my favorite so far, I keep mentally returning to the premise of Memnoch. 

I’ve noticed every one of her books is wildly divisive in the fandom, so I think some people prefer the more lore heavy, POV books and others prefer the more plot-driven books. I’m definitely the latter. 

I hadn’t intended on reading the Mayfair Witches, but I had seen people say it helps you understand the characters better in Merrick, Blackwood Farm, and the Blood Canticle. So I was like, why not, I’m already tackling a hugely dense and lengthy series! 

I’ll probably read Marius’ book anyways. I’m the type of person that’s going to finish the series, even if it kills me.","lum8cci"

"lumdka5","party4diamondz","2024-10-31 00:52:20 UTC","Ok I love hearing that Body Thief and Memnoch are your favourites. I found the former SO FUN and so different to the rest, and Memnoch I feel like people hardly talk about but it took me on such a journey omg! I think when I finish the series I'll eventually get to reread those ones too. I just love reading about Lestat on these crazy adventures.

And yes, you're totally right there. I think I would have fared better with understanding some stuff I read MW first but oh well, I'm here now 😂 She usually does a decent job and re-introducing characters each book anyway to give a basic premise on their history and what kind of person they are.","lumc4z5"
"lums3hx","ruby-has-feelings","2024-10-31 02:15:08 UTC","That's so valid and I'm so sorry that's happened. You're not dumb at all you just have a different way of doing this and it came from a place of wanting to better understand the texts like your teacher taught. I think that shows how smart you are for wanting to have that insight at all, so many are happy to just inhale a book and move on to the next with little thought. 

Your way of reading is perfect for you! Stick to what works for you and ignore the assholes. Being like everyone else is boring anyway 💛✨","lumrnbk"
"lumg1q0","Lizz196","2024-10-31 01:06:28 UTC","Body Thief and Memnoch are such unique takes on tropes. Now I have no understanding of Christianity or Catholicism, I’m an agnostic-leaning atheist, but Memnoch really got me questioning the idea of a benevolent God. I really want to re-read it the most. I think I’ll get more out of it on round two. 

Honestly, I think the Mayfair Witches is better than the Vampire Chronicles. I find the writing and story to be much more compelling. It also really made me appreciate how well Anne Rice is capable of telling different POVs. Each character really does sound different across the universe. Most authors aren’t good about creating different voices.","lumdka5"
