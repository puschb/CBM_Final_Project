There are two ways of reading a book: knowing what happens, and not knowing what happens. You only have the one opportunity to experience the first option, then you can experience the second option as many times as you want.

Sure, when you're reading it, you're going to forget stuff, or you're going to speed through Chapter 26 of 28 as the climax is coming, but you're only ever going to get to experience that once.  If you miss anything, that's what rereads are for.

Just as an example, I've read Dune twice.  The first time was an amazing and unique experience.  The second time allowed me to take what I knew about where the story would lead and put it in a new light, allowing me to catch details and plot events that I hadn't paid attention to the first time, but I would never give up the experience of not knowing, the feeling of excitement and anxiety about what was going to happen next, just so that I can be more attentive in a reading.

As for missing things along the way like foreshadowing, I sort of see that as the point: If you liked the book, then someday you give it a re-read, and how rewarding of a re-read it will be!

As far as blowing through a book just to get to the finale, I suppose that is a problem; but the solution, I think, is not in spoiling endings, but in learning the *discipline* of soaking the story in as you go rather than misprioritizing the ending.",""

Sometimes with books I know are difficult classics, translated books, or particularly ""important"" reads, I'll look up the plot beforehand so I can follow along better and really absorb the prose and writing decisions without being distracted by trying to figure out what's going on. For example; I dont think I ever would have finished reading Pride and Prejudice had I not already known the plot.

And while it's not exactly the same concept: I do tend to believe that a well written mystery can be enjoyed *more* when you already know the plot, so that you can follow along with the clues (not that that stops me from trying to figure out the first time). I found Murder On the Orient Express delightful the second time around because of this.

ETA: While I try not to spoil things for others, depending on the age of the students (really any class over 12 years old), in an educational setting I would expect any student to know that the primary goal of reading a book in class is going to be analysis, and so they should expect spoilers and take their own initiative to read ahead if they want to finish the story unspoiled.",""

Perhaps there's this idea of not spoiling the first read, but I seldom find it worth to do a second read (even upon rereading I usually just do my favourite segments), so I really prefer delving into the story knowing all there is to know, backgrounds, themes, motifs, the works.

Last week I finally sat down to watch it with my partner (who also hasn't seen the movie and didn't know the twist). He guessed it after about 1/3 of the movie. It was quite on the surface, not like in that ""village in the forest"" movie. So did my knowledge spoil anything for me? not really. 

When it comes to modern books, I often select-read some comments and reviews beforehand, including those marked as ""spoiler"".

I get frustrated when I can see the author is trying to tell me something deeper, but I basically don‚Äôt have the key to unlocking it since I‚Äôve mostly just read for pleasure. 

I notice in all of my media consumption, not just books, that I pay attention more when my mind isn‚Äôt wandering to what‚Äôs next, which is why I like to spoil stuff. 

While I‚Äôm reading, I‚Äôll get so excited about what happens next I‚Äôll often skip whole paragraphs and lose parts of the story. 

I do re-read books. I love re-reading books. And that‚Äôs often how I find out I accidentally skipped sections of the book.

And I do have an inner monologue, it also speaks fast too.","luls1rg"

"lul23eu","Soft-Proof6372","2024-10-30 20:37:55 UTC","I wouldn't like to prescribe any way for you to read. While I have opinions on what I think is better or worse, it is not my place to tell anyone they are wrong or that they should change what works for them. Obviously, many authors have a deeper subtext in their writing that might not be easy to pick up on without a lot of stewing, or more context. When I read Ulysses for the first time I just read the book without any third party literature or guidance. A great deal of allusion and metaphor went right over my head, and some chapters were a confusing blur, but it didn't matter to me because I was lost in the story and the beautiful prose. I read it a second time a few years later, with a third-party text, and understood much of what I missed. But the first reading was much more enjoyable. Personally, I lose a lot of enjoyment when I try too hard to understand everything an author might have intended for me to understand. If I like a book very much I will read it again and approach it with a more analytical mind. But that's just my preference.","lukytq5"

"lul66aq","horsetuna","2024-10-30 20:57:48 UTC","I like to also read the plots for horror movies and stuff on wikipedia. I consider it a 'lite' version of the actual horror so I can enjoy the story. I suspect (Being an enjoyer of Junji Ito) that its the MEDIUM of horror movies that disturb me. Its too realistic in many cases.  But the Manga doesnt have that effect. OTOH, I may have just matured and mellowed out.","lukwzhg"

"lum8cci","party4diamondz","2024-10-31 00:23:27 UTC","Hahaha I've been partly slowed down by interest in other books/inability to get a hand on specific TVC books, but this year I've definitely sped up on it and I've been wanting to ride the momentum and get to the damn end!!! It feels like yesterday that the 13th book felt like it'd take ages to get to, but now I feel so close.

So it seems we might have conflicting perspectives (totally fine) so keep that in mind here üòÇüòÇ I wasn't interested in delving into Mayfair Witches so I went into Merrick without reading them. I did enjoy it but I do think it's been my least fav so far, if I had to rank them, but again that's probably mostly due to me missing the vampire stuff and not vibing as much with Merrick. And again while I didn't have a *problem* with David Talbot's POV and do enjoy him as a character, he wasn't as interesting of a POV to be in. 

I was dreading reading Blood and Gold because I'd not liked Marius from previous books but... I ended up really enjoying it. I still disliked *him* but I found his perspective unique and he experienced such vast things in his 2000 or so years of life! I also found myself really captivated by the whole ancient vampires which is why I read Pandora next (not part of TVC, but adjacent to Marius's story). There's also a lot of side-characters who I was interested in, and then of course the sad introduction of Amadeo/Armand but this time from Marius's POV, learning about how Marius viewed him and their 'relationship'.

If you're into the witches stuff I could see you enjoying Blackwood Farm, as it's handling more spirit-y stuff (and also finally Lestat's return!!! I'm embarrassingly giddy every time he's on the page after his long ass coma lol)","lum1lpk"
"luljcd6","Thelmara","2024-10-30 22:04:49 UTC","I don't think it ruins endings, necessarily, but it's hard to hold tension the way the author intends if you already know the reveals that are coming.

In the story I'm (re-)reading now, there's a point where one of the main characters appears to die.  There are clues, including one big, kick-yourself-in-retrospect obvious tip-off, but 2.5 million words into the story it's not a detail that's gotten a lot of focus, and so I completely missed it.  The tension of ""Oh shit, is she really gone?  Is the rest of the team totally fucked?"" over the next dozen or so chapters was great. And the chapter where we find out that she didn't, and then her friends get to find out that she's okay when she comes crashing back into the story to kick ass and help defeat the bad guy, the relief of it all, both our own and for the other protagonists.  It's just so great, and that's one of the things that you just can't ramp up as hard when you know what's coming.","lukz9vf"

"lulv4c5","estheredna","2024-10-30 23:09:34 UTC","You can see those choices if you don't know the ending in real time too?  I don't really see the benefit.

Say there is a thriller with an obvious suspect and  3 red herrings.  
If you don't know the ending, you know there are 4 suspects and you make discermnets based on the author's words.   You can both experience the storytelling and understand the mechanics of it.

If you know it's suspect B, and suspects A, C, and D are all innocent.... to me that's half the story.  The meta narrative.  How it works.    Which is *fine,* but I can't see how it's better.","lukunbf"

Especially because those two have been my favorite so far, I keep mentally returning to the premise of Memnoch. 

I‚Äôve noticed every one of her books is wildly divisive in the fandom, so I think some people prefer the more lore heavy, POV books and others prefer the more plot-driven books. I‚Äôm definitely the latter. 

I hadn‚Äôt intended on reading the Mayfair Witches, but I had seen people say it helps you understand the characters better in Merrick, Blackwood Farm, and the Blood Canticle. So I was like, why not, I‚Äôm already tackling a hugely dense and lengthy series!

And yes, you're totally right there.

You're not dumb at all you just have a different way of doing this and it came from a place of wanting to better understand the texts like your teacher taught. I think that shows how smart you are for wanting to have that insight at all, so many are happy to just inhale a book and move on to the next with little thought.

I really want to re-read it the most. I think I‚Äôll get more out of it on round two. 

Honestly, I think the Mayfair Witches is better than the Vampire Chronicles. I find the writing and story to be much more compelling. It also really made me appreciate how well Anne Rice is capable of telling different POVs. Each character really does sound different across the universe. Most authors aren‚Äôt good about creating different voices.","lumdka5"
