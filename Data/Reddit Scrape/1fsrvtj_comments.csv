I read **Paradise Lost by John Milton**. Nothing has dethroned Shakespeare, but this comes very close. I just love the epic fantasy and the way it‚Äôs written, with the imagery and the prose. Unfortunately, copy I had presented it as a wall of text (Project Gutenberg online direct webpage), so I just focused on the writing and what parts I could, looking at the rest later. It helped to treat each part as its own story and read it like one of the epic poems, which is almost what it‚Äôs designed for anyway. I could see comparisons to His Dark Materials, Chronicles of Narnia, the Odyssey and even Faust. Plus I always love biblical retellings and that much I could catch right away. When I went to go read the summary later to try and catch the parts I missed, the thing that struck out to be the most of the subversion of the hero‚Äôs quest, and that the person followed for most of the book really wasn‚Äôt heroic at all (even if he was sympathetic and might‚Äôve originally been on the right side of the history; a lot of interpretations are ambiguous). Overall, it‚Äôs very well done.

My next book I want to at least try as **Great Expectations by Charles Dickens** I‚Äôve never read Dickens before outside of seeing the Christmas Carol and various adaptations and things based off of it, so that‚Äôs going to be interesting and not something I expect to finish in a single week. I did try to read a summary of Moby Dick before the school year ended last year, but I didn‚Äôt really like what I read (I enjoyed the adventure portion but it was a bit too graphic and tragic for me, although I can see why it‚Äôs so beloved and it is written well. I do love the Christmas Carol though, so it will be interesting to see what I make of his other works. Especially since I‚Äôll probably be reading them for a while if all goes well.",""

"lpn6fzh","Safkhet","2024-09-30 13:01:36 UTC","Work has been crazy this last month, so I‚Äôve not posted here and only gone through a few books in that time.

**Failure Mode, by Craig Alanson**  
Book 15 of ExFor series and where the author had originally intended to end the series. And what an end that was. The final conflict was full of nail-biting tension and though you could tell, even at the start of the book, that the resolution would not be without some major loss, it still bulldozed over my feeble defences and a surprisingly large quantity of freshly cut onions. Loved the little nods to *The Expanse*.  

**Aftermath, by Craig Alanson**  
Book 16 of ExFor series. What was it about the series ending at book 15?! Well, this was a very good example of never say never. I started the book and was immediately deflated. It felt unnecessary, with needless filler and recounting of past events, yet, a few chapters in, I was back in my familiar land of comfort: space hide and seek, shoot‚Äôem ups, and sketchy problem solving. I should really have this engraved somewhere ‚Äì TTA!  

**The Plague, by Albert Camus**  
I expected dry semi philosophical ramblings √† la *The Myth of Sisyphus*, so imagine my surprise to find a clear and compelling narrative of one city‚Äôs descent into hopelessness and suffering. Reading this so soon after the pandemic was difficult to say the least and the final loss, after hope had been so passionately stirred up, so much more palpable. A heart-wrenching read.  

**Cool Hand Luke, by Donn Pearce**  
I‚Äôve loved the film since my school days but never quite understood the affinity that I felt toward the main character until I read this book. I knew exactly what to expect at every turn of the page, yet, it had zero impact on my immersion. How can something so simple so unadorned be so effective? The laid-back exploration of Lloyd‚Äôs war trauma, his self-sabotage, and subsequent self-assured destruction, as he quietly raged against the machine and God, with that wry smile of his and an occasional wink, brought up a lot of uncomfortable memories, cementing his character as one of my all-time favourites. This is why I insist on never letting spoilers deter me from exploring a book, you never know what other surprises the author might have in store for you.

I just finished Killers of the Flower Moon (by David Grann), and it really made me reflect on my experience reading There There (by Tommy Orange) a few years ago. I'm a white American and don't know many Native Americans, and so these books really opened my eyes a bit to the Native experience. Growing up in school, I learned first about the supposed cooperation between Pilgrims and Natives, and then later in High School I got a more honest lesson about the tragedies/killing/oppression of Native people. But it always seemed to be a ""history"" lesson. Something that happened to a people way back then.

These books, give the modern reader a view into what it is to be Native in modern America. In the case of Killers, the reader gets a view of the treatment of Natives in a modern context. Yes it was 100 years ago, but it is easy for the reader to see how the Osage are a part of a modern industry (oil) and how they were treated in an era where modern forensics could have been used to stop their murder.

In There There (albeit realistic fiction), the reader sees the nitty gritty lives, for better and worse, of a series of Natives whose lives revolve around Oakland. Going back to History class, we're taught today to think of Natives as living on reservations, in Oklahoma, in rural areas, eking it out on a farm, or running a casino (which are just the stereotypes). It wasn't until I read this book that I really THOUGHT about Natives living everywhere in America that people live, including inner cities. Their lives are often tragic, often beautiful. They hold onto traditions, they're mixed race and adopt new traditions.

The common thread I felt through these two books are that they really humanize the Native American population. It gives them names and faces, wrestles with them as individuals rather than a chapter in a textbook. Any other readers of these books have thoughts?",""

**The Empire of Gold, by S. A. Chakraborty**

After finishing *The Kingdom of Copper*, I had to start the next one. This book is pretty chonky, running over 700 pages, so it will take me a little bit of time to get through but that doesn't bother me.

Finished:

**The Kingdom of Copper, by S. A. Chakraborty**

I liked this one even more than the first one in this trilogy (*The City of Brass*). Had to start the next one in the series after finishing. 4.5 stars.

Continuing:

**Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens**

Issue No. 20 (Chapters 44-46). Probably going to finish this one this week so I can start the next Dickens novel (*Barnaby Rudge*) this weekend.

**Middlemarch, by George Eliot**

Into Book VIII now and as the year wanes, we approach the end of the book. For the r/AYearOfMiddlemarch group.

**Royal Assassin, by Robin Hobb**

Another one that I'll probably finish up this week. Reading along with r/Bookclub and I'm really hoping they continue with the next one in the series, otherwise I'll just read it on my own.

**Georgics, by Virgil**

**So Thirsty, by Rachel Harrison.** (Audio) This was super fast-paced and fun! Hoping to pick up more from this author. 4 stars

**Filterworld: How Algorithms Flattened Culture, by Kyle Chayka**

My first non-fiction book in a long time. I mainly picked it, because i recently thought a lot about smartphones and the internet and how we use those things. I'm currently very dissatisfied with how everything works, and that there is no escape from this system, as it is so dominating and sourronding us 24/7. Although the book is far from perfect, it is a good read if you want to get a little inside view and a bit more understanding of algorithems and how we as humanity interact with it daily. I learned a lot about myself and how i want to use technology in the future.

A serialized novella. Villanelle is the code name of a female assassin. A sociopath who was arrested an tried and convicted of murder in Russia. She is freed from prison covertly and becomes an assassin for a shadowy neo fascist organization. She is purportedly dead and her identity discarded. She is trained by the organization to kill those that her masters direct her to.

In the second part she is identified as a female serial killer responsible for several murders and pursued by Eve, an agent for MI6, because she murders a highly visible Russian professor that Eve was tasked with protecting. Villanelle and Eve become aware of each other and it gets really weird. This story was  made into a TV show **Killing Eve**. The serialized novellas came later I understand. I'm not sure I will read further installments it really hasn't gripped my attention.  The next installment is apparently **Killing Eve, Die for me.**  Maybe I will finish it just to discover if dog food can be a valid substitute for brain matter in a forensic examination.

* Kelman is fantastic; highly recommend reading any of his work. I personally preferred *How Late It Was, How Late,* but this one eventually drew me in as well. I love his style - you're really thrown into the head of the POV character, and their thoughts feel fantastically real. He captures very human, lesser portrayed but deeply emotional experiences at a level I'd most associate with, for example, John Prine. Kelman's writing has a similar streak to some older country and Americana music. No surprise that that's very much his taste in music! And mine as well, so I quite enjoy his references.

**The Girl and the Mountain, by Mark Lawrence**

This is the second book of the *Book of the Ice* fantasy trilogy. In this story, the girl Yaz and her companions escape confinement two miles beneath an ice-bound planet, ascending to the surface only to be confronted by forces who wish to use her powers for conquest, control, and destruction. Despite this book being less than 400 pages, it's a very complex and challenging read with a large number of disparate characters and elaborate worldbuilding. The story combines elements of sci-fi, magic, mythology, horror and dystopia. Some of the settings, events and characters of this series also overlap with those of Lawrence's *Book of the Ancestor* series. While there's a lot of fascinating elements, my main criticism is of the literary sleight of hand that was employed to resolve several difficult (or impossible) dilemmas. I would have preferred more logical plot development.

Chain-Gang was excellent and singular. Cloud Atlas surprised me and I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot. Haunting of Hill House was good.

Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma, it was interesting to read it so many years after its info has seeped into pop culture so much more‚Äîthere is good stuff there even if the tone/audibook narration felt a bit too ‚Äòclever snarky.‚Äô And Steve Martin‚Äôs Object of Beauty, I had been given that and told it was a nonfiction book about the art world‚Äîshocked to open it up and it is a fiction story about the buying and selling of famous art works.

**Winter's Gifts by Ben Aaronovitch**: I'm starting to like these novellas featuring other characters from the Rivers of London world, they're a good way to explore more of the setting. I like how this one tackled native american mythology and how that would work in the urban mythology setting, it seemed fairly respectful. 

Currently reading (not from the library):  
**A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon**: Rereading this now that I have my own copy, and it's cemented my opinion that this book is even better than the first book. I love it so much. 

New books from the library:   
**Girl, Goddess, Queen by Bea Fitzgerald**: I like greek mythology retellings, and this one looks like a fun concept. That's really all there is to it!   
**Bookshops & Bonedust by Travis Baldree**: I liked the vibes of the first book a lot, but apparently not enough to pay money for it, so I got it from the library instead.  
**Redemptor by Jordan Ifueko** Another book that I apparently wasn't interested in enough to buy. The first book in this series was pretty cool and unusual, but I never got around to reading the sequel. I wonder how easy it will be to read given that it's been literal years since I read the first book.

**Fingersmith by Sarah Waters**: I've heard good things about this book, and the library is great for trying out authors you wouldn't normally read. It's good to have variety, I guess?",""

**Given Up For Dead: American POW's in the Nazi Concentration Camp at Berga, by Flint Whitlock**  
More about the battles (that read like a history textbook) that ended them up in the camp than I was expecting, but still pretty gripping, and gritty.

**Tuck Everlasting, by Natalie Babbitt**  
Read to my daughter. She cried at the end.

**Gay the Pray Away, by Natalie Naudus**  
A novel about a teen girl growing up in the cult of what's a barely-concealed version of the real-life IBLP (and its smarmy, creepy leader Bill Gothard, whom the book calls Ben Goddard). If you're not familiar with this world, you may think some of the things the author references are over-the-top, but if you know what the IBLP is like, you'll understand the author, who grew up in this group, is spot-on and nothing she writes about is fake.

**Do I Know You?: A Faceblind Reporter's Journey into the Science of Sight, Memory, and Imagination, by Sadie Dingfelder**  
I laughed my way through the first thirty pages or so, because everything the author wrote about being faceblind was so, so familiar. (Hello, not recognizing people I've known for years until they speak and I recognize their voice! So embarrassing.) An interesting look at the way the brain works - and doesn't, and how a huge amount of us out there are living and compensating in a world not designed for us.

**Running Out of Time, by Margaret Peterson Haddix**  
Also read with my daughter. Middle grade novel about a girl who learns she's been raised in a tourist exhibit where everyone believes it's 1840, but in the outside world, it's 1996. Kids are dying where she lives due to a diphtheria outbreak, and she's got to break out and navigate a world she doesn't understand to get help. Looking forward to reading the follow-up, Falling Out of Time.

Retelling of Noah and the ark. Did not like the formatting of dialogue and the raunchiness of it felt really odd considering the subject matter. Some decent character development but it takes a bit to get rolling. 2.5/5

**The Captive Prince by C.S. Pacat**

I was told this was a romance. There is no romance. There's a lot of slavery and assault, but no romance. The overall narrative is almost non-existent but finally picks up toward the end in a very predictable manner. I didn't like a single character in this book. Great prose, though, for such an otherwise forgettable story. 2/5

"lpmsou6","AnonymousCoward261","2024-09-30 11:13:33 UTC","**Conversations with Friends, Sally Rooney**

This was more entertaining than the other one (Normal People), if only because the infidelity made me feel like I was watching something naughty. I don't know why people say it's about polyamory, it seems more about revenge cheating to me.

It actually quite nicely sketches out the milieu of well-off (well, except for the protagonist) leftists in Irish literary society. They seem to care a lot about having the correct politics but don't seem to do much protesting or collective action or any of the things I expect activist-y people to do, just go on vacations with their rich friends and sleep with each other. Maybe that's Rooney making fun of her protagonists and, by extension, the people around her in real life?

The use of two characters' political stance drifting closer to foreshadow a romantic entanglement struck me as very Sally Rooney (from the two books of hers I've read), and really quite a clever touch. These ideas are important to these people, so *of course* if their ideas start to move closer it suggests they are too!

There's a nice line about having had an affair once preventing you from complaining when your partner does it. I could see both sides--yeah, it still hurts, and yeah, you're kind of hypocritical if you complain. Which of course was the point.

Did Bobbi and Melissa sleep together? I think they kissed but they seemed to like each other more and as they weren't really the viewpoint characters we don't know for sure how far they went. Frances was too obsessed with her romance with Nick to watch all of Bobbi's comings and goings, and it seemed to take Melissa and Bobbi a while to know for sure. Perhaps that's the point--it's suggested but not explicitly, showing that we never really know what our friends are up to.

I could see the Jane Austen comparisons--it is about the mores of a certain social class in a certain time. They're not trying to get married (and if they did, the results don't look great!) but that's accurate too. (The bit about Austen never portraying two men in conversation alone kind of fits too--after I read that, I realized Rooney has almost every other configuration, but not that one!)

The way Melissa pushes Nick around and demeans him was pretty familiar to me from my own experience, and reminded me of a reason I stay out of relationships these days. And I'm not even as good-looking as Nick!

>!I did like the ending--I doubt he's going back to her, but we don't really know, do we? And that's life--it doesn't make sense, it doesn't have neat literary arcs, it has no meaning and no closure, it just goes on. !<

Again, I'm sure I missed a whole bunch of stuff.

**How I Won A Nobel Prize, Julius Taranto**

(Read the second one as Tarantino originally? Yeah, I did too, which led to some funny expectations for the book when almost nobody actually died.)

Kind of a funny riff on the culture war, with a physicist trying to solve room temperature semiconducting at a place for people who have been cancelled. It's quite cleverly done, with the author dragging your sympathies one way and the other and making the story quite interesting. Wait, these are bad people, but she has the chance to solve room-temperature semiconducting! >!Wait, but she isn't going to do it! Wait, but she is! Wait, but the guy's going to steal it! Wait, but it doesn't matter!!<

He did the scientist protagonist pretty well, speaking as someone with a science background--I don't know if Taranto knows any physics, but I could at least believe his character did, which is what you expect from a novelist. I kind of feel like he swapped the expected genders on the protagonist and her boyfriend, probably to make her more sympathetic (at least to the conventional literary-fiction audience), and she didn't *quite* read like the nerd women I knew IRL...but it's hard to describe further. (I knew a few back in high school who tried to figure out if the relationships of their friends were a planar or nonplanar graph, for instance.)

I sort of feel like guys like Hew exist, and women like Helen exist, but *they wouldn't be dating each other*. Hew would run off with someone more in line with his political views, and Helen would wind up with a tech bro or someone she met in physics class. (Though Taranto tries to make it a little more credible by having him in IT.)

Anyway, I couldn't have done a better job. Fun book, I finished it in one reading (and stayed up late reading it, making me tired and grumpy for two days. I'm getting old.)",""

Oh these two and their antics with their infinite capacity to slack off. I mean there's plenty of stories I've seen with characters that fall under that classification, but what really ended up leaving a notable mark here was that their antics weren't just episodic things that happened in a vacuum so to speak. Things they did actually carried over to other chapters and were often brought up again. And with hilarious results in the way that it was done. Which really gave this story a kind of lived in feel, you know what I mean. Which, given the kind of story this is with the setup it had, is kinda saying something.

After that I started and then recently finished **The Elementals, by Michael McDowell** my first horror novel of Spooky Season. 2024. I didn't end up liking it as much as I thought would which kinda sucks, but it was still quite good. I was just left wanting more of an explanation of certain things. Author was very good at making me eventually like some rather unlikeable characters. Also did really well at creating an unsettling and strange atmosphere out of the mundane, I'd say kind of like everything was always slightly ""off"". Yet he also somehow managed to make some very fucking weird family relationships seems ""normal"" by the end. Good book, just was left wanting a bit on the horror side.

I've loved all of his John and Dave books, but wasn't sure what to expect from this one since it's a one-off story set in the real world, while his books are usually series with either paranormal or futuristic elements. After finishing it, I thought it was great and hit pretty close to home with regards to modern social isolation and the way social media encourages conflict and tribalism to maintain engagement. My only major criticism is that the book really struggled with dialogue in some places, with one major character basically losing all of of their characteristics and turning into an essay dispenser for about a tenth of the book. That seemed like a weird trap for Pargin to get stuck in given how many books he's already written that deliver complex perspectives without letting characters turn into essay writers, but I suppose he might be missing the days when he could write Cracked articles whenever an idea captured him.",""

**The Mercy of Gods, By James S.A. Corey**  
Non spoiler thoughts: If you love tragedy and ""weird"" sci-fi this will be right up your alley.  
Spoiler thoughts: >!The first act feels slow, only because it has to establish a baseline of 'normal' for our cast. After that it feels like a non-stop trauma filled, soul crushing exploration into what it means to be human and try to retain your humanity when your free will is taken away. The characters all grew on me, and by the end there wasn't a one that I could point to and say ""I didn't care for X"". They make some choices and take some actions that make me hate them sometimes, but given their circumstances I can totally understand why they did those things. Very, very good first entry for a series. I am super intrigued to read more when it comes out, so many interesting implications. Fair warning though, this book will make you want to shower your soul when you finish it.!<

**Lesser Evil, by Timothy Zahn**

A really good end to the Thrawn prequel series, with some solid resolution for nearly all characters involved. I hope there‚Äôs reason for Zahn to write more Thrawn in the future, but if not I can see myself returning to these and the other canon trilogy in the future.

**All Fours, by Miranda July**

What a weird, funny, very sexual book from start to finish. I enjoyed this, especially delivered with such a flippant, matter-of-fact tone. Like ‚Äúsure, this all may as well be happening, come live it with me‚Äù and that helped a lot here, for me.

**Woman Without Shame: Poems, by Sandra Cisneros**

Continuing to read a book of poetry each month this year, I found these to be probably the most vulnerable and proud collection I‚Äôve read this year. Going to have to request the library carry more of her older work, because I very much enjoyed this.

**Rejection: Fiction, by Tony Tulathimutte**

WOW, what an experience. Took this in as an audiobook, where each short story is read by a different narrator, and I think that adds a lot. Each story is written for characters so contemporarily real and frustrating that you can‚Äôt help but get sucked in to the strange final destination you reach at the end. Loved this a lot.

**Held, by Anne Michaels**

Getting to as many Booker longlist choices as I can, and I struggled to enjoy *Held*. I found it to be in love with itself and its own concept more than focused on delivering a coherent story. I think the story and chapter structures each prevented me from feeling too connected to the building ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù and I was deeply unsatisfied by the ending.

This was a weird one for me. Lots of danger but I couldn't like the main character. The protagonists were all awful in their ways, with some redemption at the end. The story didn't draw me in as they usually do, though I did enjoy reading it.  (I was feeling a bit down in the dumps, so that may have been a reason).

**How To Kill Men And Get Away With It by Katy Brent**

I really enjoyed this book, it had flavours of American Psycho, and I'd like to read more about the main character. There should be trigger warnings for sexual abuse though.

**Wild Horses by Dick Francis**

Back to enjoying these books. This had some likeable characters and the story was very interesting.

**Impossible Creatures, by Katherine Rundell** - A solid start to a new children's fantasy series though a lot darker than I was expecting.

There‚Äôs magic stuff and hints of what‚Äôs to come, but the story is way more focused on the three main characters and the love triangle. It‚Äôs more traditional ‚Äúkingdom and an evil monarch, how will the lead deal with the politics of the castle, oh a bit of magic stuff is happening‚Äù.


At the end of the second book, it just kind of kicks off massively, and book three seems to fully embrace the fantasy setting fully.

I read The Hot Zone and its 'sequel', Crisis in the Red Zone (preferred this one for improved accuracy and narrative of the heroes taken for granted). Both written by Richard Preston.","lpn1vtl"

It was a really interesting thought about who is ‚Äòallowed to/permitted to‚Äô write about what cultural topics. I found that interesting and also challenging to think about, reminding me of all my conscious and subconscious gender/racial/etc. biases. There is also a focus on someone navigating social media/online trolling/cancel culture that I thought was so spot on about what ‚Äòbeing online‚Äô is like‚Äîsort of like Patricia Lockwood‚Äôs No One Is Talking About This, but not wildly stream of conscious like that one is.

Ultimately I had to write that much in response I guess because I‚Äôm still thinking about Yellowface a lot. I really enjoyed it and I think I‚Äôd recommend.","lpu6uic"

At first I thought it was an editing error or something, lol, but yeah, I definitely agree that it was a way to distort or confuse the readers senses, so they could really empathise with the blind people in the novel. I found it really powerful (albeit a bit annoying at times as I sometimes lost track of who was speaking)

Oh God yes, the poop. There seemed to be quite a heavy message that losing one's sight can equate to the loss of one's humanity. It's quite jarring that simply not being able to see things also numbs feelings like shame and decorum.","lpnpzsc"

But no clutter, no excess.  Each word chosen with precision, with a kind of cool, deliberate intent.  It can feel stark, almost cold, at times.  But there's an honesty to it, a rawness.  It's a style that lays bare the essentials, the bones of the thing, without any softening or embellishment.  Like a winter tree, stripped of its leaves, you see its structure, its vulnerability, with a strange kind of clarity.  It's not for everyone, maybe.  But it has its own quiet beauty, its own way of getting under your skin.","lpq1nry"
