I must tell myself to become here and now into the pages I'm reading. If I can't stay focused it's usually because I'm not into it in general (some bookclub reads) or that part is slower.  

One thing I don't do is try to find a book ""like"" a book I just read. I want to give it the respect it deserves. I may stay in a similar genre, but I don't chase the vibes.
