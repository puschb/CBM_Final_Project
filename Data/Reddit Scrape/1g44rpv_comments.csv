"ls1hhi1","explicita_implicita","2024-10-15 14:11:48 UTC",">The middle grade book explores the “true story of the Indigenous Nations of the American Northeast, including the Wampanoag nation and others, and their history up to present day,” according to publisher Penguin Random House. Author Linda Coombs is a Wampanoag Tribe historian who has worked in the field for 50 years.

>“Colonization and the Wampanoag Story” is classified as nonfiction by the Library of Congress and Texas library systems, including those in Austin, Houston and Fort Worth. Despite this, the Montgomery County citizens review committee directed the book to be moved to the library’s fiction section by Oct. 17.

I do not think this was a book about creation myths. It's a kids story book that presents facts and information. from kirkus review:

>An Indigenous perspective on the impact of European settlement.

>Coombs (Aquinnah Wampanoag) uses two distinct voices to share information. The alternating chapters prefaced with “When Life Was Our Own” demonstrate the intergenerational sharing of knowledge about Wampanoag life based on oral traditions and research. Within these narratives, she teaches specific lessons: For example, readers learn how cedar was harvested with respect, “in a way that encouraged the growth of new saplings.” Later, they hear about how a sachem, or tribal leader, would resolve conflicts through a football game in order to avoid fighting. The voice of the remaining chapters “is inclusive of all tribal nations in southern New England,” covering history from the 1400s to the present. These chapters define and explore racism and provide facts about the devastating effects of the Europeans’ presence. Explorers’ 1524 arrival in present-day Rhode Island was followed by the Great Dying that wiped out entire Indigenous villages between 1616 and 1618. Europeans then proceeded to extract profits from natural resources, in contrast to Indigenous beliefs that “only the Creator who made the land could own it.” The epilogue describes the situation for Wampanoag people and other southern New England tribes in their territories today. Text boxes labeled “Let’s Think About This” pose critical thinking questions about the communities’ opposing viewpoints and engage readers. Black-and-white photos and artwork support the text. Together, the two intertwined narratives form a cohesive, engaging whole.

>A poignant and powerful look at identity, change, and resiliency. (bibliography, resources, image credits) (Nonfiction. 9-14)

Moving this to fiction seems to be an attempt to obfuscate the history of genocide and pillage and paint those as fiction.","ls1aebl"

Chapter 1 is, explicitly, historical fiction. It doesn't appear to be a passed down oral tale but just a short story someone in recent times wrote that is meant to illustrate pre-contact life. The portions I read weren't mystical at all. They don't present it as anything but a fictional tale meant to illustrate the time. Chapter 2 reads, conversely, is non-fiction.","ls1aebl"
"ls49091","Solesaver","2024-10-15 23:12:27 UTC","I don't think mystical elements would disqualify something from being non-fiction. Plenty of non-fiction historical accounts contain unverified information. What makes it non-fiction is whether or not it is ""made up,"" so to speak. That is, did the text of the book come from the author's imagination? Or is it a good faith recounting of information from some other sources.

As an example, a good faith translation of The Illiad by Homer would be non-fiction. Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller would be fiction. The Illiad may or may not be the product of Homer's imagination (ok, it definitely is), but a the book on the shelf is clearly an accurate recounting of Homer's epic tale. Song of Achilles, on the other hand is the product of the author's imagination set during the events of Homer's Iliad.

IMO, a good faith effort to record indigenous folk stories and oral traditions is non-fiction. The author isn't saying ""these stories are true;"" they're saying ""these are truly the stories that are told.""","ls1aebl"

[Here's a 2023 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/16pxsqg/its_2023_we_gotta_scrap_the_dewey_decimal_system/), but the biggest reasons are exactly issues like this and inherently prejudicial categorization. (Although the inherent prejudice seems to mostly correspond with availability of material in a subject at a given time. For instance, I'd *expect* the computer programming section to all lump under on specific number with about 10 digits after the decimal. Like 180% of floor space in libraries is dedicated to fiction.)

Before anyone starts says ""Yeah! It's time!"" there is a HUGE financial and time commitment - the sheer number of libraries that would have to be re-catalogued is just one piece. Also consider the political/social blowback over ""how it's always been done/it works as is/tradition"". (This is similar to the metric/imperial system debate.) Libraries are at the mercy of political whims. Dewey is just awful for discovery, but I'm not sure that I understand how it affects discovery in any *functional* way, just perceptual. Considering that most of material is discovered via modern searching setups (phones and desktops mostly maybe?), the umpteen numbers and letters after a decimal don't really matter to the general schmo looking through topics. Unless the library has a conspicuously small section dedicated to a subject - but librarians are always quick to tell you that's due to lack of interest more than the lack of material available, and they all fight for floor space eventually. Having augmented reality that you can look at the stacks with your phone/camera is probably the future... one day.

For now we still have libraries that only got a digital catalogue within the last decade, which is amazing to think about, and there are probably libraries out there that only have a card catalog.","ls1w1df"

"ls321ev","thatbob","2024-10-15 19:12:47 UTC","Right, and much confusion comes from calling our Not Monographic General Fiction sections of the library ""non-fiction,"" when what they are is ""classified literature"" sections.  Thus, creative works like poetry, plays, graphic novels, and art books wind up in ""non-fiction"" with the aforementioned Religion, Folktales, and other topics that are of dubious verifiability.  Which can be confusing.  

We don't really have ""Fiction"" and ""Non-Fiction"" sections, so much as we have ""Classified Literature"" and ""Unclassified  General Fiction"".

None of which seems relevant to the situation at hand, which was NOT a compendium of indigenous folk tales, but an actual historical treatment (aimed at juveniles) by an actual indigenous historian. WTF, citizen oversight board?","ls29bkz"

"ls33qck","thatbob","2024-10-15 19:21:44 UTC","No, in many libraries, Beowulf is shelved in Non-Fiction because it is a poem.  (Or, more precisely, because it's not unclassified general monographic fiction.)  For example, in LoC, it's PR (English Literature) 1580 (Beowulf texts) or 1583 (modern language translations of Beowulf texts).  And something similar in Dewey.  

If this is confusing, that's because our ""non-fiction"" sections aren't actually non-fiction.  [They're actually ""classified literature"" sections, in settings where Fiction is unclassified.](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g44rpv/houstonarea_library_moves_indigenous_history_book/ls321ev/)

Another way to look as it is this: both LC and Dewey *do include* ways to shelve general monographic fiction within their systems.  But most general and public libraries don't use them, because it basically places a huge Fiction section right in the middle of your ""everything else"" section, separates authors into nations of origin, and does other things that make it harder to find a book by shelf browsing.  That's why a better way to think of our ""non-fiction"" sections is as ""stuff that shelves nicely by LC or Dewey"" and our ""Fiction"" section is ""the one thing that's just easier to shelve by author's last name.""","ls1wj0x"
"ls38mj7","joeallisonwrites","2024-10-15 19:47:28 UTC","This is at the whims of the librarians - in my library, this falls squarely under ""classic literature"", so it's in fiction that would be taught in colleges in high schools alongside other equivalent stuff. Assuming it's there at all, since... it's freely available and kids have it in their textbooks. Critical analysis, etc is elsewhere. The exception here would be textbooks or anthologies, which is where you're truly likely to see Beowulf - and it will be annotated with critical notes alongside other works, so therefore non-fiction.

Melvil Dewey got cancelled out of his organization in *1906*, I want you to think how far this man had to go and take it so that people in 1906 went out and said ""hey now, men should not feel entitled to a woman like that"". Just think about what things were constantly let slide back before 2017 that would not be cool now. Think about how bad it was in the 1970s when women were barely entering the workforce and the idea of equality was just becoming mainstream. Think about how bad it was in the 1950s, where movies and stories constantly normalized and even celebrated abusive relationships and older men with way to young women.

And yet here was this guy canceled **14 years before women suffrage was effective nationwide**. In a time where women weren't allowed to vote, people got away with rape and marrying children, where influential and powerful people got away with things that would make Trump blush. Somehow *this guy got canceled from his own organization*, I mean good on them for enforcing this when they could, but you also have to wonder: just how much did this guy do that he was able to get people to agree with the ladies on that era? This guy was settling harrasment suits in the 1930s, this was a proflific, abusive, and out of control sexual abuser; anything less and we wouldn't be hearing this much about it.","ls35sqp"

"ls5an15","godisanelectricolive","2024-10-16 03:14:25 UTC","A big reason why there are so many female librarians is because he insisted that the first library school which he founded at Columbia accept women, against the wishes of the university’s regents. 17 out of the first 20 students were women because Dewey wanted female students to sexually harass. He specifically asked all applicants to submit a picture so he can only admit women he found attractive. There was also rumour that he asked for bust sizes of prospective students but that was proven to be false. He also hired some of his students to be his personal assistants once they graduated and sexually assaulted them repeatedly.

However, his wish to admit mostly women to the newly burgeoning profession was realized and had a huge impact on the demographics of librarianship to this day. Actually, it was probably his combination of his perverted nature and mentorship that became his downfall. Because the profession had so many women, the ALA had women in its leadership position after just over a dozen years after the first library school and the leaders of the organization rallied together against their mutual sexual harasser and former professor. This was personal for them, for years they put up with his horrible behaviour and they’ve finally had enough. 

Dewey was ostracized by the ALA because he sexual harassed four prominent and respected female librarians who reported him to the Association. The leadership was sympathetic because there were women in decision making positions. In 1915 the president of the ALA Mary Wright Plummer and a student of Dewey’s first class at Columbia pronounced Dewey to be persona non grata and refused to meet him ever again. It really goes to show the resilience of the first generation of female librarians, what they had to put up with to get into one of the few professions that welcomed women and then work their way up the hierarchy enough to stand up to the man who had control over them for so long.  

Outside of his own organization he had a little more leeway but even so, he had to pay $2000 to settle a sexual harassment suit in 1930 at age 79 to his secretary at the winter sports club he was the president of and founded. This was Lake Placid Club which was super racist and later hosted the 1932 Winter Olympics. From what I’ve read about him, Dewey didn’t even bother to harass women behind doors. He frequently catcalled, touched and kissed women without permission and he did all the time. And even his male colleagues all hated him, he was a temperamental, demanding control freak who was deeply unpleasant to work with or work for. People who knew him strongly disliked him so they didn’t try very hard to protect him.","ls3pbbf"
