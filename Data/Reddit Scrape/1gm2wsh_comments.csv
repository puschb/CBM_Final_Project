Can more school book bans and restrictions be expected? I’d say that’s fair to expect. That trend has been increasing and I imagine will be emboldened when he does come to power. There’s also some concern about libraries in some states. 

But I don’t believe we’ve reached or neared the point where what you’ve proposed is necessary. It would take substantial steps and changes for an administration to do so. I also don’t believe what you’ve asked for is possible due to how publishers, rights, and other factors work. 

To be fair, I could see concern for some works in the future. For example, Project 2025 does propose expansions to what’s considered ‘pornography’ and restrictions on such. Which wouldn’t just take off anything with spice in it (or possibly anything with ideas about sex, sexuality, challenging ideas about it, etc) off the shelves, but based on the language; I’d suspect anything including LGBTQ+ people, ideas, voices, etc. 

“Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children, for instance, is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to First Amendment protection.

“Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime.”

“The Department of Education (the depart-ment, or ED), discussed by Lindsey Burke in Chapter 11, is a creation of the Jimmy Carter Administration. The department is a convenient one-stop shop for the woke education cartel, which-as the COVID era showed— is not particularly concerned with children’s education. Schools should be responsive to parents, rather than to leftist advocates intent on indoctrination-and the more the federal government is involved in education, the less responsive to parents the public schools will be.
This department is an example of federal intrusion into a traditionally state and local realm. For the sake of American children, Congress should shutter it and return control of education to the states.” p. 285

“The next President should issue a series of executive orders requiring: An accounting of how federal programs/grants spread DEI/CRT/ gender ideology, The release of a report to Congress on how to consolidate the department and trim nonessential employees, A report on the negative influence of action civics on students’ understanding of history and civics and their disposition toward the United States…(in order to receive funding.”) p. 390

While it's true many books haven't been outright banned, many have been made more DIFFICULT to access. And today more than ever people live in much smaller bubbles and if it's not widely available, they may not even know it exists.

The level of education has been plummeting in many states since the Reagan era (arguably by design) which has contributed to far more low-info voters in the U.S., and making ""challenging"" books harder to access certainly won't help that trend.

Worrying about the ease of access to information isn't just about political fearmongering, it's also something that should already be a concern in an era where more and more physical media is going strictly digital. So there's a multi pronged attack here.","lvzjaqs"

Schools and libraries are the primary customers for textbooks, so if you want to curtail specific ideas or theories, this is in fact preferable to a full ban, because you're essentially killing the market for textbooks with certain types of content, ensuring that you don't even *need* to censor anything, because nobody will dare produce anything worthy of being censored to begin with.

We must attend school. It's compulsory. So schools need to exist in the state. State governments must establish school libraries but have no requirement to establish or maintain public libraries unless they enacted library standards themselves.
