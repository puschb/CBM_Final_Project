"lvkij6j","RoundComplete9333","2024-11-05 19:05:24 UTC","I’ve always said, “Reading nonfiction gives you knowledge, but reading fiction gives you wisdom.”

My mother was an English teacher who taught Shakespeare and Chaucer and Poe and Mark Twain among the many other great authors. She instilled into me and my siblings the love of reading fiction. She would often use stories to teach us life lessons rather than just tell us what to do because that was what was to be expected of us. 

It’s almost too easy to tell if a person loves to read literature. Reading literature shapes a person.",""

Exasperated, the ranger said: ""It's because y'all don't read a book!""

I think about that a lot.",""
"lvm3oqs","dmillson","2024-11-05 23:54:16 UTC","Sorry this comment ended up being long. 

I’ve been talking with my partner (ranting, really) lately about the importance of encouraging curiosity and critical thinking in schools. I give a lot of credit to the teachers and professors who gave me open-ended assignments that made me ask my own questions and find answers to them. Real life seldom requires you to memorize and recite facts; it asks you to gather and synthesize information, to decide what’s important and what isn’t. 

Bringing it back to books, I remember an English teacher I had whose assignment each time we finished a book was “write an essay.” There was no topic or page limit, we were simply challenged to communicate what we took away from the book. That’s exactly how reading fiction *should* be - maybe without the writing assignment, but we at least should be thinking deeply about what we read. 

Or when reading non-fiction, it’s an interesting exercise to put books into conversation with each other. Do different authors agree or disagree? Where do I stand as the reader? 

At this point it is practically our civic duty to practice our critical thinking. We consume so much short-form content that is entirely devoid of substance and we need to be able to find the substance when we needed. One example would be the amount of scientific studies that get touted as “breakthroughs” on social media. Read the comments and you’ll see that many people fail to understand that (1) most of these studies aren’t as big an advancement as advertised, and (2) most will never translate to an approved drug. Therefore, many people mistakenly believe that there is a conspiracy to suppress scientific progress for the benefit of pharmaceutical companies.

Or to get political for a moment, if you look at the US presidential election, most reporting has reduced the two (mainstream) candidates’ campaigns to a couple of key issues: Kamala = reproductive rights and democracy; Trump = economy and immigration. The candidates do indeed focus on these issues, but the way it gets reported is oversimplified and strips away the substance of the candidates’ platforms. If your #1 issue as a voter is X, then you owe it to yourself to actually look into both candidates proposed policies on X and the likely implications. Don’t just vote for a candidate because they market themselves as being best for X; once you take an honest look at their proposals, you may think otherwise.",""

People read for a variety of reasons - I will freely admit that the #1 reason I read is for enjoyment (other factors like improving knowledge, better understanding the world and my myself, etc. do matter, but for me they're secondary considerations).  Regardless of a reader's objectives, it's pretty normal to get wrapped up in a book and not want to put it down.

Having an amount of knowledge is what actually allows us to engage with complex systems in the world in an informed way. People underestimate the power of memorizing facts about your government or other civic institutions. Also, you should have knowledge of history, including dates, places, names, because this is what builds up your ability to comprehend arguments people make in a misinfo landscape but also just generally in conversation or when other facts come up you can compare your knowledge to it. You make connections that you otherwise wouldn't have, it opens your mind to more possible correct views of the world around you.

"lvvt4ci","kAFKaEsk6","2024-11-07 12:01:01 UTC","one insight i would like to add is that, books are portals.

humans grow and evolve as we age, yes, but only so much within the confines of the space and culture we inhabit, only so much as the people that influence us. but readings books expand our horizons without having to physically transport ourselves from where we are, without having to meet and get to know new people.

it immerses us in experience and ideas we would otherwise not have, and we come out having the wisdom and insight to bolster ourselves in navigating the little space which life gave us.

my emotional aptitude and confidence did not come from my parents, who raised me full of insecurity and shame. they come from wonderful characters i read in books.

my worldview, my optimism, even my moral compass, a lot of what makes me ""me"" were influenced by the books i read. these pages on paper had more influence on me than the people in my life. 

and adding up as to why dictators burn literature, it's because it may show the people a different way of life, a better way of living. and the idea that life could be better sows discontent, which disturbs the absolute power of tyrants.",""

The entire post was a treat, but I also enjoyed your last paragraph:

>There is a reason that the dictators always burn and ban literature. When people read literature, they encounter the human experience in a uniquely intimate way. The reader envisions what it is like to be inside another body, since the language within a book emerged from within another body, the author's body.

Most people don’t know how to read, because they read. They scroll and read titles, abstract and conclusions, etc.

But they do not understand what they are reading when they dig deeper.

They do not understand the methods, nor the statistical analysis, or able to follow process and flows, for policies.

Part of this is because the way they are written is deliberately obfuscated, a drug clinical study for example the Pfizer vaccine trials was how many pages and if you don’t know what you’re looking for, you will be fooled it is 95% effective.

No questions asked about what is effective and how is the 95% calculated.

Because those things are deliberately complex and require reading other papers to understand things like absolute vs relative risk.

So if someone has not gotten to being able to talk deeply about AR vs RR and even statistical significance or how experimental designs work, going back to guys like Ronald Fisher, they really have no business talking about vaccines.

But everyone had an opinion on the thing, the liberals and conservatives vote for or against the thing and nobody can explain the thing.

This happens to well educated PhD level people who when questioned go “I will hand off my thinking to the argument of authority and go off peer review because it’s not my field”.

Then why do you have an opinion on it if all you’re able to do is point to some vague hand wavy review process?

Reading is the fundamental part to this process but make sure you understand what you are reading for yourself.","lvm3oqs"

I absolutely enjoy reading, but it is not easy for me to get through a book because I grew up with my face in a GameBoy and then a GBA and then a DS and laptop while TV played in the background.  I didn't have the foresight as a kid to know that this was cooking my attention span and ability to focus and ""mono-task.""

Books often humanize the people that an authoritarian seeks to dehumanize for whatever reason. A basic example: an anti-gay authoritarian not wanting kids to read narratives about gay people. Whether the authoritarian would use the word empathy in their reasoning doesn't matter. They are actively trying to crush children's ability to empathize with and understand gay people. The dictator, like you say, wants to control the narrative and villainize this particular group of people.

I do agree with you on the fact that someone who 'listens to podcasts, goes to the opera and theater, watches educational documentaries, and watches the news' can be much more well-informed than someone who reads. However, if you have any dataset that allows you to do this, you can check the correlation between people who 'listen to podcasts, go to the opera and theater, watch educational documentaries, and watch the news' and people who read diversely. I have a hunch that it would be highly positive.

At this point we are kind of just arguing whether reading is a necessary or sufficient condition for smartness. Your point is it is neither which is that neither does reading necessarily make you smart nor is it that it is sufficient for someone to read to be called smart.

>Profile Analysis: Indicators of a Right-Wing Orientation for user us1838015

>Frequent Mentions of “Trump”: The user mentions the word “trump” 24 times, suggesting a significant preoccupation with topics related to the former president. While this alone does not confirm support, it does indicate that Trump is a key figure in their discussions, potentially reflecting alignment with or defense of Trump's policies and viewpoints.

>Engagement with Political Discourse:

>Words like “vote,” “voters,” “republicans,” and “states”: These terms suggest an active engagement with the political process, potentially from a conservative or right-leaning perspective, especially if discussions revolve around defending traditional values or promoting Republican policies.

>Mentions of “laws,” “tariffs,” and “police”: These terms are often associated with right-wing rhetoric focusing on law and order, economic protectionism, and a strong stance on national security, themes commonly endorsed by Trump and his supporters.

>Interest in r/JoeRogan: The user’s activity in the r/JoeRogan subreddit could imply an openness to or agreement with libertarian and conservative viewpoints. Joe Rogan’s podcast is known for attracting a mixed audience, including many who are critical of mainstream media and leftist policies, and often sympathetic to right-wing arguments.

>Use of Language Indicative of Right-Wing Concerns:

>Terms like “rhetoric,” “violence,” “police,” and “service” are frequently used in discussions about maintaining social order and addressing perceived liberal overreach, aligning with right-wing narratives.

>Mentioning “tariffs” suggests an interest in economic nationalism, a hallmark of Trump’s economic policy aimed at protecting American jobs and industries.

>Focus on “State” and “Public”: A strong emphasis on issues related to state governance and public services might reflect a concern for state sovereignty and a preference for decentralized governance, principles often aligned with conservative ideology.

>Conclusion:

>Based on selective interpretation of their frequent references to Trump, participation in discussions related to law and order, economic policies like tariffs, and engagement in communities with right-leaning discourse (like r/JoeRogan), us1838015 could be characterized as having a right-wing or Trump-supportive stance. Their active participation in political and social debates, often touching on themes central to conservative values, further strengthens this alignment.

None of his policies or rhetoric is favorable for independently minded women (I assume these are your _western women_—cringe)

Also, I think independently minded women would be more included to vote for the candidate more likely to give them bodily autonomy and equal pay, PLUS SHE HAS A VAGINA

"lw7c5pl","Passenger_Available","2024-11-09 04:42:03 UTC","Ok when I dumped your info into the AI, it said you leaned socially libertarian and economically left.

However your raw data showed you talk about trump a lot, meaning you do not like the guy.

I forced the AI to cherry pick and spin the summary to say you’re a trump lover because that psychology usually works to get folks to see what they’re doing is nothing more than just being one side of the same coin.

It’s like holding up a mirror to them.

Plus you seemed fun and I like poking fun at people I like.

But I couldn’t care less about the actual politics.

It’s research for me.

I come on Reddit to study, throw out knowledge I have to offer every now and then. But mainly my interactions with people here is a testing ground for me.

I did the same across LinkedIn, Twitter and now here.

I read books on social intelligence, psychology and test things out.

I run ads, make tweets, posts, comments, send messages, etc and observe human behavior.

My work really is in the AI space, but in a cross disciplinary way.

The mentality around belief systems is important to understand, so overtime I’ve learnt how to detect them, what words and patterns of behaviors they display, and how I can get a predicted effect.

For example.

You can predict a downvote or upvote from similar comments but in different communities. On Facebook you can predict a reaction from specific people. Here you can predict blocks, or a tantrum, etc.

You are an anomaly.

I’m not sure if you didn’t block me because I told you to do so. But so far it happened a few times on different accounts where I riled them up, then told them that they would usually block me by now when it’s getting close to that point. Then they didn’t. Some just stopped responding.

What I ensure I do not do though is to cause significant mental distress on others that can have a negative impact on their health. Yes it will cause discomfort because challenging beliefs is uncomfortable but that is as far as it goes.

When my test is done I shut it down.

Sometimes I come out with friends, such as on Facebook I made a wonderful photobiologist friend.

On LinkedIn a brilliant software engineer with cross disciplinary knowledge in biophysics. A few women even visited me in my country.

On my other Reddit accounts, which I need to log into because one guy messaged me privately asking questions and seemed sad I said I won’t login back in for awhile.

Every platform has a persona that works for it. Same person, different behavior, different response.

Take nothing personally.","lw71094"
