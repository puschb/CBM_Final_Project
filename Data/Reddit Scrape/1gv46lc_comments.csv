"lxyz3jc","der_titan","2024-11-19 18:54:23 UTC","The best historical fiction I've ever read is the Master and Commander series by Patrick O'Brian. It's centered around an intelligence agent and British naval officer during the Napoleonic Wars, and the series spans 20 completed novels in locales that range across the globe. It's meticulously researched, explores friendship and war in a way that I find unparalleled.

The 21st was released, unfinished, after the author's death. I read it once, but every subsequent circumnavigation of the series I feel oddly happy with the ending of the 20th book: Jack and Stephen setting course for the Strait of Magellan with the entire world before them.

There are unresolved plotlines, but such is life. This is the same series that killed off a well-loved character in the 19th book, with a single line in the midst of a 3 page battle, and his death rarely referenced explicitly by any of the remaining characters. Life goes on, as Aubrey and Maturin perpetually are off on their next adventure.",""

"lxzvk4f","iwannasendapackage","2024-11-19 21:37:47 UTC","Back in high school, I got way into Tolkien. I'm still a big fan. I was on track to being a fantasy nerd. I had plenty of people recommending that I watch Game of Thrones, but being me I didn't want to watch it before I read the book, and I didn't want to read the series until it was finished. Obviously I never got around to consuming George R. R. Martin's work. 

And, looking back, I think that was a big factor in turning me off of fantasy as a whole. I still like Tolkien, but I never got around to expanding my horizons in the genre, because what felt like the obvious next step was something that I didn't want to start if it wasn't going to be finished. My taste still developing, I found enjoyment elsewhere, and left fantasy behind almost entirely.

Let me tell you a little about SNIFF: Book 1 of The SNIFF, SMOKE, SHOOT Series weaves a gripping tale of love and human connection amidst a world of crime and high-stakes tension. While packed with intense action and suspense, the heart of the story lies in the complexities of relationships and the loyalty that binds them.

David's unbreakable connection with Kennedy shapes his every move, as he fights for redemption while navigating the shadows of his gritty past. Their bond is relentlessly tested by betrayal, hidden truths, and the constant danger closing in around them, showcasing the lengths David will go to protect the woman he loves.

This novel delves into the interplay of love, trust, and survival, illustrating how relationships endure even under the weight of life-or-death circumstances. More than just a high-octane thriller, SNIFF is a compelling exploration of the strength and resilience of the human spirit when love is on the line.

I get how people want *something* - it's a coping mechanism.  But in the end, the hand holding the pen wasn't Jordan's, and nothing can change that.  
  
What we got was *almost* an ending.  An ending that might have been.  A paraphrase of the actual ending.  It might be good- it might even be very good.  But at best, we get to imagine what the real ending was and hope that Sanderson's ending was close enough.  
  
It's Splenda in The Wheel of Time's iced tea.  Sweeter than sugar but nowhere near as satisfying.  
  
Personally, I think it's wrong to ever finish series like this.  Even the humblest of pinch-hitter authors is by definition attempting to do as good as the original author.  They mean well.  They want to honor the legacy of the original author.  But in the end, there will always be an element of hubris.  And the mere fact that the work is meant to be published and sold sullies the effort- even if it were ONLY about honoring the legacy of the original author and wishing to wrap up a beloved story.  
  
Sanderson did it as ""right"" as it's possible to do.  He understood and stayed true the source material.  He did his best to use Jordan's ""voice.""  And he openly states that he ISN'T Robert Jordan and wasn't trying to be.  And honestly, I admire him for that.  But the Wheel of Time deserved better, and I'm disappointed in him for ever thinking he should have tried finishing it.  
  
That stated, if someone wants to read the so-called ""ending"" of Wheel of Time, I'm all for it.  I won't ever agree that statement that what they read IS the ending of the Wheel of Time, though.","ly0uv9p"

If someone hasn't published a new book in a series in a fair few years (exact # depends on authors prior publishing history) then you can generally consider it abandoned and assume it will never be finished. Theres a slim possibility they might publish another, I've def seen some sequels released more than a decade later (several decades even), but at that point the sales #'s have absolutely nothing to do with why the sequel happened.

I think this plays into the biggest factor the books won't finish, I don't think Martin really has any interest in writing Epic Fantasy/High Fantasy, but he structured his story to build up to becoming that.

I have read one of Martin's inspirations was the Great Game in the Wheel of Time series, which was a very minor sort of filler sub-plot about political intrigue within an epic high fantasy story. My take is Martin thought the concept of 'normal' people and politics within an epic prophecy plot playing out deserved to be fleshed out, but now that he's out of that 'phase' and getting to the actual epic fantasy parts he has just lost interest.","lxzthz8"

I loved the first few seasons of Disenchantment and Umbrella Academy. Both shows suffered in the last seasons and I have lost the ability to enjoy the first seasons knowing it all ends so badly.

From what I understand, GRRM intended to do a time jump after Storm of Swords, but walked that back and tried to bridge the gap with Feast and Dance; I think if he'd executed that jump the series would have more distinctive chunks like the one I see in the first three books.","lygti32"

And I agree. People should still watch the show and read the book. The show was some of the best TV of all time up until about season 5, and the books are all brilliant, even if the story never gets finished.","ly19zme"

This is just stupid. I literally quoted and bolded the part of my initial message that I expressly wrote to account for issues that people had after **seasons 4, 5 or 7 (based on who you ask)**, that are separate from the endding. It's literally right there in my original post. 

Saying I'm backpedalling is demonstrably false, stupid, and disingenuous. Thank you for showing exactly why I had no intention of being dragged into this sort of black hole again. Ridiculous.","ly2q45s"

Posting what you quoted and bolded doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you claimed it was the shows ending that most people had a problem with, which you are conveniently ignoring in all your reply‚Äôs. And you also said episodes, not seasons, in your original post, so stop acting like you made it so clear when you can‚Äôt even get it right lol.","ly3kv49"
