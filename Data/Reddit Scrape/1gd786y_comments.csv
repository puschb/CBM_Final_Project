I see a physical book as a two part purchase - the price I pay for the experience of reading the book, and the price I pay for the material asset that I can shelve for display, loan to friends etc.

A Kindle book is only one part of that package, and IMO should cost less as a result.

And that's purely from a consumer pov - it makes even less sense to charge more for a digital product than the physical equivalent when one has a per-unit manufacturing cost and the other does not.",""

"ltzis9o","Teppiest","2024-10-27 09:48:27 UTC","Unfortunately I'm at a point where I have to use digital books for everything as a form of preservation. I don't really get a choice in buying physical or digital in most cases, it all has to be digital.

The reason why is related to two major events in my life.

My Grandmother was an avid reader and had spent her entire life collecting books. She bought a house and had a dedicated room that was effectively a personal library of all the books she'd bought over her entire life. Eventually life got hard and she had to sell the house to be closer to family. Having to downsize her collection was incredibly hard for her and left a pretty core memory behind of the reality that I may not be able to keep my collection with me my whole life. Then after she moved the place she was staying on had a really bad leak, and absolutely soaked through a couple stacks of boxes from her collection before she noticed. Those had to get dumped and again it was another nightmare where the loss felt very heavy even for me who was still a kid at the time. Then by the time she had gotten too old to take care of herself she had to go to a home, and none of her collection went with her. The remainder was just a burden on the family as they donated what they could, and whatever the library wasn't interested in taking just got unceremoniously sent to the dump.

As an adult I moved in with a friend who was living with her family. My friends Grandmother was also an avid reader and had a massive library in a dedicated room just like my Grandma did. I fell in love with her collection and unlike my Grandmother who liked crime and romance, (Which weren't my scene as a child) my friends Grandmother was loaded with Sci-Fi and Fantasy. I was able to romanticize the idea of a library again. I love books.

Unfortunately dementia started to take her Grandmother and over time those books became projectile weapons in heated moments of confusion. Bookshelves started getting ripped down in psychotic breakdowns that threatened not only others, but our cat and herself as well. At first it was a matter of downsizing the library and putting it into the garage to reduce the risk of injury, leaving only her favorites out in a small shelf. But then as the disease progressed, she lost interest in books entirely. Even as potential weapons. Then after she passed it became the struggle of trying to remove the collection. Lots more went to donations than my Grandmother's collection did this time around, which was nice to see. But overall, it was just a burden for everyone around.

So for me digital books are the way to go. I love the idea of having a library. But after seeing this story play out twice I can't bring myself to get attached to such a large volume of books that I'll someday have to deal with the pain of losing like that. I have a small collection of books in physical, my personal favorites, that are in a very small shelf in my room. About hip-high. And that's good enough for me. 

So yeah, to answer your question getting books digitally for me is the only way. Even if it costs more.",""

"lu0oy86","DJB7103","2024-10-27 15:15:47 UTC","One other caviat about E books i haven't heard anyone mention here, and this goes for E books, and or  games u download as opposed to buy such as playstation or xbox digital copies and of course DVD blue ray vs stream or buying a movie through an app.
Basically, read the fine print , you technically don't even own them!! This isn't an exaggeration or a joke , they can be actually removed from ur library if the domain such as Kindle or HBo max or whatever stops having rights to sell them ,eg. Company sells itself  or simply a contract to sell the product runs out, it will be removed from ur library. Not all companies, in fact, most will not automatically feel bad and give u a credit for something else, sometimes you just lose out. This is 100% true and un - debatable however most people are completely unaware of this. It has happened to me with YouTube movies and also with PlayStation,  and it can happen with Kindle and Audible  as well.

\\* Should be significantly cheaper aka discount of the physical book.

\\* digital on iPad is portable and takes up zero space so is preferable imho.

Exceptions are some old books which one finds in second hand book shops which are cheaper and not found online for example.

If the digital edition is more expensive it is not worth purchasing imho. The whole point of digital is discount version of the physical book which if really useful or quality then people will pay more for to have convenience of physical edition as part of their homes on bookshelves.",""

When the cover price of a book is $20 and the ebook is $15 but Amazon is selling the paperback for $10, it is not the publisher setting that price. Publishers control the price of ebooks. They go on sale sometimes, but mostly are a static price. Paperbacks, on the other hand, once Amazon gets them, they can price however they want. Going to other storefronts that sell both physical and ebooks you will notice that unless the physical book is on special, physical books are always more expensive or at the very least the same price. 

Just a fun example because book 5 is coming out soon. On Barnes & Noble, The Way of Kings paperback is $25.99 while the ebook is $8. On Amazon, The Way of Kings paperback is $15.49 while the ebook is also still $7.99. By contrast, The Last Graduate by Naomi Novik is $18 for a paperback on B&N and $9.77 for that same paperback on Amazon, despite the ebook for both storefronts being $12.99.

I am an avid reader and can honestly say I have NEVER seen an ebook that cost more than the paper version. If you have, you should be angry, because the production of the ebook cost a tiny fraction of what a physical book costs.

Use libraries: Get Libby and add all libraries you belong to. Borrow books to save money. Newer books may have long wait times than older books. 

On Amazon sign up for Kindle rewards. Keep your eye out for rare double and triple reward days - I go through my wishlist to see what books are currently on huge sales (50-80% off/lowest price in 30 days) to combine with the double/triple rewards days.

If using Amazon Prime sometimes you can select a slightly later delivery date and get digital rewards to use towards kindle books

I‚Äôve signed up for newsletters by favorite authors to keep up with new releases and sales - many of these resources include sales for multiple retailers

Favorite Genres: BookBub let‚Äôs you follow certain genres/sub-genres as well as a few specific ‚Äúspecial interest‚Äù and will send you new releases and sales/freebies on a daily or weekly basis - your choice (includes multiple retailers). Amazon also has genre, and other more general, newsletters you can sign up for . You can check out daily sales from Kindle ebooks

So, once ebooks became a thing, the already existing tax exemption couldn‚Äôt be extended to cover them, from a legal perspective.

"lu0kqko","typo180","2024-10-27 14:52:05 UTC","It depends on how elastic the demand is and how deep the market is.¬†

If it's a new and highly anticipated book, you're probably going to get plenty of sales whether it's priced at $17.99 or $9.99. Lowering the price is just throwing money away.¬†

Especially because a lot of the people who decline to buy the book at $17.99 will end up buying it later when you drop the price.¬†

Similarly, I'd demand is a fairly steady trickle (maybe it's a niche book or most of the fans have already read it), lowering the price isn't going to increase demand much because you only have a handful of people interested at any given point regardless of the price. If you're going to lower the price, you want to make sure you're going to make up the reduced per-book profit loss in volume.¬†

And you'll never really get to a point where the cost of storing a digital book is more than the loss you'll take by selling it for less than you paid for it because the incremental cost of having one more ebook is basically nothing.¬†

They still do drop the price periodically to see if they can generate some extra income (I'm sure Amazon has a system for deciding when to do this), but it's not a matter of making room for other inventory.¬†","ltzq744"

In IT for a publisher/distributor or just generally in IT? I‚Äôm in ‚ÄúIT‚Äù and that doesn‚Äôt give me special insight into how the publishing process works. 

> who says that functionally the files are copy/paste. Thats why sometimes you see errors (spelling, grammar, etc) in ebooks and not print. Because they actually get QC checked in print, but not e-book format. 

It sounds like you‚Äôre saying the files are essentially identical, but then saying that they‚Äôre not. Which is it? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some amount of work that has to be done to handle layout/formatting for each medium. 

But none of that really matters for my point. I don‚Äôt think producing an epub file makes up a significant portion of the cost of producing a book. 

> Almost all the publishing costs come from print, like advertising etc. 

I don‚Äôt think you can separate the cost of marketing the print book from the cost of marketing the ebook. Maybe for some specific line items, but advertising is advertising. The cover, product placement, pull quotes, tours‚Ä¶ these all go into generally raising awareness and desirability for the book regardless of what medium people buy it in. They‚Äôre paying editors, marketers, designers, vendor relationship managers, lawyers, finance people, HR, janitors, IT people, office rent, equipment costs, etc etc - out of their revenue. There‚Äôs a ton of work and cost that goes into producing a book - we can‚Äôt just look at the cost of producing and distributing a specific format to determine what the sales price ‚Äúshould‚Äù be. All that‚Äôs determined by the market anyway.  

> Ebooks used to be a couple dollars back when kindle and book first came out. Now an ebook is as much as a paperback a lot of times or even hardcover if it is a brand new book. Authors are only getting royalties off ebook sales, the publisher isn‚Äôt doing hardly anything to justify the prices, and we are footing the (extraordinary) profits for them.

Again, prices are based on what the market will bear, not just the cost of production and distribution. If buyers are unwilling to pay a certain price, then the sellers can lower the price and hope that will increase demand. If the seller things demand will be high and that buyers will be willing to shell out some extra cash because they really want the book, then they‚Äôll raise the selling price. It‚Äôs a game to try to maximize profit (or possibly other company goals, which is why, for example, Amazon purposefully went so long without being profitable as a company).","lu0ulrd"

Being able to convert between file formats isn‚Äôt the point. I‚Äôm sure there some amount of work that goes into preparing digital formats. I don‚Äôt know how much, but regardless, my point is that much of the cost of a book getting made is shared across formats. But also, the publisher is the one managing distribution to digital retailers or digital sales through their own site. It‚Äôs simply not true to say that a publisher does basically nothing for digital book sales. 

> As to your argument that prices are set by the market, not true. The publishers set the price. Sometimes amazon or whoever run at a loss to promote the sales of ebooks, that doesn‚Äôt change the underlying structure of the business.

That‚Äôs what I mean by the market determining the price. Yes, in a very literal sense, the price is set by the publisher or retailer, but they are constrained by what the market will bear, so they will set their price as high as they think they can get away with to maximize profit for their company. 

> As far as marketing, I‚Äôve yet to see any marketing directly referencing ebooks. It‚Äôs always the print version.

Marketing is going to generally raise awareness for the book, regardless of what format people buy it in. Online ads usually point to a page where you can buy a book from a variety of retailers in a variety of formats.

You‚Äôre trying to break down a complicated process into just a few discreet steps, but that‚Äôs just not how this works. The sale of an ebook is not just covering the cost of someone exporting an epub file and uploading it to a server somewhere. Just like the sale of a car or a computer is not just covering the raw cost of components that make up the car. Profits from all sales of a book in every market and format go toward covering all costs of producing a book in all aspects. It‚Äôs a package deal. The costs of printing physical books are kind of an exception because those go up with the number of copies printed, but the rest of it you can‚Äôt really separate out neatly.","lu15g60"

"lu1o4s7","monstar98277","2024-10-27 18:15:14 UTC","It‚Äôs not a package deal. Each format of book has independent costs, different margins, and different royalty costs to the author. 
Taken directly from an authors web page:
  
Hardcover: These books retail for around $25, yet cost about 1/10th that amount ‚Äî about $2.50 to print.
Trade Paperback: Retail for about $14, cost about $1.
Mass-Market Paperback: Retail about $8, cost about $0.75.
E-Books: Retail anywhere from $0.99 to $14.99, but most new releases from large publishers are $12.99.
  Your typical hardcover book costs around $25. The retailer (Barnes & Noble or Borders) typically pays the publisher about half the list price, so the publisher gets $12.50 (assuming the book sells, otherwise the bookstore sends it back!). Of that $12.50, it costs $2.50 to actually print the book, and the author gets a 15% royalty, which is $3.75. That leaves $6.25 to the publisher, from which they have to pay for their editors, proofreaders, cover designers, print layout people, CEOs, lawyers, advertising, and rent for big offices in New York City. Whatever is left over, is profit.

The typical trade paperback sells for about $13 (maybe a bit more, but this price will line up nicely with e-book pricing), costs about $1 to make, and provides an 8% royalty to the author ($1.04). Subtract the 50% retailer cut ($6.50), and the publisher profit is $4.46.

The numbers for a mass-market paperback book that sells for $8 would include about 75 cents for printing, an 8% royalty to the author (64 cents), and the same 50% ($4) to the retailer. That means the publisher is left with $2.61 for all their costs and profit.

E-Books used to be sold under a similar model: publishers priced them the same as hardcovers (!!!), retailers paid 50% of that price to the publishers, and then sold them for whatever they wished (list price, or some discount from list price, like how Amazon sold e-books at a loss for $9.99). Publishers insisted on the agency model, where the publishers set the sales price (not the retail price), and get 70% of the proceeds. Under this model, a $13 e-book garners 30% to the retailer (like Amazon or B&N.com), 70% ($9.10) to the publisher, and an author royalty of 25% of the publisher‚Äôs net proceeds (instead of the cover price), which works out to 17.5% of the cover price, or $2.27 in our example. The publisher has no printing costs, but let‚Äôs be generous and include 10 cents or so to account for e-book file creation (which is a one-time cost divided by the number of e-books sold). Subtract the $2.27 due to the author from the remaining $9.00, and the publisher is left with $6.73.

To recap, a hardcover nets the publisher $6.25 (or 25% of the cover price), a trade paperback $4.46 (34.3%), a mass-market paperback $2.61 (32.6%), and an e-book $6.73 (51.8%).

Wait, and publishers are complaining about e-books? They just found a way to earn more money on each $13 e-book than they used to make on a $25 hardcover. The percentage of your money they‚Äôre ending up with has more than doubled in the e-book world ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the really important number, because don‚Äôt you think they can sell a lot more e-books for $13 than hardcovers for double that price?","lu1ly74"

The publisher spends $X on getting a book out into the market and makes $Y from it. They factor these different channels in together because they all affect each other.

Your claim is that authors should get almost everything from ebook sales because publishers do ""fuckall to put out an ebook"". This is not true and is not what matters in terms of pricing. Costs do not determine prices. Amount of effort does not determine prices. By your logic here, I could say that the author deserves nothing from the sale of an ebook because they did nothing to put it out onto the market. But we both know that's not how this works. Obviously the ebook would not sell if the author hadn't written it in the first place. And the ebook would not be the same product that it is, and would not have the same market exposure, without the work that the publisher put into it.

If publishers didn't make any money from ebook sales, they would have no incentive to sell them. They would not sell them from their websites, they would not negotiate deals with ebook retailers. Authors generally don't have the rights to distribute their works separately from the publisher they've contracted with, so they wouldn't be able sell ebooks on their own, and even if they could, they'd probably have to pay to license their own books back to themselves. 

But publishers wouldn't want to let them do that because it would eat into their sales.

\\> Wait, and publishers are complaining about e-books?

Who says they're complaining about ebooks? I feel like you're jumping all over the place.

\\> They just found a way to earn more money on each $13 e-book than they used to make on a $25 hardcover.

Right. And why would they give away 100% of that profit?

\\> don‚Äôt you think they can sell a lot more e-books for $13 than hardcovers for double that price?

That's probably why they do it. There's demand for books in different formats at different price points. Publishers want to maximize their profits, so they're incentivized to prioritize higher-margin items. That's why they generally don't release a paperback alongside the hardcover and why ebook prices are higher at launch than 5 years afterward. They know demand will be higher up front and that more people will be willing to pay a higher price. Later on, they printer cheaper copies so they can capture the part of the market that isn't willing to pay a higher price and they lower the ebook price for the same reason.

None of this explains why they should give 100% of ebook sales straight to the author. Why would they do this? And why would they bother to offer ebooks if they weren't going to make any money off them? Or if they were only going to make $0.65 per book (5%) instead of $6.73?

I would also like to see artists take a larger percentage of the profit, but your suggestion doesn't make  sense, it's just wishful thinking.","lu1o4s7"

Everything in the last exchange past the part where I said ‚Äútaken directly from an authors web page:‚Äù is the authors words, not mine. You are completely disregarding someone who I guarantee knows more than you or I about it. There have been a multitude of posts, articles, and videos about how the ebook system costs nothing or next to nothing. All costs associated with publishing have been standard for better than 100 years. You can find interviews from the 60‚Äôs where authors talk about how their royalties are around 5%. The publishers don‚Äôt do anything extra to market, develop or distribute ebooks. Again, I have several books that I have electronically and in print where more care was obviously taken with the print version, and there are spelling and grammatical errors in the ebook. You argue from a point of opinion and haven‚Äôt cited anything other than that. The publishers don‚Äôt commission different art work, different fonts, different anything for an ebook. They pay a one time formatting cost that is then divided amongst all the ebooks they sell. All costs are inherent in the costs of paper publications, from editing to shipping to artwork. The whole system is designed around paper publishing. Adding ebooks to the process costs nothing to add because it costs next to nothing to convert file types.","lu251by"

The passage you pulled is describing a specific part of the pipeline: A finished book being distributed in various formats. It doesn't talk about everything leading up to that point and isn't taking the entire project into account. I'm not discounting it, it's just not that relevant to my point.

\\> The publishers don‚Äôt do anything extra to market, develop or distribute ebooks.

I don't know how to refute this claim, but I don't think it's true. I'm certain I've seen advertisements for ebooks, I'm certain there is at least a salary cost for someone to manage the relationship with various ebook vendors, and, again, an advertisement for the book is going to make consumers aware of it, regardless of what format they buy it in. And again, even if it's true, it doesn't matter. It doesn't mean that they shouldn't get paid for the ebook.

\\> The publishers don‚Äôt commission different art work, different fonts, different anything for an ebook.

This doesn't matter. They did all that work for the book - as a product - regardless of the final form of that product. Even if they do no additional work for the ebook, the work they did goes into that ebook. It is part of what makes the ebook valuable. The art they commissioned, the fonts, whatever else, are used for all formats. They are part of the value of thing thing - whether the thing is digital or paper.

Even if distributing an ebook costs a publisher $0 and takes no time, that doesn't mean they don't deserve to make any money from it. They are selling something that they own the rights to sell, they're paying the author the agreed-upon fee, and consumers are paying them for it because they think it's worth the money.

Almost everything works like this to some degree. There's an initial cost of developing a product and there are costs that aren't directly related to physically manufacturing that product. Companies have to take all of these costs into account, as a whole, in order to stay in business. But also, they are free to charge whatever they think the market will bear, regardless of the cost of production.","lu295wx"

As per your original reply: 

This seems wildly inaccurate. If an author publishes through a publisher, isn‚Äôt the publisher generally handling things like marketing, the cover, and vendor relationships - including the relationships with ebook vendors and producing the actual files that will be distributed? 

My post was that the publishers do nothing in regard to making or distributing ebooks and reap profit that should go to the authors.

The author I quoted directly outlines production and how the publishers don‚Äôt have real out of pocket costs related to ebooks. As I have said there a a multitude of examples out there from people who are involved in the publishing world, they are relatively easy to find. All of the costs in publishing are borne by the traditional market, and ebooks are just a tack on profit.

If you think that a publisher has someone who gets paid to manage ebook sales vs. that just being an additional part of somebody‚Äôs job I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. 

Yes, the publisher has the right to sell ebooks as part of their contracts with the writers. My point was that ebook sales are a nearly predatory part of publishing due to the publisher doing nothing extra, and keeping all the extra profit from it. I said authors *SHOULD* receive all the money from ebooks, or at best get the lions share of the proceeds from them. We all know that would never happen due to the nature of business. You‚Äôve failed to disprove my original assertion about ebook costs, or provide proof of your positions. I hope you have a good day.","lu2emz7"
