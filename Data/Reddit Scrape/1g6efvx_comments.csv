I've been dipping in and out of dark fantasy recommendations with varying degrees of success. These two are really the only things that have quite scratched my itch - along with Blood Meridian if I'm being honest.

I've given Abercrombie (The Blade Itself), Martin (GoT) and Fletcher (Beyond Redemption) a go, but they all feel bit light and I've started a handful of others that feel a tad like they veer into YA. I think I'm looking for something medieval or religious, something horror adjacent and something pitch black in tone.

I can't seem to get as into reading as I was when I was a kid, and now I'm in my mid-twenties. I don't have to love it as much as I did back then - I have a life now - but I'd like to at least claim to have a ""taste"" in books, and to know what I like or don't like. 

This week I just read Salinger's Franny and Zooey and I loved it. The characters are well-meaning but so clumsy in their communication, it's really a very realistic family dynamic. I'd really like some book recommendations before I lose momentum - not necessarily books about difficult family dynamics, but? I do appreciate that the characters loved each other lots and tried to just be nice and I think I relate to Franny's mental breakdown/confusion. I wish I could be more specific but I haven't read/liked enough books recently to be able to.

* *Neptune's Inferno* by James Hornfischer
* *Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors* by James Hornfischer

I hugely enjoyed *Most Secret War* by Dr R V Jones and I would like to also read other accounts of people who were ""there"" and participated in various parts of the war.

"lttmqot","Crafty-Reindeer-3210","2024-10-26 08:48:14 UTC","It might just have to do with the fact that often genre writers seem to peter out as you read more of them. Maybe it has to do with the fact that their best work is in the first few books that propel them onto bookshelves. Or maybe it is that readers become familiar with the 'patterns' in these type of books and hence not find them as gripping.

If you want to read a 'longer' book without it becoming boring, maybe pick up the best books of a particular author as they might pack the most punch. I would recommend ""The Odessa File"" by Frederick Forsyth or one of the early Jack Reacher books (Lee Child). John Grisham or Michael Connelly if you are into crime/detective/procedural type plots. For genre writers the rule of thumb seems to be that the first few books tend to have the best bang for buck.

You seem to enjoy high fantasy and sci-fi though so maybe something like Sphere by Michael Crichton or even Jurassic Park may fit the bill.

1) A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain

2) The Fifth Season, by N.K. Jemisin

3) Lies My Teacher Told Me, by James W. Loewen

4) Stranger in a Strange Land, by Robert Heinlein (by no means my favorite, but it's one of those books ""well-read"" people read, and there are concepts I learned from it that still stick with me.)

5) How to Change Your Mind, by Michael Pollan

6) The Princess Bride, by William Goldman

7) At least 3 Shakespeare plays that aren't Romeo & Juliet (per my wife, the theater teacher). My personal favorites are Hamlet, Loves Labors Lost, and 12th Night.

8) 1984 and/or Animal Farm, by George Orwell (I do not recommend you read these back to back, like I did)

9) Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury

10) A Certain Hunger, by Chelsea G. Summers","lu0d6w5"
