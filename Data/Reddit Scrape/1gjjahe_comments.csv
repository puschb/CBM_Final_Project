"lvebrn9","res30stupid","2024-11-04 19:29:01 UTC","Yeah, this led to his girlfriend being screwed in the courts (and the true sequels never being finished).

Because the Swedish courts legally require couples to publicly publish their address when getting marries, Larsson and his girlfriend flat-out couldn't get married without putting him in the crosshairs of Neo-Nazis who would've targetted him due to his reporting on their activities. And after he died, Stieg's father and brother used this to disinherit her from his will and sieze control of the Millennium franchise (ironically, said will also disinherited *them* - Larsson hated his family).",""

Addresses specifically are handled by our tax authorities and since they are a governmental authority their work is public, which is a good thing. There are secret addresses given for people in instances where your public information will demonstrably harm you, but you have to apply for it. 

This was honestly a really fine way of handling things before digitalisation hit. You had to call, or mail, give your name, pay a fee, and demand a specific act, and the specific authorities you were demanding information from had to approve it, and could deny it. You could usually not obtain a large number of information very speedily or easily, or anonymously. Now you only have to google it, and because of private parties, everything is much more accessible, which has become a more widespread issue.

In a more general sense though, its a case by case basis wether you would be granted it, theyre kind of stingy with it as it has its downsides, and you would have to take it to the police or the tax authorities and make your case, but its frequently used in very serious domestic cases. 

Theres like 3 forms of it, first form is it would be harder to access your information and it is ”flagged” as more sensitive and cannot be divulged to just anyone, second your new secret address is not listed at all, only your old one, but other authorities might see that you are under secret listing, and thirdly would be secret identity where you would be given new documentation and names in the case where the police judges that it might have an impact, and is very much a last resort type of thing (as i would imagine in most countries lol). 

So the different forms demand 1. Legitimate threat of violence to your life and health, and 2. That it would reasonably have an effect and is enforceable

If i speculate I would guess he might have tried the first 2, and the information might have been leaked anyway, considering the sheer number of people out to get him, and the secret identity is moot as he wouldnt have gone for that by giving up his work (and his face was too well known honestly).","lvh8oze"

>This is the one relevant to the conversation. The previous commenter already referred to ""Offentlighetsprincipen"" (Principle of Public Access to Official Records) which isnt the actual fundamental law itself but rather it's defined within it. Besides giving us the right to access public records it more widely protects media from having to be approved by any representantative from government before its published. It also grants every citizen the right to initiate contact with a news outlet as well as establishing the duty for any journalist to protect the identity of someone who has given them information. The government cant demand journalists to give up their sources for example.

**The Law on Freedom or Expression (Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen)**

>This along with the previous one makes up what is essentially our rights to not be censored. This law however referres to everything that is **not** printed material. It defines our rights to express ourselves in things like Radio, TV and the Internet, but it does not do this for books or news magazines, that's what the previous law does.

**The Act of Succession (Successionsordningen)**

>This one is quite straightforward, it defines the line of succession for the royal family. In 1980 this one was amended to make the firstborn of the royals the heir of the throne regardless of wether they are a man or a woman.","lvgdzvx"

It also weaves in a strong layer of social commentary without overshadowing the plot. In contrast, the second and third books shift more towards social commentary, with less emphasis on the plot. In those, Lisbeth's journey becomes more personal—she tracks down her father and seeks revenge, while in the third book, she stands trial but turns the tables, essentially putting society itself on trial.

In the second book she is revealed as the daughter of a KGB spy who threw a moltov cocktail into his car aged 12, is shot in the head and survives, digs her way out of a grave, gets into a fight with a motorcycle gang, oh and devises Fermats orginal therom for his famous lost proof. 

In the third book she it is toned down a little bit. 

But my issue wasn't with the change from locked door mystery to a series of book about misogeny destorying a womens life and the state helping.

Seeing as she left $12 million dollars to her dog^2 instead and the signs she was indeed senile when she did so, the judge re-established the grandkids as heirs to her estate.

1: For reference, Helmsley was famously known as the Queen of Mean, known as a total tyrant in regards to how she ran her hotel business in New York, including throwing a cup of tea - saucer and all - at a maid for spilling even a tiny amount, and openly boasting that ""Only the little people pay taxes"". By the way, most of her fortune and businesses were seized for tax fraud.

2: The dog wasn't entirely disinherited, for reference. From the $12 million Helmsley left Trouble, this was reduced to $2 million in a financial trust to take care of the dog, with the unspent funds going back to the grandkids when the dog died. The kids were then left $10 million.","lves0p3"

Don't be silly. Abusive people are not a specific to any age group, race, culture, religion or gender.

And changing the definition of a word to suit your personal beliefs and purposes doesn't make it so.

PS It does sound like you are speaking out of a personal experience that as colored your perception. I'm sorry that happened to you. Actual abuse should never happen no matter what generation you belong to.","lvhiugs"

But anyway the difference between Scandinavia and rest of the western world on this data is that if you have to formally request it there's a record about who asked for that information, which can be very useful in stalking cases. And the person whose information is given may get a notice. Plus usually the person requesting the info pays a fee (like 10€) which discourages harvesting that info on a large scale.

But even aside all of that, I don't understand what's so strange with me not wanting to have my personal data public by default, harvested and monetized by private companies without my consent. It seems like a pretty basic right to me.","lvhxgo6"

Stalking is a serious offence, but also not a very wide spread phenomenon. Changing the entire system to combat it is excessive when smaler actions can help, such as permitting secret adresses for those who need it. And actual police action against stalkers, instead of ignoring such cases.","lvhzgxm"

- age and date of birth
- full address including how to get to the door
- full address of the previous home where this person lived
- size or the apartment 
- estimated value of the apartment 
- phone number 
- name and age of who lives there together with that person
- average age, voting patterns and median income in that zone, with a link to get the actual declared income of the person

To get your name out of these sites you have to personally contact each one by one","lvhzxwr"
