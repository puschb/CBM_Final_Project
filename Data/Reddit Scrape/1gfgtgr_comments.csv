"luhjumh","FirstOfRose","2024-10-30 07:37:16 UTC","Literary, in this context, usually refers to literature with themes of the human experience and ideas. A lot of fiction does this to some level, but for literary fiction it’s the point, not just the plot. It also is more concerned with prose and language itself. 

I haven’t read a lot of classics yet but the ones I have definitely earned the title. The biggest benefit for me has been more thought provoking reads. I still enjoy a lot of contemporary fiction though. They can evoke similar thoughts and feelings as classics, it’s just that there’s so many more modern works than there are the relatively small pool of what are widely considered classics, so it’s less likely to run into a future classic. 

I don’t pay much attention to ‘best sellers’ lists",""
"luhk04j","palemontague","2024-10-30 07:39:05 UTC","Literary fiction is the variety that people on this sub like to call pretentious. Good literary fiction is usually unreliant on traditional plot devices (although that's not excluded), focusing instead on approaching profound themes without compromising the abstract potential of language. It is often experimental and almost always nuanced, resisting both easy classification and interpretation.",""
"lui1v5b","PeteForsake","2024-10-30 10:52:02 UTC","I think the easier way to divide it is ""literary fiction"" vs ""genre fiction"".

Both literary and genre fiction can be high quality or turgid crap, both can be profound and emotionally engaging or rubbish and formulaic, both can be groundbreaking art or by the numbers commercialism. This is not about the quality of the writing. It's about the intent behind it. 

At heart, genre fiction exists to tell a story in a distinct, separate world. Literary fiction tries to be part of a shared human story in this world.There is also some crossover of course - Never Let Me Go is both sci-fi and literary fiction; War and Peace is both a historical adventure romp and literary fiction. This happens when the author both wants to tell a good story in a distinct world and show how it reflects a shared story in our world.

I read a lot of genre fiction, mainly sci-fi and historical adventure stories. I also read a lot of literary fiction. The former excites me and the latter makes me feel empathy with others.",""
"luhk94z","sadworldmadworld","2024-10-30 07:42:00 UTC","At least for me, literary fiction and non-literary fiction serve quite different roles (basically the difference between watching something like Black Mirror vs. Gossip Girl).

These are somewhat personal definitions, but I consider a book literary fiction if it shifts my perspective on the world in some fundamental way — it has ""depth,"" as you put it, in the sense that it adds a dimension to my understanding of the world and the human experience. There is  significant intention and thought behind the prose, characters/relationships, and concepts that the author writes.

Non-literary fiction is often much more plot-focused and is easier to get into and often, more enjoyable to read. A lot of what you're seeing on the ""bestseller"" lists falls into this category because of the accessibility. Examples: A Court of Thorns and Roses, Fourth Wing, novels by Dan Brown, novels by Colleen Hoover (e.g. It Ends With Us). I find myself reading more non-literary fiction when I'm already overwhelmed by other things in my life because I don't have to use my brain to read it and can just enjoy the ride.

**Some of my favorite (readable + have depth) relatively-modern lit fic novels:**

* Kazuo Ishiguro's novels. ***Remains of the Day*** and ***Never Let Me Go*** are the most well-known. RotD is a masterpiece in its subtle tension and >!unreliable!< narrator/character unveiling, but the themes in NLMG had a greater emotional impact on me. My personal favorite is probably *An Artist of the Floating World,* but it makes sense to start with the more well-known ones because they're definitely not lacking in any way lol.
* Kurt Vonnegut's works are basically absurdist satires, and can be quite humorous while having tons of ""depth."" I'd say you should start with ***Slaughterhouse Five*** if you're interested in philosophizing on war or ***Cat's Cradle*** if you want an exploration of religion and science.
* ***I Who Have Never Known Men***\\*:\\* Fairly short read that packs a punch. I started it with the intention of reading like 20 pages and then didn't get up from my seat for 4 hours.
* ***The Secret History*** by Donna Tartt: Brilliant character work, but can be a little slow in the middle. ""Dark academia"" in the sense of highlighting the privilege of obsessing over abstract concepts.",""
"lui6fc0","zendrumz","2024-10-30 11:30:38 UTC","Having a literary concern with language doesn’t necessitate using as many big or obscure words as possible. Literary minimalism from Hemingway or Carver was an intentional attempt to strip language back to the basics, and obviously their restricted vocabulary and short sentences are carefully designed to achieve a specific effect. Their mastery is obvious. And it’s equally obvious that every writer you listed - with the exception of Rooney who I personally think is vastly overrated - is deeply concerned with the specific effect their linguistic choices have on the reader.

To me, that’s what literary fiction is: when the author acknowledges that the medium is the message, and has the control to use that fact effectively in the service of art, rather than focusing primarily on plot or other externalities. Just using big words, flowery language, purple prose, excessive descriptive passages, or endless elaborate metaphors won’t get you there.",""
"lujm7vp","MattCanTryThat","2024-10-30 16:24:43 UTC","It's kind of a fuzzy distinction with a lot of overlap, but I've always felt like when people talk about literary fiction, they're talking about books with a focus on characters and their internal life, creative prose, and some kind of attempt to explore themes about the human condition and life in an insightful way.  Non literary fiction does not do that.

""Genre fiction"" is often contrasted with literary fiction, but of course there's overlap and genre fiction with great prose and characters. I think the best contrast is that genre fiction focuses more on plot, tropes and cliches (either following them closely or lampshading and undermining them), and entertainment value rather than insight into the human condition. I think Oscar bait movies vs popcorn movies are a good parallel.

I personally love both. I think people can be dismissive of literary fiction as being pretentious when it's just not their thing or went over their heads. On the other hand, I also think people can be dismissive of genre fiction - i think writing an exciting plot, recognizing and undercutting common genre tropes, and pacing a story to keep readers engaged and on the edge of their seats (couches?) takes a lot of skill even when the prose might be so so or the characters a bit stock.

The classics seem like they're always called literary fiction, I guess since they stood the test of time. For modern lit fic, I'm terrible at remembering titles off the top of my head, but in my experience, picking up anything from library new releases that won a prize (National Book Award, Booker Prize) or was a finalist is a pretty good way to reliably find good ones.",""
"luiom6s","ZennyDaye","2024-10-30 13:31:46 UTC","Generally speaking, you have literary fiction and genre fiction.

Genre fiction implies that there's a generalized format of plot beats to expect. In the romance genre, you have your meet cute and happily ever after, in your fantasy, there's world building, in cozy mysteries there's a big reveal at the end as to who the killer is, etc

Literary fiction is also telling a story, but one without the expected plot beats. You read it and see where it goes. 

It does not necessarily have beautiful stylistic prose that's peak word-smithing. It doesn't need to be poetic, etc. it might even hit the very same plot beats as genre fiction, it might even be a lightheaded comedy. The difference is where the focus lies. Is the author trying to hit plot beats and deliver a story that meets reader expectations? Or are they focusing on a particular theme? Are they focusing on showing the reader some kind of insight into how to go about life?

These days, there's sort of a sliding scale between the two now. More and more genre writers want to be taken seriously and show their skills, some literary writers also want their story to be popular and go mainstream. eg, something like Gone Girl is obviously a mystery, but Gillian Flynn is also using those plot beats to develop a ""literary character"" in Amy Dunne with heavy deconstruction of superficial feminist themes to the point where you can say that Gone Girl isn't about the mystery at all.

I started with literary fiction and only got to genre afterwards when I got to secondary school when they got me hooked on Anne Rice. Both are good. Some excellent books on both sides. Some true blue stinkers on both sides.

That brings up another point. What's considered literary and what's considered genre is always changing with time. The classics we have today were mostly genre when they came out. 

Anne Rice wanted to tell religious gothic stories about vampires and the pain of human existence stretched out over centuries... And she accidentally gave birth to Twilight which is probably as generic as  genre gets.

I don't know what to recommend for you. Since you haven't read much, I'd still say to start with genre. Maybe some cozy mysteries or some transgressive lit which tends to be the best of both worlds. Fight Club is a fun one most people enjoy. 

Or some Hemingway. Old Man and the Sea is a short read and you can see if you like that style. 

Most books these days explore human behavior, that's too vague to get worthwhile recommendations from.",""
"luj2r35","Comprehensive-Fun47","2024-10-30 14:46:56 UTC","When there's something deeper going on and the word choice seems very thoughtful, it's probably literary fiction.

I just read a book with the most bland writing. There was nothing deeper going on. The story was the story. There's nothing wrong with books like that, but I wouldn't call them literature.

It's not like there's a clear line between the two. I'm sure some books straddle a fuzzy edge of such a line.

If you want to read books with deeper themes or more challenging language*, look at lists of literary fiction instead of bestsellers.

*Though challenging language is not a prerequisite of literary fiction. Some might have very simple language. But it is deliberate.",""

Literary fiction tends to be for readers who resemble the latter. If you get a kick out of the actual style of prose, how the stories are structured, what techniques might go into a story to surprise or create a unique experience for the reader, etc., then you will probably like literary fiction.

"luhr9rz","monsantobreath","2024-10-30 09:03:47 UTC","My favourite work of literary fiction is Michael Ondaatje's In the Skin of a Lion. It's fits the criteria of metaphor, finer prose (Ondaatje is a poet first so his prose is very much driven by thr imagery that leads to reflection beyond literally describing what's happening and beauty of the language itself) and thematic elements that speak beyond plot.

The themes are about the invisible immigrant communities that built early 20th century Toronto, the fictional characters and plot and staging based on real events found in newspapers and current events but told to explore the part of the story made invisible by the powerful and dominant cultural forces that didn't record their contributions in the mainstream record.

If the book is too entertaining it’s automatically genre.

If the book is too stylistic it’s automatically literary.

If the book is a blend of both style and entertaining, the category is determined by:

Is it very serious ™? (Meaning no comedy without a balancing of emotional torture porn and/or spiritualism) - that’s literary

Does it concern the intellectual elite somehow? (commentary/satire about professionals or Ivy League schools etc) - that’s literary

Does it comment on current events, but only in a way that either agrees with the elite status quo consensus or says “it’s very complex, too complex for any other analysis than it’s so complex” - that’s literary

Is it funny in a broad way that most people would find entertaining? That’s genre.

Does it make radical or unpopular commentary on social or political issues? That’s genre.

Is it about actual normal people, but not thinly veiled memoir? That’s genre.

I grew up loving classics and reading a lot of 'literature' and I honestly thought literary was just a synonym for fiction or books in general.

Once I finally heard the term 'literary fiction', things started making more sense, but I still didn't have a clear definition of it.  I read somewhere that literary fiction  is more character focused, while genre fiction is more plot focused and this usually holds true for the books I like.  I like to read about complex characters, their psychology, and their complex  relationships with others.  Often, when my husband asks what a book I'm reading is about, I'll only have some characters to describe: ""it's about this parent and child and their life together"" or ""it's about a boy growing up on a farm and learning life lessons""...but he wants to know ""so, what happens?"".

Approach it like your approach paintings.  Some paintings are hung at the world's most elite museums and priced in the millions while others are bought for 20 bucks at Ross and hung at the local McDonalds.  People enjoy both paintings within their context.  the difference is the perspective, skill, and impact of the paintings on the greater culture.  We are influenced by Monet's waterlilies, Van Gogh's Sunflowers, and Davinci's Mona Lisa.  It's the same with novels.    

Literary fiction are works that either marked or spawned a cultural shift, demonstrated profound artistry in terms of things like plot structure, sentence construction, or character development, or have been recognized by scholars and academics in the world of Literary studies as noteworthy.  For example, Romanticism as a movement in England started with the publication of Wordsworth and Coleridge's collection of poems titled Lyrical Ballads.  Thanks to that work, we have Frankenstein, we have Northanger Abby, we have Prometheus Unbound and Don Juan.       

Nonliterary fiction is fiction that did not make the same impact than Literary fiction.  Basically, everything that is not Literary fiction.  There are plenty of books that were, at one point, classified as ""nonliterary"" and then became canonized as Literary fiction.  Beowulf, for example, was not considered great literature until Old English scholars like J.R.R. Tolkien started publishing articles about the literary value of older folklore.  Now every kid in the British Isles is forced to read it in school.  

It's easier to discern what is ""Literary fiction"" in older works because there has been time for the literary world to study them and talk about it.  However, I think it's generally accepted that contemporary works considered ""literary"" are ones that show up on the short and long lists of prestigious book prizes like the National Book Award, The Nobel Prize in Literature, The Pulitzer, and the Booker Prize.  Contemporary authors who end up on these lists are writers like Jesmyn Ward, Zadie Smith, Jonathan Franzen, Louise Erdrich, Marilyn Robinson, Colson Whitehead, and James McBride.",""

There are also novels written by ""literary"" authors that I wouldn't personally consider successful in adding some kind of profound insight to the world (e.g. Kazuo Ishiguro's *Klara and the Sun,* kinda), so it's not like I tell myself the emperor *always* has clothes on; I think critically about it.

Literary fiction does not require an obvious metaphor.

Literary fiction does not require a ""pretentious"" title, and the title doesn't change the content inside. Lord of the Flies would not not be taught in schools if it had a different title.

Literary fiction is entertaining and is not required to be boring.

Literary fiction may have more detail, but genre fiction has a lot of detail too. It is not exclusive to literary fiction to specify the breeze or the people they pass. It's more about why are those details being included. Do they relate to something else going on in the book? Are they setting an atmosphere? The language used is important, but I don't think you can say a literary novel describes things more than a fantasy novel with a ton of world building. Or a mystery novel where every detail could be a clue.

Romeo and Juliet has been analyzed to death. We know all the themes and still teach it to high school students. We very much learned about the sex jokes when we read Romeo and Juliet.

To add some nuance to that, I consider Ishiguro's works literary fiction with elements of sci-fi whereas LeGuin's are sci-fi and literary fiction because I don't think Ishiguro's works would satisfy a sci-fi reader (e.g. all the people that read Never Let Me Go and ask why the characters didn't escape, or why we don't get more details about the world — very genre fic expectations to have of a book that is really just about the human experience).

"lujf0yc","Hanako_Seishin","2024-10-30 15:48:32 UTC","The thing is that Russian for ""fiction"" is ""художественная литература"", literally ""artistic literature"", which as I remember from school goes alongside other types of literature such as scientific literature and publicistic literature, and this ""artistic literature"" is then further divided into epos (mostly prose, tells stories), lyrics (mostly poems, conveys feelings) and drama (plays, meant to be acted out). So it just puts me into stupor how English treats literature as a subset of fiction, when I was always taught in school that the whole fiction is only a subset of literature. If an article in a newspaper is literature enough then surely any kind of cheesy vampire romance is literature too. It's written word and it has an author, so it's by definition literature. But then I go to English Wikipedia and apparently even classics of science fiction is not literature because... it belongs to a genre? What? What piece of fiction doesn't belong to any genre? The concept of genre was created to classify the pieces of fiction, so even if you were to write something that doesn't belong to any existing genre, we'll just say it's a new genre and make a new name for it. And surely any older works of fiction that form the classics of literature have long been throughly classified, so now they can't be literature? Also the way you say this way of thinking of literature makes it a genre... but as it's defined as not belonging to a genre, then nothing can be literature. If something is literature, it now belongs to the genre ""literature"", but by belonging to a genre it's not literature anymore.

That is what I remember from when I read something about him. 

It's everyone else who is making these literary vs everything else categories. But I don't know anything for sure. Maybe Kurt Vonnegut is an exceptional example, but he's probably not the only one.

Not adding to any points here, but for Never Let Me Go, I remember being put off that the author didn't take the SciFi aspects (of science bits being believable) seriously enough for me and I stopped reading it halfway. I don't remember the details since it's been awhile, but IMO, for Sci-Fi to be Sci-Fi, the author has to make the science really work, no matter how absurd the science may seem.","lujfzjv"

"luk9dbf","MatterOfTrust","2024-10-30 18:18:01 UTC","I feel like the target audience of r/books and Ready Player One does not intersect in a meaningful way, which is why the book is often criticized on this sub. It reminds me of criticism of the Scott Pilgrim film, whose only fault was that it was aimed at a rather niche combination of several subcultures.

Ready Player One is an important book. It is a generation-defining book. It is a powerful experience, a quintessential representation of a very select, specific group of people who usually fly under the radar of the rest of us. I feel that the reason that this book is looked down upon so often is because there is barely any cross-section between the redditors in non-gaming subs and the kind of gamers, nerds and other marginal elements that RPO is meant to represent.

Have you ever met people whose dedication went beyond any reasonable extremes? The kind of people who are knowledgeable, kind, charismatic, friendly, likeable - yet remain complete and utter failures in professional or personal life? There might be many reasons for that - poor health, complete lack of socialization, natural awkwardness, family drama, mental illness and more - but the result is usually the same - full, pinpoint, laser focus on the one thing, and one thing only, that they can do best. In this case, it's gaming.

Now, there is little to no hope for a person like I described to achieve any notable results in competitive games, like the RPO protagonist managed to do, simply because the gaming success on an esports scene comes down to many more factors than just individual skill or the number of hours put into the game itself. But the poor odds will never deter the person from dreaming - and in these big dreams, maintaining their sanity, chugging along, smiling through tears and maybe, eventually, with luck, building some sort of semblance of a normal life, isolated as it may be. That life might not involve any IRL friends, or a partner, or a job, but it's still better than suicide, so who are we to judge?

And it's not always going to be an esports dream that keeps you going, too - it might be something more mundane, like maintaining a collection, or small-time streaming, or writing reviews in your personal blog that no sane soul will ever read. In the end, it doesn't matter, because behind all these activities, there is still a real person - a person who cut out any parts of themselves that didn't work out or failed to develop, and set their sights on a single, all-encompassing goal that can never be achieved, but is still worth trying for.

And such is the essence of Ready Player One. Not the torrent of references (which are still good, by the way, and helped me to discover a lot of awesome bands and films that I happened to overlook back in the day), not the power fantasy, not the Disney-like happy ending, where the hero gets the princess. RPO does one thing well, and it's a very important thing - it gives voice to a subset of people who normally go unnoticed. People like Parzival and Art3mis, whose entire raison d'etre is an unachievable, impossible dream that they still must compete for, because there is nothing else in their life - not today, nor tomorrow, nor ever.

"lukefaz","sadworldmadworld","2024-10-30 18:42:43 UTC","I mean...sure, there's nothing about a book steeped in misery that is inherently more valuable. There *are* literary fiction novels with happy endings, like Jane Austen's works and Shakespeare's comedies (which my education included). Just because you  couldn't relate to or learn anything from classic works doesn't mean that they're pretentious or that people enjoying them are lying to themselves when they say that they enjoy them.

I think in general, there are many more lit fic novels that are depressing/that's just what's published, so that's what the curriculum tends to include and idrk what the solution to that is other than, abstractly, as a society, tackling the question of what makes misery appealing. But it's not like that's going to happen anytime soon.

Relevant quote! *“The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist; a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.” - Ursula LeGuin.*

Sad endings do tend to linger with me (and a lot of people) more, but that's subjective and it's not like I can change that about my tastes. If something has a happy ending, it's not going to continue bothering me, which means I'm not going to continue thinking about and trying to reframe it. I prefer tragedy in my TV shows as well. On that note, I think writers like Vonnegut somewhat bridge the gap re. books with dark themes that still have tons of humor and not being super serious or depressing throughout, and it's not like we don't consider him literary nowadays (he did used to be condescended for writing ""sci-fi,"" but our definition of literature is expanding). 

I don't really get what your point is about ACOTAR. Of course there are people reading the classics just to be able to say they've read them. That has always been and always will be the case. Humans just have the tendency to find ways to distinguish and differentiate ourselves/feed our superiority complexes to stave off our existential crises. See: *The Secret History.* But even then, I think there's something to be said for trying to broaden your horizons\\*, assuming you aren't bragging about it. If someone *is* bragging about it, your problem isn't with literary fiction, it's with them as an individual; they're certainly the type to brag about other things as well.

It can also refer to academic studies, documents that provide information, or really any body of text. Literature is not the same as literary fiction. The signs in bookstores are making the issue more confusing than it should be. 

Literary fiction as an idea is tangled up in that special sense of literature. But here it doesn’t mean great. It's more like trying to be great in some specific way. Plus it's a catch-all for books that don't fit another specific genre. Again, this definition is marketing, not art

Another trick is that genre is used in multiple senses:

I can see how critics used to look down on genre fic more than we do nowadays, but that doesn't really have anything to do with me lol.

There are definitely other authors that cross genres. Best example from my very limited reading history is *Ender's Game* — I assume it could stand-alone as sci-fi but it is a very human- and character-centered novel. Maybe I just haven't read enough of Vonnegut's works to see how he's sci-fi (or maybe it's more like...he's sci-fi in the way Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is sci-fi lol). But again, I am not a sci-fi reader so idk how sci-fi readers view his novels.

I agree on NLMG not being sci-fi (and your definition of it), and Kazuo Ishiguro definitely didn't intend for it to be portrayed as such — that was on the marketing team. As I brought up, any reader that goes into NLMG expecting sci-fi will inevitably be disappointed by it, which is why I consider it more literary fiction with sci-fi elements than actual sci-fi.","lujo8to"

He didn't know he *was* labeled sci-fi until he read reviews for one of his books.

From the Wikipedia page for Player Piano:

*\\[Player Piano's\\] satirical take on industrialization and the rhetoric of* [*General Electric*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric)[*^(\\[10\\])*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Piano_%28novel%29#cite_note-LampoonOnGE-10) *and the big corporations, which discussed arguments very topical in the postwar United States, was instead advertised by the publisher with the more innocuous and marketable label of ""science fiction"", a genre that was booming in mass* [*popular culture*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture) *in the 1950s. Vonnegut, surprised by that reception, wrote, ""I learned from reviewers that I was a science-fiction author. I didn't know that."" He was distressed because he felt that science fiction was shoved in a drawer which ""many serious critics regularly mistake... for a urinal"" because ""\\[t\\]he feeling persists that no one can simultaneously be a respectable writer and understand how a refrigerator works.""*

Which checks out lol. If nothing else, I guess publishing companies have stayed consistent between the publishing of *Player Piano* and *Never Let Me Go*.

It's not that it's about video games and pop culture obsession (I won't knock someone for being nerdy about those when other things, like sports, are considered the acceptable things to be nerdy about). It's that abandoning the real world entirely, the one that's falling apart, is a *bad* thing. It's the easy decision, not the sensible one. The book is aware of this; it just doesn't care and prioritizes indulging in it's references until gives a token acknowledgement of its dystopia.

I agree with you that you shouldn't badmouth a work you haven't read. I appreciate that sci-fi is finally getting some of the recognition it deserves. As a genre it has had an impact on many peoples lives so many in innovative people credit it with sparking their creativity and yet it is often treated dismissively. I hope that someday romance and comics are afforded similar treatment.

I wish I was more articulate.

Furthermore, you're separating prose from the actual ideas prose is used to communicate, as if prose itself is what makes literature Literature. But let's say Nabokov wrote a recipe for a cake.

There's a very big difference between Rooney (whos lack of speech marks makes her get criticised constantly) who has an obvious style and the whole point of the novel is to explore themes rather than being plot-focused vs genre fiction that is primarily plot focused and isn't concerned with the prose outside of moving the story along.","luo79dl"

Just like fandoms on the whole, it stifles creativity and originality, and it rewards regurgitating the same stuff over and over again, because anything new and challenging is seen as bad and wrong. Yet at the same time they try to lay claim to being *extra* creative, because dragons or whatever. It's a great way to stay childlike and cocooned while also feeling superior and smug","luifn7f"

So does Jonathan Dee's The Privileges. That doesn't make it automatically good, nor does it align with belletristic aims.","lukid89"

My collection is extensive but the books I find myself recommending over and over are character studies where despite the external conflicts , war and such, the real conflict comes from the characters own psychological pain and damage. The best books require that the characters have realistic personalities, reactions and motivation.","lukvwpr"

Venturing far and wide in your imagination while remaining both in the comfort of your bed *and* in the comfort of not straining your brain. Now some might say I'm condemning that, and I generally do not, unless you're one of those who considers oneself as big of an intellectual as Harold Bloom while reading nothing but books like The Lettuce Of Stardust And Fornication.","luigtiz"
"lulalcm","Revasy","2024-10-30 21:19:54 UTC","The irony here is just hilarious! One guy (with lots of downvotes) claims that a lot of literary fiction books are pretentious, so you complain that the mysterious group of ""they"" calls everything pretentious while feeling intellectually superior and then you go on to claim that anyone of ""them"", including apparently anyone who's in any fandom and anyone enjoying dragons, are ""wildly anti-intellectual"", see ""anything new and challenging [..] as bad or wrong"" and ""stay childlike and cocooned while also feeling superior and smug"".

And you're sure you're not the one feeling intellectually superior here? Absolutely sure?","luigtiz"
