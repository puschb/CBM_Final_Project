"lx2ftev","Elulah","2024-11-14 10:38:08 UTC","I feel I can comment honestly on this as I used to be like this and I‚Äôm now, happily, reformed.  Though might I say I was never aggressive and dismissive of other people‚Äôs choices with it like this guy - I‚Äôd just convinced myself personally that, for me, fiction was a waste of time.  So I‚Äôve gone from someone who went through a time of only reading non-fiction (though admittedly, not very much of it), to reading a lot of fiction.  I now hate that I‚Äôve missed out on so many years of reading, but I‚Äôm making up for lost time now üòä

I used to think there was nothing to learned from fiction, and learning is what I valued.  Sounds like this guy is similar, but he‚Äôs being pompous with it.  He sees fiction as frivolous and is desperate to illustrate how very serious, grown up, lofty and learned he is.  That‚Äôs an insecurity on his part.  Nothing wrong with having personal taste for certain things but you don‚Äôt need to disparage others who don‚Äôt share the same taste.  He is protesting too much, quite frankly.  

But, criticism of this guy‚Äôs attitude aside, in defence of fiction -

Fiction has an immense amount to teach us about the human condition, and often in a very crystalline, encapsulated way that non-fiction would struggle to achieve without being unwieldy and cumbersome.  I can read a non-fiction book about a historical war, for instance.  A book with all the cold hard facts.  Dates, battles etc.  I then might have to read a separate non-fiction book about the human side of that war.  The testimony of the people who were there, their feelings, how it changed them and their lives, the unexpected impact and consequences.  The humanising elements.  The personal cost, the micro as opposed to macro scale that helps us relate to and understand a situation which we (hopefully) have never experienced and will never experience.  A fiction book can assimilate elements of both extremely neatly and successfully, with subtlety and nuance, and in an immersive manner which increases reader empathy.  

I have also learned a lot about historical events and stories I was previously ignorant to by reading fiction.  Recently, I have picked up novels on a whim, based on an intriguing blurb, and quite by accident learned about the dancing plague in Strasbourg (The Dance Tree, Kiran Millwood Hargrave),  the witch trials of vardo (The Witches of Vardo, Anya Bergman and The Mercies, Kiran Millwood Hargrave), the mutiny and shipwreck of the Batavia (The Night Ship, Jess Kidd), the life of Anne Lister (The Moss House, Clara Barley), the mysterious disappearance of the Eilean Mor lighthouse keepers (The Lamplighters, Emma Stonex)‚Ä¶ I could go on.  Consequently I‚Äôve learned a lot about the wider context of women‚Äôs historical place in society and our struggle for equality and rights, delivered in an engaging way.  This issue could easily sound cold from a purely factual text, but moreso I would not have sought out non-fiction about some of these individual events, would‚Äôve been unlikely to stumble across them, and consequently would still be ignorant. And therefore my understanding about women‚Äôs societal challenges historically would be less rounded. 

Then there is the delivery of certain messages.  Take George Orwell‚Äôs 1984.  You could read an essay espousing the same ideas, warning of the same dangers.  But it wouldn‚Äôt *hit* like this book.  It‚Äôs the show don‚Äôt tell thing.  I could write a factual piece, trying to get my reader to imagine what it would be like to live in a world like that.  But nothing will impart that better than placing the reader directly in a characters shoes.  You could even end up sounding like a kook or conspiracy theorist.  Yes, 1984 is dystopian fiction, but we‚Äôre seeing some elements become fact in real time.  So this book is extremely valuable in illustrating the extreme but logical conclusion of technocratic state overreach.  I think many people would not even recognise some of things currently happening as the slowly creeping, insidious danger they are, without this illuminating book.  This work of fiction has been an infinitely more successful medium to convey his message than an essay ever would‚Äôve been, with far greater reach. 

Also, *everyone* needs some escapism, including this guy, guaranteed.  He obviously just find his in a different way.  That‚Äôs fine, until he disparages others for theirs.  So there is some hypocrisy there.  He thinks he‚Äôs coming across enlightened, but to my mind nothing is less enlightened than disparaging people for finding theirs by reading, of all things, and by having a mind so closed you dismiss entire swathes of books wholesale, including literary masterpieces.  Truly growing up would mean recognising the value of both, without using wholesale dismissal of one as an opportunity for self-aggrandisement.",""

I really like both genres, but I feel like nonfiction is over-hyped for its learning effect. Just ask him how much he actually remembers of the book he read six months ago. Apart from the key messages and themes, he probably won‚Äôt remember much, but that also applies to fiction.

Romantic, fantasy or fantastic stories are first of all the experience of other people. It helps us to know what others may feel in particular situation we've never been. It teaches us DIFFERENT ways of solving life problems. Genre is only a form, shape where you put meaning. When I read fantasy, I learn how to cope with sudden circumstances change, how to deal with fears, how to make friends, how to fight enemies. 

It is also a moral guide. Through stories like this we learn what is good and what is bad, and most important - what are the consequences of passing over rules. 

So it teaches as much as non fiction. Just they teach different things. If a person totally avoids fiction, I would be concerned because it usually points out their poor ability to understand or engage in social and  interpersonal being as an emotionally mature member of society",""
"lx2dliq","watercastles","2024-11-14 10:14:08 UTC","Of course both are important, but I can't help but roll my eyes when someone says fiction has no value outside of entertainment. I think they want to sound erudite, but it's quite narrow-minded‚Äîfoolish even. Educated does not mean they are clever or wise.

Non-fiction can give you knowledge.

Fiction can give you wisdom. 

Fiction can be a wellspring of knowledge too.

Sure some works of fiction are of lower caliber, but the same is true for works of non-fiction.

In the words of Tim O'Brien in his semi-autobiographical book _The Things They Carried_, ""Story-truth is truer sometimes than happening-truth."" I think that specifically was from the chapter where he describes killing a man, but later reveals those specific events never actually happened. There are things fiction can convey better and in a way that is more aligned with how people experience their lives.

Both Kurt Vonnegut and Tim O'Brien added fictional elements to their books about their own experience in war. I think for both of them the fiction elements help to better express how it felt during the war and how it affected their lives after.

In terms of defending fiction... Fiction is where we process the human experience, where we share stories that help us understand and empathize with others. The abolitionist movement spread, in part, because *Uncle Tom's Cabin* helped people understand the human dimensions of enslavement. ""Important novels"" are important for a reason. They can get past the mere facts and convey how it felt to be at sea chasing a whale. Non-fiction can't do that in the same way. Speculative fiction is important too because we need to know about the what ifs and the maybe thens, play out all the possibilities.

What might be convincing is that fiction is the single greatest avenue for social change we have. Fiction allows people to examine moral quandaries from a distance. It depersonalizes the issue so that the reader/watcher can see the morals of the story without being involved with the issue. 

You can talk about slavery, racism, classism, and bigotry without having to talk about how specific real groups have benefited from the things. Fiction can create villians that enact these practices and fully explore the morality of them without ever having to say ""you are part of the system that benefits from these things"". Without making the reader the villian. 

But while it creates a barrier between the reader and the moral issue it creates connections between the reader and the characters. Readers become emotionally connected to the characters they read about, their suffering, their issues, and their pain. They sympathize with them. 

Our ability to create an emotional connection to a story is integral to our development into a decent human being, capable of sympathy, empathy, and compassion. And fiction is where that happens.

When it comes to reading, we may be assuming that reading for knowledge is the best reason to pick up a book. Research, however, suggests that reading fiction may provide far more important benefits than nonfiction.

Fiction tells us stories about how other people can live, shows us perspectives we might never otherwise see, which is the very basis of empathy.

I was taught about slavery in the US in my classes. But all I knew was facts. I could rattle off the year something happened, but what does any of that mean?

I think fictional books teach us emotions and empathy

If you read ‚Äúboy stole bread‚Äù then most people will just think well stealing is stealing. Maybe he was starving but a crime is a crime

The lecturer's angle is to look at it as a two-level theory. What we see (one level) is affected by natural laws (another level). And then we have these ideologies where they all tell you ""at one level humans are X and so we should organize society based on Y""

It doesn't sound mind-blowing, and when I revisited the lectures it didn't sound impressive, but the first time I heard it I jumped up and shouted ""that's exactly why I read fiction""

You can (and should maybe) travel the world, visit museums, greet the locals at the resort... Those are facts. I went; I actually saw and experienced it with my own senses. 

A year later as you look at the holiday photos, you are really telling a story filtered through whatever you are going through. Same with history or any other facts. Just read the newspaper or consume the news. **You aren't getting facts**

The journalist with her protective gear, in that particular street, using that particular body language, those particular metaphors is telling you a story. They could just give you the facts, but the never do. 

So even when you think you are getting facts, you are told a story. And, whatever sticks in our head, whatever we remember is based so many factors within the writen word and within our ideology. 

When I heard those lectures I thought there are three levels to the world: The scientific fact, the things we get through the senses, and the human brain. 

You can travel the world and if by magic you know the local language you can talk to that old woman, to that teenager, to that prisoner and so on. And that way you get the full nectar of life. 

Or read fiction!

When I read fiction, I know it's made up, but at minimum the person who wrote it and (Again at minimum) the people who thought it worth publishing are real! 

I'm a man in my 30s, not married, I don't see the point, I don't want kids... I just read The Days of Abandonment by Elena Ferrante. The characters are all made up, but there's something in Elena, and all the people that thought it is worth publishing (let alone of people that love it) that is just as real (or even more so) than a ""non-ficion"" 600-page book on how Hitler rose to power.  Those 600 pages would be 20 pages if it's purely non-fiction without a slight bit of flourishing.

"lx852wz","Alternative_Yard_148","2024-11-15 06:54:38 UTC","I agree with you!! I read both, and it seems stupid to judge them in a general way. Fiction is creativity. It's when we give way to another way of describing reality: I think, philosophically, fantastical stories, myths, and fables are very important for the progression of our thoughts. I think that if you free a story of our real world's limits, then you are able to delve into the unknown, in the more profound part of our existence.
I find this very interesting. It's kind of like how Plato used myths to explain his thoughts: symbols and fantasy are perfect to explore things that in our world would seem unclear.
Personally, I had the opposite issue because nobody in my family read particularly much, my sister read a lot but only fantasy books or comic books, and when I grew older I thought nonfiction was kind of non-readable, like it would be too boring and difficult, so I didn't even try. Then, for high school, I was forced to read nonfiction, and I started to love it. Some books were VERY intense. Now I mix the both, but I think I prefer nonfiction. So it seems weird for me that people display this ""discrimination"" towards fiction because nobody around me bothered with nonfiction for a very long time.

There are so many parallels to World War 1 in The Lord of the Rings. Margaret Atwood has famously said ""There's a precedent in real life for everything in the book"" about the Handmaid's Tale - which imo is why it's so powerful. To Kill a Mockingbird wouldn't exist as it is if Harper Lee hadn't grown up in Monroeville, been influenced by a 1936 event near her town, had a former lawyer as a father, studied law for several years herself, etc. And now we have more diverse writers writing from fresh perspectives we haven't been able to hear before. None of the authors I mentioned - J.R.R. Tolkien, Margaret Atwood, Harper Lee - could've written as nuanced and powerfully from the perspective of first and second generation immigrants in the US as Celeste Ng.

All of these authors pulled from real life and were able to create works that allowed us, the reader, to see things from a new perspective.

Good fiction books have a number of different merits. A good fiction book can help you discover a world, culture, lifestyle you have no understanding of. Depending on the fiction book, it can help you discover a world and time which no longer is. To Kill A Mockingbird is fiction and sadly, there are elements which happen in it which still exists today, but it helps one see what life was like not too long ago. Laura Ingles Wilder, author of the Little House on the Prairie books, Mark Twain, they receive flak for having language and attitudes which are reflective of the time period they lived in.

And sometimes, fiction can and even should be just an escape of reality. Even if it has a lesson, you should be able to read a book purely for the entertainment value. If you want to imagine you are a wizard at Hogwarts, go for it. I love the Harry Potter books. Imagine riding with Rohan into battle (love The Lord of the Rings). Needful Things by Stephen King can convey lessons about the human heart/character, but it is also just a really neat story to read. I did not read it to see what I could learn, I read it because it was a really great story. Sometimes life is so stressful, you want an escape from reality. You want to destress. Who cares if it is realistic or not (depending on your reading tastes, but I digress). 

There are a lot of non-fiction books which I do not personally think are worth the pages they are printed on. Does not mean they do not have any value or merit of course. So enjoy it.

It's someone‚Äôs actual life story rather than a made-up narrative.

That said, I‚Äôve tried reading a few fiction books based on recommendations from this subreddit. The first was *The Midnight Library*. To me, it seemed to suggest that depression is simply a choice. The main character, Nora, eventually changes her outlook after realizing she would have been unhappy even if she'd made the ""right"" decisions in life. It felt a bit oversimplified‚Äîlike the message was just, ""Nora, be happy because you'd be miserable anyway."" It is so predictable and has countless loopholes but even If I ignored all that and tried to get the final message, it is still so shallow.

The second book I read was *Siddhartha* by Hermann Hesse. In it, the author imagines what Buddha might have said during pivotal moments in Siddhartha‚Äôs journey. This bothered me because how can anyone claim to know what an enlightened figure like Buddha would have said or done? The author‚Äôs interpretation might mislead readers or give an inaccurate impression of how Buddha might have reacted in such situations.

Because ""you need to better yourself with each book or else what's the point"". I get a tiny nervous breakdown every time I think about this.

I think, with younger people who think like this, therapy might help, because thinking that you should not enjoy yourself through books, and that enjoyment is a waste of time, must be deeply rooted in some other shit.

At the time I was seventeen and having to take history at a different high school as my main one was a religious all girls' school - they did have a history department but not enough girls wanted to take it for the end exam. It was me and three other girls visiting to take lessons and we prickled him - ironically, none of us were religious, but he believed we thought ourselves holy than thou.

We were studying The French Revolution for our main exam. There were other girls in the class, a pretty even split, and he took great enjoyment telling us that we only showed up twice in this period of history: during the October Days and the assassination of Marat. 

Ignoring that that is simply not true, and just because someone doesn't show up in the official narrative of history doesn't mean they didn't play an important role, he was missing the entire point of the revolution and the impact that The Enlightenment had, not just in history, but how literature started to shape it.

Isn't it interesting that despite centuries of arguing about Absolute monarchy, the power of the church, religious torture, serfdom, infectious illness, economical instability and the protection over public accusation due to the speed at which it turns to witch burning, there was a panic over whether girls should read Gothic novels?

Also, life isn't just about learning facts. We're so entrenched in our individualistic societies that we've all become products, and if we're not actively improving ourselves and our job prospects it's seen as a waste of time. 

Fiction can be entertaining, but it can also teach you things you never otherwise would have known, and see the world through a point of view you would never experience. Just like movies - sure, you're probably not going to learn a lot from a Marvel movie, and you're there for a good time, but I would be amazed if anyone can watch Schindler's List and come away without a gnawing horror about the holocaust, and following the stories of individuals helps us understand those horrors in ways watching an arms-distance documentary might not.","lx2b66n"

Of course, if it helps people to read by improving their focus or just making the whole experience more interesting, great, but I, myself, don't see it as the reading ""default"".

I think it's completely okay to read the book, and let the feeling of the book stay with you and be the thing that you will remember, rather than the plot, all the characters, and every single detail. But this is my preference; I don't think there's a correct way to do it!

Personally, I think the fact that you're reading is amazing! Books are so magical. You are a reader, whether it be one book a year, one book a day, reading, annotating, listening to audio books, having a paper book in your hands or reading an e-book. Just enjoy the experience!

Even when I was getting my degree I never used highlighters and post-its and notes. Here's my trick, and I've done this for every book I read whether in school or out:

Get a notecard for your bookmark. Whenever you read something, anything, that strikes you as particularly noteworthy, write down the page number and a word or two as reference. Something funny, or profound, a beautiful turn of phrase, a reference to something outside the book, something that reminded you of something else... any time a book makes you think a thought outside of following the text, you can just note down the page. 

Years later it's a lot of fun to look at a bookshelf, pull down a book, find the notecard as a physical artifact that is proof *you* read the book, *you* had thoughts about the book, a snapshot of your psychology and who you were at the time - why did you find *that* passage particularly inspiring? - and gives you a quick index to anything worth remembering in the book. 

Some books required multiple notecards. Some were lucky to have 4 pages written down. But even a single reference, forgotten years later, can come roaring back when you look it up. It takes very little effort - carry one of those tiny pencils with you when reading - and you get 90% of the effect of the highlighters and post-its without physically ruining the aesthetic (and resale value, if that matters) of the book.

I try not to lend those cards out if people take books, but when people have ended up with the notecards, they've liked having them and it's a good way to spark a conversation about the book besides ""yeah I liked it okay.""","lx36wuj"

""Why Not? You Do."" The golem lowered his arm.

""What?"" snapped Moist. ""I do not! Who told you that?""

""I Worked It Out. You Have Killed Two Point Three Three Eight People,"" said the golem calmly.

""I have never laid a finger on anyone in my life, Mr Pump. I may be‚Äì‚Äì all the things you know I am, but I am not a killer! I have never so much as drawn a sword!""

""No, You Have Not. But You Have Stolen, Embezzled, Defrauded And Swindled Without Discrimination, Mr Lipvig. You Have Ruined Businesses And Destroyed Jobs.

Also it may be very boring, doesn't engage a reader as much as fiction does which eliminates all the teaching effects (no interest=no reading=no learning). Sure, it depends on taste.  And the last one: no one can objectively depict their emotions and thoughts, it's always an interpretation. Sometimes it is an interpretation of SOMEONE'S thoughts and feelings, sometimes (as in autobiography) -- of their own.","lx2v1uq"

Writing requires a) talent, b) having income enough to feed yourself while you are writing, c) desire to share your experience, and so on and so forth.
