If you don't like the writing style it's not going to work for you, because it is long. Personally I didn't mind, but I enjoy slow paced emotional journeys. What I do have a problem with is slow pace journeys where nothing actually happens, and it's all just naval gazey. But I didn't feel Sophie's Choice was like that. The characters felt very real and their emotions compelling; seeing them grapple with the continuing wounds from the trauma they had suffered... Yeah, I found it compelling from the start, and the ending absolutely ripped my guts out. 

And this is from someone who is not shy about disliking ""classics"" if they don't work for me. But this one did. 

Different strokes for different folks, I guess.",""

"lqaopbw","estheredna","2024-10-04 13:20:56 UTC","Have you ever read a book published in the 1970s that you enjoyed?   You calling a 600 page novel by an author who aspired to be a new William Faulkner  ""wordy"" makes me wonder what your expectations were going in. I don't mean this in a mean way, just. This is a theme-heavy novel, not a fast moving plot.

It's also very much a novel of the moment and harder for to relate to. When it was new, readers would have found freedom through sexual liberation themes relatable and exciting.  Remember they grew up in a time when religion was very prevalent and birth control made sex different than any previous generation. No AIDS or condoms.  Whole different world.

One main character is  a white guy dreaming of writing a book about a Black revolutionary.  The (white, male) author as hero was a romantic trope in this era in a way that seems silly today.

One main character is mentally ill and abusive, but in this era he was glamorous, exciting.    It's taken decades to stop normalizing those things, seeing the red flags.

One main character is a Nazi collaborator, full of despair, who we feel profound sympathy for.  This hit  different when your dad was a WWII vet.    I guess the closest corollary would be a book about 9/11 survivors today.

Whether this is a  great book or not, IDK, but it was a sensation when it came out, and I think reasonably so.  I don't think you're missing anything, I think you are just not the audience for it.",""

In this case, it was the view of the holocaust as a uniquely Jewish experience brought about by Christian antisemitism. The book shows that Slavs and anti-Nazi Christians were also placed in concentration camps and that a portion of the suffering was caused by Jewish prisoners who elected to assist the SS in running the camps in order to escape suffering themselves. I'm not saying that I agree with it.  It was very controversial when it came out. Also, it helps that it was adapted into a phenomenal movie.

"lqb8sqh","orbjo","2024-10-04 15:15:14 UTC","Austen is a great example.

Please read Jane Eyre after your Austen binge, and then Wuthering Heights.(by different Brontë sisters) 

You’re see such different uses of language that just sing, or crunch in amazing ways.

Dickens, Dostoevsky, Hugo, Joyce, Woolf, these are writers I love as a massive Austen fan","lqamvbg"
"lqanirk","siena_flora","2024-10-04 13:13:29 UTC","Oh no I believe I agree! I read novels avidly up until I entered college, from then until recently I virtually only read nonfiction. Now that I’m getting back into literature, and enjoying it tremendously. I am chronologically working my way through Jane Austen (just finished Mansfield Park) and in JA’s case I think it applies perfectly. We come to love Mansfield Park (the place) and Fanny dearly but is the ending terribly gratifying? Nope, it was highly predictable from the outset haha. But I’ll never forget the journey through MP and all the characters along the way.","lqamvbg"

"lqb66gv","adorablenightmare89","2024-10-04 15:01:02 UTC","True.  As someone who loves the film, the book was so disappointing. I hated all the characters.","lqb0kd6"
"lqark1h","evasandor","2024-10-04 13:38:36 UTC","I grabbed a copy of *Jaws* as a middle-schooler because obviously my folks weren't going to let me go see such a child-inappropriate movie, but reading is fine. Little did they know that I'd learn soooooooo much about how adults have smutty extramarital affairs. That's probably the plotline u/adorablenightmare89 refers to.

Also: did the same with *The Shining*, also learned a lot about how Stephen King writes naughty bits. (Actually these were probably good lessons. Eventually, kids gotta see the grownups for the messes they are LOL)","lqantyw"
"lqcjuxf","WendyThorne","2024-10-04 19:26:27 UTC","It has 2 missing plotlines:

1) The mob is involved with the Mayor's decision not to close the beaches  
2) Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife","lqantyw"
"lqembzj","adorablenightmare89","2024-10-05 03:27:33 UTC","I don't personally think it would work in the film.","lqd8qbi"
"lqbawga","Jarita12","2024-10-04 15:26:33 UTC","Vianne did not end up with Roux, he stayed with Josephine. But Vianne sleeps with him and gets pregnant with his child and then leaves. It is just so wild. I am not generally too fond of this behaviour in general (call me a boomer in this department :D ) but to get pregnant with your best friend´s boyfriend and leave is kind of screwed up. I guess what helps is that Roux or Josephine will never know, I guess :D","lqb8t8f"
"lqfujn7","Far_Administration41","2024-10-05 11:20:50 UTC","That is definitely not what it is about.  That just frames the real story of the past.","lqdeofy"

Which choice has she to make?","lqdeofy"
"lqiyxd1","over_jumpman","2024-10-05 22:14:24 UTC","Yeah and that's the beauty of it we can all form our own opinions 

He might be a sexist and also write sexist character","lqcb4tt"

"lqbqjaj","jehnarz","2024-10-04 16:49:49 UTC","There is never enough Victor Hugo love. The way things that seem unrelated come together in his novels is so satisfying.","lqb8sqh"

"lqdi8rr","Roseliberry","2024-10-04 22:46:05 UTC","I could not connect with Wuthering Heights so I should probably skip Sophie’s Choice?  I love Dickens though.","lqb8sqh"

"lqgkmos","_Alic3","2024-10-05 14:26:53 UTC","I mean, that is quite literally the plot haha. It's a bit of a spoiler if you advertise that it's a story about the destructive power of guilt.","lqfujn7"

"lqggll3","WendyThorne","2024-10-05 14:02:43 UTC","Wouldn't surprise me. To be totally honest, I never read the book. I heard about those plotlines and how the shark just sort of slowly dies in a super anti-climatic way and was like ""I'll stick with the movie.""","lqdxyt4"
