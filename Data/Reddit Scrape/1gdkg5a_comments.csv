I feel like there are a lot of young people out there (at least where I live) who, obviously, know what war per definition is, but they just cannot comprehend the effects it can have on people. For them it’s something that doesn’t really affect them directly, so they see no point in caring about it. I find this honestly quite sad.

There were some idiots in my class who were joking about the horrible situation in Ukraine back when everything first started. They didn’t take it seriously at all. It was at the end of the year so we didn’t have the time to read the book, but I remember one of the teachers going with us to the cinema under the pretense of watching a comedy movie. When we sat down, she told us that we’d be watching ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". She didn’t say anything else, no description, no nothing and the film started shortly after that. After that movie I’ve never heard one stupid joke or comment about wars in general ever in my class again. Some of my friends looked really pale and defeated after the movie, one of them even cried a bit. It definitely was a wake-up call. I read a few pages of the book and am planning on reading all of it very soon.",""

"lu5pfrw","Psittacula2","2024-10-28 11:18:02 UTC","\\>\\*”What books do you think young people should read and why?\\*”

There are a couple of necessary distinctions to make before answering the question.

1. Books chosen for young readers should be directly USEFUL.

2. This is a separate criteria to books which offer “great literature” such as writing quality, ideas explored or success of story-telling

3. A further distinction, books DIRECTLY assigned to a given young person from someone familiar to them as opposed to a standardized list of books for a school curriculum (aka “what society’s experts of education deem essential or good”). I flatly refuse to accept the latter as too arbitrary and in modern times to polluted by the poison of political interference. To the first criteria, not all books are always universally applicable to all young people. In fact only a vanishingly small number of books might be deemed suitable for broad recommendation, only.

As such for young readers I would start with:

\\* Aesop’s Fables

For older readers I would continue with a book from their own culture and language that lists and describes 

\\* Common Aphorisms & Traditional Jokes (as selected by an expert in the field NOT a so-called education expert or government related clerk)

\\* Common Folktales & Folk Songs (again of the culture and language and locality)

In each case, I would ask the young people to memorise these tales, then tell them and discuss them and perform them in the case of the musical versions. If the culture has a suitable Folk Dance as well as Instruments then to combine the musical learning with these sources and perform them also.",""

It also teaches us that we shouldn’t always blindly adhere to social standards and norms. Censorship and freedom of choice is also a major theme in this one,so theres a lot to be learned about using them both in the correct way.

To kill a Mockingbird - This one touches down on issues like Judging people by their character, being open to seeing things from someone else’s perspective, fighting for what you believe in (even if you know you will loose), and of course, it’s a good reminder that prejudices can exist in society and it shows the detriment they pose to communities

The Diary of Anne Frank- This one poses another reminder of the harm that prejudices can entail. Not only do we get the perspective of a young girls coming of age during the eye of a storm, but we also gain a lot of insights on the impact and devastation that the Holocaust left behind.

Unlike most other war books I’ve read, it shows every person as a human. (At least as far as I remember; I loved it, but I don’t want to read it again.)

Personally, the short story “Hands On” by Robert Shackley helped me understand that actions by other people may be totally understandable and reasonable in their situation. Just because I don’t understand it doesn’t make anyone a bad/crazy person. When I feel angry or weirded out by someone, I often think of this story and try to understand their point of view.

I also think that ""The Hunger Games"" is a very important series to read, as long as someone understands that it isn't really a love story. It actually contains really important lessons within an amazing story.

It is a story about two people who live with the shadow of the communistic past - were harmed by it. It is a detective story, horror story, a history and personal drama, all rolled into one

Their stories are mixed with (real) stories from (now uncovered) secret police files, telling life stories of women in prison in the 50s in the deep, dark communism. What was happening to them and their children is awful, yet true.

The ""Northern wall"" is a place at Prague cemetary where was a mass grave for these women and their children.

It is very terrifying, sad story but should be a mandatory read simply because the past is often forgotten and the more recent even moreso. Especially with the tendency of some saying ""oh, we used to have such a great life during communism!"".

"lu2uth7","Creepy-Skin2","2024-10-27 21:49:39 UTC","Anecdotally, I went to a very rural school in Montana that nailed Shakespeare. The school was k-8th and my year had 16 students. They set it up so 8th graders spent about a month reading various Shakespeare plays together aloud and then put on a production of Romeo and Juliet. Since none of us were actors and everyone was -forced- to perform, roles changed from scene to scene with the goal of most students performing the same amount of lines. In the week before our performance we literally -just- did this in school, nothing else. They’d bring in the 7th graders to run tech during this week and at the end we’d perform to the 5th and 6th graders and then our friends/family that night. 

I was a super shy middle schooler and it was still so much fun to ‘skip school’ and hang out with my friends in dresses and paint sets and stuff. More importantly, it exposed kids to a performed version of Shakespeare multiple times before they learned it by performing themselves. The school funneled into a much larger highschool in town and the English teachers there always knew if someone came from my rural school vs the towns’ schools because we had a much more nuanced/advanced understanding of Shakespearean language. It almost tricked us into being English scholars.","lu2g9h0"

“We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.”

It’s so profound, and incredibly applicable to so many things, small or large. I used to be a passive person who didn’t care for politics, and wanted an easy life free of drama.

I don't fully understand the teaching of Shakespeare in general.  When I was in high school, I had no idea what was being said in any of that, let alone recognize the iambic pentameter.  Learning the meaning of enough of the words to be able to understand a single dialog exchange can take hours, and you won't recognize the rhyme scheme unless you hear it pronounced the way it was pronounced at the time.  If any schools go through all that, my hats off to them.  Every school that doesn't do those things but still teaches Shakespeare is, in my own opinion, wasting their time.

If you always let kids pick their own books or only base recommendations on what they previously liked, then they may only ever read a narrow set of books and likely won’t expand their horizons very far (plus there are plenty of kids who wouldn’t read anything if left to their own devices). 

Also, this approach would be premised on the belief that reading should always be fun or enjoyable, ignoring the fact that, at least at times, reading should be difficult, challenging, uncomfortable, and unfamiliar. 

Lastly, there are plenty of books I read as a kid that I didn’t like at first, but they have become some my favorite books now—and I don’t think I would’ve ever picked them on my own (like *Wuthering Heights*, for example).","lu2tt2x"

"lufl149","alegonz","2024-10-29 23:11:08 UTC","I will tell you of the first time I read Vonnegut. I'd heard he was a satirist, and I wanted to know what that meant. So I read *Slaughterhouse Five*. I was in college.

I was amazed at the degree to which he was capable of presenting so many varied topics, and balanced them perfectly.

But the one that really got me was *Cat's Cradle*. I'd read apocalyptic fiction before, but this novel really captured the sheer stupidity of greed and corruption that leads to apocalypse as when I read this one.

TL;DR: Vonnegut is great at shining a light on human nature, and mocking it effectively.","luedd2z"
"lua52ae","RighteousSelfBurner","2024-10-29 01:47:41 UTC","This going to be an unnecessary harsh take but it's due to having a similar experience as yours and absolutely loathing it. 

I'm a massive reader and was one even during my teenage school years. However most of the mandatory reading was, and I can't bring myself to call it differently, intellectual masturbation. For example, I can understand using the local equivalent of Shakespeare to be used as language study. I can understand using classics to try and understand the historical context. However using classics to analyse literary structures,  characters, pacing etc. when you don't have that context is extremely jarring. And straight up annoying when you have already read recent works with same themes, plots, character types etc.

Because if you try to teach five part tragedy structure with a work whose archaic language you barely can read and historical context you barely can understand it seems to me is quite counterproductive in achieving the desired goal.

Now, I do understand why is that so. Some part of it is national pride. Some part of it is just inertia. Some part of it indeed is a slight personality cult and overvaluation of ""firsts"". And most importantly, it's safe. In the internet age of outrage someone will find what to be offended by any more recent work that is more accessible and with education sector already having struggles making waves for something that isn't truly broken is energy best put elsewhere.

That doesn't stop me from being frustrated about it though.","lu4k8se"

"lu2yr2h","BlackCatWoman6","2024-10-27 22:11:09 UTC","When I was in 8th grade, we would read Shakespeare in class with different students taking different parts. It wasn't as much fun as seeing a performance, but it was better than just reading it on our own.","lu2hd2g"
"lu2mcym","adamsilkey","2024-10-27 21:05:06 UTC","Well, Shakespeare is funny, and lewd, and dramatic, and inspiring, and thrilling, and, yes, he does have some absolutely magnificent things to say about the human spirit. But that's the juice on the inside, and you can't get to that juice if you can't get through the language. And because it's this old English... yeah it can be tough.

The best way to get through the language is to hear it being spoken and see it being performed. And even then, the language problems melt away when you see Shakespeare performed by good actors.

You don't need to understand a lick of French to laugh at the comedy when Princess Katherine is trying to learn English in Henry V, Act III, Scene iv. And we still don't need to understand French when we see her use the same words around to turn up the heat with Henry in Act 5, Scene 2.

Hamlet's soliloquies of despair and depression will be well familiar to many a teenager... and when performed by a good actor, they'll be able to feel that too.

English teachers want to talk about Iambic Pentameter and symbolism and the usage of language and the deployment of verse compared to prose because all that stuff is super geeky and fun. It's the reason they went and got an English degree in the first place, instead of doing something ""sensible"" like go to business school. Diving into all those nuances is wonderful, but it's not necessary, and either way it's like..... step ten.

Let's start by teaching teenagers to recognize the insults and the poop jokes and the bawdy innuendos. I think teenagers they're more than capable of handling all of the above. I mean... _Much Ado About Nothing_ is literally a vulgar pun about a woman's privates.

Let's immerse teenagers in a wonderful performance and then pick the best, exciting scenes and explain what they're saying. Any teenager can understand what's happening when they watch Tybalt and Mercutio clash swords and when Mercutio dies and then *Tybalt* dies and ... wait what were they saying during this ridiculously awesome stage fight? Let's break it down.

People need to laugh when watching Shakespearian comedy, they need to be riveted when watching a tragedy, they need to feel the anguish and heartache and hormones when watching the romances unfold across the stage.

_That's_ the entry point.

_That's_ how we should be teaching Shakespeare.","lu2ji7m"

Who Sank the Boat is about a series of animals getting into a boat. A horse, a cow, a sheep, a pig and so forth. Everything is fine until the mouse climbs aboard and the whole boat sinks. Was it really the mouse's fault? Or could it have been that there was such a big weight in the boat that it was never going to work, and the mouse was just the straw that broke the camel's back? The lesson being: the thing that causes the issue to become a problem is not always the underlying cause of the problem. 




We're just having a lot of interpersonal issues at work at the moment. While the proximal causes are obvious, the underlying cause is that everyone is simply at their workload capacity, and attempts to add additional surprise projects on top has just pushed everyone past their breaking point. This isn't unique to our workplace.




I think everyone knows the story of the old woman who swallowed a fly. We're going back a while now, but about 15 years ago, the Australian government was talking about introducing a kind of snake into Australia that is the natural predator of cane toads. Cane toads are a real problem in Australia, they were introduced to help control the population of the cane beetle, which was an unwelcome side effect of bringing sugar cane to Australia.","lu7y3ii"
"lu8d1x6","sirlexofanarchy","2024-10-28 20:02:56 UTC","King Rat is a novel by James Clavell, and probably one of my favourite books. It takes place in a Japanese POW camp (Changi) during the end of WW2. Clavell himself spent time in the exact prison camp where the novel is set and based one of the main characters loosely upon himself. It's a fantastic, grim depiction of the inner workings of a POW camp and what it takes to survive - and thrive, if you dare. 

I read it for the first time when I was fresh out of high school and it deeply moved me. I would maybe recommend it for 'first year of college' age. I think reading it around the age you'd potentially be drafted if you were alive during WW2 is incredibly powerful. 

You could have so many discussions around this novel. Why do we go to war? Who does it serve? Why were POW camps around, what purpose did they serve? Do you think that's moral, etc. Use it as a segue to look at WW2 propaganda. Place it within the wider context of WW2 and use it to make the whole thing less abstract to young people; to put a human face to it as it were. So much of what they taught us when I was in school lacked the human element, and I feel like this is a fantastic example of humanity at a very particular moment in history.","lu7xmxo"

It makes the world seem strange and new and it reawakens the curiosity about something we consider mundane and forget how to be amazed by.


How to Blow Up a Pipeline exposes how silly, short-sighted, the system that enables environmental destruction is. It makes a strong case to pursue the preservation of our ecosphere as a priority worth pursuing at almost any expense and talks about radical flank theory, which states that no significant change in society has actually come about without a palatable political front to represent it, and a radical flank that offers a violent alternative.


Braiding Sweetgrass is a series of reflections by an Indigenous biologist who urges us to imagine a world that is more compassionate and a society which is in harmony with nature.




The first book will bring amazement and curiosity, and make you appreciate that which we take for granted. The second will get you angry at the prospect of losing it and let you know that the anger is an appropriate and valid feeling. It will make you want to act. The last will offer hope and remind you that you will need a lot of love, openness, imagination and compassion to build a better world, and will urge you to dream it into being.

"luwxdvp","Ok-Account9401","2024-11-01 20:24:15 UTC","This is just a minor emendment.  But Shakespeare is early modern English, not Old English.   It is the same language as the King James Version of the Bible which was published in the same time era  of the early 1600s.   Until recent times, the King James Version was used in churches and in many circles it is still used.  Thus for those familiar with KJV, Shakespeare was immediately accessible.   Old English is pure germanic Anglo Saxon such as is used in Beowulf and perceded the Norman Conquest in 1066.  The Normans spoke French which became the primary administrative language of the land since the Normans were in charge.   However, Saxon (Old English) was still being used.  If you read Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe, you'll get a good feel for the conflicts between Saxon and French.  Gradually English began to emerge.  By the the time of Chaucer, Middle English had emerged.  I am all too familiar with Middle English and Chaucer because I took an undergraduate class in Chaucer in the 1970s where we were only allowed to read Chaucer in the original Middle English.   The professor said if he found us using a translation, he would fail us.  If you think Shakespeare's language is difficult, try the middle English of Chaucer.  The spelling is chaotic and it really is a different language, but accessible unlike old English.   Around the 1400s and 1500s, modern English began to emerge.  It has a Anglo Saxon base to it but with very strong Latin-language influence.   Also, writers like Shakespeare knew Latin and introduced Latin words.  There's much controversy over the authorship of Shakespeare.  I belong to the Francis Bacon Society and we maintain Bacon wrote them.   I myself as an adult have acquired a taste for Shakespeare and read a sonnet every day plus I've read several of the plays.  I also only read the KJV at home though my church uses a modern translation.  I love the Shakepearean, KJV early modern English.    There is a series of books of simplified Shakespeare that still uses the original Shakesperaean modern English but I don't have them handy to give a modern exact title.  Also, the Shakespeare festival in Ashford, Oregon is well worth attending to get the Shakepearean juices flowing.","lu2mcym"
