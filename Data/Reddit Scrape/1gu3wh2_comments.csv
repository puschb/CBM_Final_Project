"lxr04l1","A_Guy195","2024-11-18 13:03:03 UTC","My God, I’ve read almost everything Christie wrote I think. I can’t even pick one which surprised me the most.

I remember the twist in *A Murder is Announced* was quite good. It was such a convoluted story, with many suspects and motives, and then the ending was….well, let me not spoil it.

In general, you can't go wrong with Agatha Christie. She isn’t called the “Queen of Crime” for nothing. I know that Margery Allingham and Ngaio Marsh, who were active at the same time as Christie also wrote amazing detective novels, but I haven’t gotten my hands in them yet. Maybe you’d like to take a look.",""

I totally agree with this. Never was a big crime mystery reader as I grew up. Later I got hooked on the Poirot shows (with David Suchet) which got me into the books. Which led me to Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence, and Christie's other works. So much good reading.",""

Dan Brown's older works (angels and demons, da vinci code, digital fortress, deception point) had gripping storylines with jaw dropping reveals (his work become repetitive once you get used to the writing style, but initial novels were crazy)

And the OGs Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie's works, never had a dull moment. The grip they had on the teen me's imagination.....",""
"lxrjpl6","H8trucks","2024-11-18 15:07:32 UTC","I almost spoiled Roger Ackroyd for someone once! I went into it knowing the twist because it's one of those where if you've heard of it, it's because of the twist. I thought my coworker was in the same boat, so I started talking about how groundbreaking it was. He asked why and I realized he didn't know and had to rapidly backtrack... I think I ended up saying something about the first person and the angle on Poirot and how the narrator's sister was likely an inspiration for or early draft of Mrs. Marple. 

Speaking of spoilers, Agatha Christie also wrote a play called The Mousetrap that has an ending/reveal that is so non-spoil-able I believe there was once controversy over whether it should be mentioned on Wikipedia. You can find and read the script, and it's very good.",""
"lxrctu2","heliron","2024-11-18 14:26:53 UTC","Christie novels are such a treat.

"lxrp98b","Own_Art_2465","2024-11-18 15:38:17 UTC","I think a lot of people think Christie is going to be very 'basic' , and often with characters and places she uses very simple archetypes, but I once saw her writing compared to fairy tales- she has that power to tap into primitive fears and repeating stories that you also see in ancient myths and legends, she has such a great instinct for human nature and being able to flip everything. I did take that for granted in her until i read other mystery writers who couldn't come close in that aspect. People miss how funny her books could be as well.

  
Not sure which my favourite is at the moment, but if you like those big endings maybe try death on the Nile next (the novel version, she has a short story with the same title). I love her English summer books best probably.",""

It's mind blowing how good that book is considering it was her first foray into writing.

I fell in love with Poirot, and, to a lesser extent, Hastings, but the latter is absent entirely aside from a few mentions in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.

That's another unconventional thing she's done. ""The Murder of Roget Ackroyd"" is written far in the future of the previous Poirot novels, potentially his last case.","lxrq08b"

>I am sorry to say I detest Mrs. Ackroyd. She is all chains and teeth and bones. A most unpleasant woman. She has small pale flinty blue eyes, and however gushing her words may be, those eyes of hers always remain coldly speculative.

>I went across to her, leaving Flora by the window. She gave me a handful of assorted knuckles and rings to squeeze, and began talking volubly.

Agatha doesn't get enough credit for her comedic writing. I have found myself laughing out loud at times.

I also find it ingenious how much insight we're given into Sheppard's character with even Poirot remarking after reading his writing that he's much more forthright and honest about himself that he expected.","lxrthu2"

2. The Murder on the Links was great, but I almost feel like Agatha was too clever for her own good. The twists had twists and at a certain point it started to feel convoluted. It wasn't *bad* per se; it just felt overdone.
3. Poirot Investigates is a collection of short stories which were a mixed bag, some very good, some I'm surprised she wanted published. Didn't hate it, but it didn't feel representative of her immense talents.

There are so many double entendres throughout starting in the very first chapter, how he responds to an angry Roger, and so on. He then gives a ten minute window in which he could've committed the crime, we're told about the Dictaphone which enables the playback, we're told Sheppard is into inventing machines for a variety of purposes, Sheppard has no alibi, the only reason we think we know what he was told on the phone from the train station is his own words, we know he was at the scene of the crime both immediately before and immediately after the murder, we know he was left alone in the room where it happened enabling him to cover his tracks, we know about the moved chair which was apparently so no one could see the Dictaphone from the door, we know Sheppard had the medical bag so he could leave with said Dictaphone, we know he met with Ralph before he mysteriously disappeared, we know he ""came into a legacy"" while we're trying to figure out who was blackmailing and he never explains that further, we know all along he's uniquely qualified to be the one pulling the blackmail, stack that on top of why it was so important to him that Roger was getting a letter and what the contents of the letter were, and on and on and on. We're basically deluged with clues pointing to him--not to mention repeated insight to his character--while never considering it could be the main character, the narrator of the story. Agatha brilliantly played with our assumptions and it's obvious he's guilty from the first chapter.!<
