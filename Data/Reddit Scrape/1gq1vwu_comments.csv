"lwupv85","Uptons_BJs","2024-11-13 02:17:09 UTC","There's this chicken and egg problem that I've been curious about for a long time. 

  
You see, where I live in Ontario, we have this literacy test that every single student has to take (OSSLT). The ministry of education brags that every single student educated in the Ontario education system is literate, because they won't let you graduate unless you pass the test (or pass a remedial literacy course). 

  
Every year, they poll students on their reading habits before the test, and like, the results are miserable. Less than half of the students taking it report even reading regularly in their spare time (and they count social media reading, like you reading this comment as reading!). 

  
But something that I always found curious was the vast gender gap in reading. Girls seem to read 20 percentage points higher than boys do, and I always wondered - Was it because publishers don't publish books that appeal or boys? or was it the opposite? That boys don't read so publishers don't bother.",""
"lwuwqcl","Zapptheconquerer","2024-11-13 02:58:06 UTC","My favorite books as a tween were probably the Gregor the Overlander series by Suzanne Collins, the Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colder, and the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan. I don't really know what's popular among kids today since I don't have any, but I personally never felt like they're weren't books that were geared specifically to my demographic as a kid.

I think the issue is that books in general are just looked down upon as inferior forms of media among young boys as opposed to things like tiktok/YouTube. I don't think that's the only problem thats resulting in the lack of literary among kids, but it's probably the biggest.",""

"lwv4dr8","LadiesAndMentlegen","2024-11-13 03:46:48 UTC","I (27m) was once a teenage boy. I read very much as a kid, and continued reading as a teen, but it wasnt YA fiction. 

As a young boy, my mom would read to me every night, and we would take turns reading pages to one another before bed. Boxcar Children, Ramona, The BFG come to mind. As I got older, my interests in science fiction took over because they matched what was happening in my videogames. Star Wars and Halo novels were my bread and butter. It seems most boys skip stereotypical ""YA"" fiction and get funneled into either the sci-fi or fantasy pipeline. Another underrated and huge source of my vocabulary and comprehension was playing the videogame Morrowind and reading all of the text to move about the world and find my way. I started playing Age of Empire 2 as well, which cultivated in me a lifelong deep love of history. I remember checking out non-fiction books from the library on Ghengis Khan and the Spanish first contact with the Aztecs. That's when I wasn't sponging up Wikipedia links on historic figures and battles.

Once I got into high school, I moved into reading the classics. Doestoevsky, Bronte sisters, Tolstoy, Dumas. So much fun and also deeply meaningful. If you start measuring boys by YA fiction, though, I think you aren't really getting the whole story at all. It's amazing to me how few institutions seem to truly understand boys.",""

"lwvdzqf","lustywench99","2024-11-13 04:56:04 UTC","So I’m a high school librarian. I also work on a committee for a YA award. Of course I’m sharing my observations on my demographic. Your school experience may vary, but I’m there right now every day and I have noticed the shortage of books and readers. 

I will say, there aren’t a lot of straight white male narrator books coming out. I still see the straight white male (that doesn’t have anything perceived as “other” about them) in multiple POV books, but theirs is not the whole voice throughout the book. Sports books tend to still put out a few but there have also been fewer sports books overall and a bigger trend toward girls in sports. 

My male students who are readers enjoy Manga/graphic novels, Alan Gratz, Red Rising, Camp Valor, wilderness survival, sports, and mystery/horror. Most of my male students forced to check something out will either check out a large book (think It by Stephen King) and never even pretend to read it or look for something made into a show or movie or look for something they’ve already read. They make no qualms about the fact they won’t read it. I do have reluctant readers who will read if they actually are hooked by a book, Golden Arm, Camp Valor, The Unfortunates, and oddly enough Mindy McGinnis books (because she came in person to our school) have been the ones I get the most feedback about. 

I’ve also moved all the sports nonfiction to the sports fiction section. They’re all together in the same area. I’ve found it isn’t cool to “look around” the library so if you put it all in one place they’re more likely to find it. I’ve had a number of boys very excited about the nonfiction and ask me for more books like these and what they mean is nonfiction. I’ve tried this with other genres too, but sports is where it has taken off the most. Historical fiction and nonfiction WWII books have always had a small fan base and those readers typically did look for those in the nonfiction section, moving some over there hasn’t really had the same effect. 

But my overall observation is reading isn’t cool. The library and books are stupid. It’s stupid to be caught looking at books. It’s a shame, but even when I taught English and we had reading time the boys overwhelmingly did anything to get out of it. Bathroom, go to the library (and now on this end I see what they do when they come here and it’s not productive behavior) or anything else that will get them out of class. My boys who do read, and I love them and some play sports and have girlfriends and do all that, are still not who their peers would call the cool kids. I do have non white and non straight males who read and they’ve got lots of choices because a lot of times gender and race aren’t a driving factor in which books they’re interested in. Same with the girls. 

There’s a stigma, there is an overall goal of not doing and actively avoiding, there is also an underlying issue of lower ability leading to that avoidance. Those gaps have already developed prior to ninth grade. 

And I do have a lot of adult crossover books, but the thicker the book the less likely it will be checked out and actually read. I get a lot of recommendations on cool guy books from my husband and pass those suggestions along, but even the most curious teenage boy who might just want to read for once is going to face a more difficult reading level in adult crossover and that’s going to be an immediate turn off. 

It’s a multifaceted problem. I don’t think publishing more books would get more boys reading. I have something like 6k books, 11 books per student, and most of the newer books right up their alley aren’t checked out. If anything there is a market for YA quick reads featuring white males, because those would be of most interest, but I don’t think they’d be going to a bookstore to buy them, it would be primarily libraries like mine that would buy them. And that’s the issue for publishers. 

And just to add disclaimers on disclaimers, my whole job is to get kids to read. I promote the heck out of books, actively search for books they’d be more likely to read, promote books that are a little out of their comfort zone that they’d still like (Concrete Rose has done really well). I spend a lot of time looking at shelves with them. I film tiktoks of myself going through the shelves pointing out books and describing them so kids might see it and not have to deal with the “embarrassment” of the librarian helping them in person. I try. A lot. I have books on lower reading levels just because I know to meet them there. But not even the most savvy adult can overcome their perception of reading based on their peers. And not even the best book can overcome things like video games and phones. There’s a lot out there attracting their attention. Books aren’t one of them. But I do try.",""
"lwvyo8x","strange_socks_","2024-11-13 08:11:50 UTC","One issue surrounding this that always bothered me even as a little girl was that little girls read and watch and generally consume all kinds of media (on average). Like, I and the other little girls used to watch dragon ball z and other shows and read books with male main characters, or aimed at little boys, etc. But my brother was leaving the room when sailor moon was on. He watched a few episodes, so he knows what it's about, and that's it. And I can say with certainty that he never read a book with a female main character that was written by a woman or was aimed at little girls or women.

And I remember that this was the vibe growing up. If it's meant for little boys, it's a general kids thing that girls can enjoy too. If it's meant for little girls, only little girls consume it.

So I'm wondering is the issue with the publishing industry or with how little boys are socialized?! (mind you, all this that I'm talking about was happening in Romania in the 90s... I can't imagine the situation changed too much since then tho...)",""

Sometimes it wasn't a problem with said boy but the (grand)parents who were buying it.

So I was technically closed in the Harry Potter - Rick Riordan bubble, because of the PARENTS not publishing. 

Also parents for boys were more strict with going out from the age category. ( I'm not American, so I don't know your categories but we have 9-12, teens, YA ) if the boy was 12 there was no way to look at the books from the teens section (where HP is) or to show him Terry Pratchett (who is in the general Fantasy section) but for girls it wasn't a problem?

"lwv7kja","Ragefororder1846","2024-11-13 04:08:36 UTC","The publishing industry for teenage boys/young men is getting outcompeted by video games. Young men that desire to engage with narrative content have an extremely popular and engaging form of it that is heavily marketed towards them.

A great example of this is to compare *The Witcher* games with *The Witcher* books. Comparing at the year 2020, we can see that the books had [around 15 million sales](https://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2020/07/sales-of-witcher-books-pass-15-million.html) while the games had [around **50 million** sales](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1305779/the-witcher-games-sales-worldwide/)

It's very similar narrative content. The games are substantially more expensive than the books (especially when you factor in the cost of having a console/gaming PC). The books have had a **27 year** head start.

But despite all of these advantages, the books have sold far fewer copies because they are books and games are games. 

There is no way we can confront ""don't boys read"" without acknowledging that mid-brow to low-brow fiction for teen boys has been largely replaced by video games which offer the same or better narratives in a more engaging and social format.

"lwvcnca","myfeetarefreezing","2024-11-13 04:45:49 UTC","I’m a librarian in a single sex (boys) school for 13-18 year olds. There is plenty of fiction that appeals to teen boys, and it is great to see an increase in diversity in publishing - more female MCs, BIPOC characters, LGBT+ characters, neurodiverse characters, and so on. BUT when I look at what’s popular year on year in my lending stats, it’s the same series over and over (Cherub, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Gone series, Alex Rider) and that hasn’t changed for 10+ years. So while I don’t think boys are underserved overall in terms of publishing, I do feel like not a lot of new (or at least heavily marketed) books are available that appeal more across the board for boys. 

Boys can (and do!) read books with female m/cs, read books about romance, read books about people different to them, read books that are emotionally and intellectually challenging, and read books with pink on the cover. But, lots of boys self-identify as non-readers, don’t want to think too much when they need to choose a book, can be a bit scared of what might happen if they read a book with a “girly” cover, and want to read books about people who are like them, and are doing the things they like to do.

My boys tend to read a lot of non-fiction, especially biographies. I think this is because it’s easy to hook into an interest (like a sport or hobby) and read about someone who does that. Biographies/autobiographies are great, but I do think there is a real gap in the fiction market for books that tap into boys’ existing interests but also expose them to all the benefits of reading fiction. Shorter (200-300 pages) high-interest books (think rugby, basketball, hunting, mountain biking, football/soccer, adventure/action, gaming) which also sneak in other things (like negotiating friendships, a bit of romance, family life), and also feature diverse characters - that’s all I ask for as a boys’ school librarian.

There has always been a large amount of books, and other media geared towards boys. Literally some of the most popular children’s stories have male protagonists. Percy Jackson and Harry Potter, for example, and then things like LOTR and Treasure Island. Then you have books for teens and adults where you’re faced with a men writing women problem. 


Literally any boy that wants to read will read. Books have never been more accessible. I think they just prefer something else, and so long as they are literate, that’s fine. After all, do we ask “has makeup abandoned young men” or “why don’t boys wear heels like they used to”?",""

That’s it. 

I remember moving to Melbourne in 2000 and being genuinely shocked the first time I caught the train and saw men reading books on their commute. 

It had never even occurred to me until that moment that a man might read for pleasure. I felt like I was in the twilight zone! But boy, did I have massive crushes on those men; I thought it was hot as hell. 

From then on I met lots of men who did read, and it was always an excellent source of conversation on dates and stuff, so in my (limited) experience, there was definitely a city/rural divide. 

This was all before the invention of smart phones and I don’t commute anymore so I don’t know if men are still reading on the train!

Good books exist for them, but they’re nowhere near as prominent as other books.

I recall doing ""A Clockwork Orange"" for my open study in English GCSE at 15, and things like the Gormenghast Trilogy, some Kafka as well at the same time.

It was the same with my friends, we just read adult books, horror and SF. Mostly we were motivated to read about interesting stuff happening, rather than anything that was emotionally engaging. A book recommendation would often come via a friend saying ""there's this really good bit where \\[insert something involving a spaceship, some alien artifact or something gruesome happens\\]"".

Romance? We simply did not care about it. The books we read were about ideas, processes, unusual situations and problem solving. There were no love triangles or anything like that in the books we read, or if there were we'd just ignore/forget/skip past them.

As things are, I've been kind of bemused by the whole YA thing. I don't have kids of my own, but I'd suggest that most boys would probably be quite comfortable with standard, ""adult"" SF/Fantasy/Fiction and could quite happily bypass the whole YA thing altogether.

My parents ingrained in me that “reading was good” and because of this, I read a ton as a teenager. I remember my reading reducing a bit when I was in highschool, but this was due to reading lots of books for school assignments, such as works of Shakespeare, How to Kill a Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men, Lord of the Flies, Bewoulf, etc.

However, when the pandemic stopped, I started to read again and instantly fell into love with Stephen King. His books made me obsessed with reading, and I am currently at 60 books read this year. I think there is something about the way King’s books are written appeals to young men. He is such a unique storyteller.

I also got into Dean Koontz books, Nick Cutter, Richard Laymon, and other horror/male writers, as well as female writers such as Karin Slaughter, and Shirley Jackson. 

My point is, there are amazing books out there, and all it takes is to seek the stories out and find a way to submerse yourself into the plot, charcters, themes, etc. Having an upbringing where reading was encouraged definitely help.

Boys are no longer entering higher learning at the rates they used to, while girls are going to college at a startling rate (which is great). However, boys are being de-incentivized to read. They instead are being told that reading is for girls, because reading makes you feel things, and that's gay. Boys are being pushed into entering the workforce earlier and earlier by their peers and their parents; boys are being recontextualized as dumb and brutish, and influencers like Jake Paul and such are doubling down and telling boys that the way to get what they want is to demand it and take it by force. Girls are viewed as developing earlier and being more ""ready"" for higher learning than boys, and although there is a research precedent, this bias is carrying well into the post-18 years, far past when it's relevant.

This world is becoming more tolerant, yes, but we forget that it still sucks big time to be a sensitive, literate boy growing up in America (or anywhere). You're not allowed to read.

There needs to be a serious look at how the books in schools are chosen, and we need to get away from the traditional books read in school and start breaking out to other genres.

If more teen boys pick up reading as a hobby, the market will adjust to accommodate their tastes. Publishers didn’t abandon teen boys, teen boys abandoned books. And it’s not like there are no YA books written for a male audience—it’s just that the selection is more limited because they don’t sell as well. 

Edit: Think about video games for example. When they were first put on the market, video games catered pretty much exclusively to men and boys. Now that women and girls make up a significant portion of the market, video games are starting to cater more to that demographic. You see this reflected in character design, as female characters and avatars are less sexualized with more practical clothing. You see fewer damsel in distress types of characters and more female heroes. You even find more fleshed out male love interests if the game has a romance aspect.

A boy sitting down with a fiction book is a ""nerd"", and nerds are expected to be reading beyond their age level anyway, so adult fiction is okay for them (note that censorship in books is pretty strong here, so most adult novels will have little to no references to sex or violence). A girl, on the other hand, is supposed to be dainty and have soft domestic hobbies, which romance novels fit right in. We even have a fictional character archetype for this type of girl, Tatyana Larina, often remembered for her love of books and reading (the fact that the protagonist of the poem, the titular Eugeny Onegin, was also an avid reader, is oftentimes forgotten). Thus, the marketing companies have this stereotype that boys are harder to sell YA to, they are either already reading ""The Witcher"" or nor reading at all, while the girls are a prime market for romantic YA fantasy. Thus, most books aimed at teenage boys I see in our bookstores are video game novelizations and tie-in books, as well as books tied to the Internet and meme culture, because ""that's what boys like, video games and memes, right?"".

"lwzr83u","friedeggandchips","2024-11-13 22:30:20 UTC","I’ve found this conversation really interesting of late. For context, I’m a publishing person in the UK so have some inside baseball here.

Some thoughts:

If we discount external factors (rise of phone usage, competition from other media esp. games) I see a few key factors at play with regards to boy’s reading. And in short, yes, publishing has largely left boys behind. It really must change, somehow. 

Anyway.

First and foremost, publishing is a business. YA, fantasy, romantasy have been the big trends since covid, they’re all female focussed. Publishing is a trends game, that’s where the frontlist money is, therefore that’s where the focus is.

Second, social media plays a huge role in all book marketing and publicity these days, and TikTok has been massive for book sales in the uk. Most (not all) significant booktok people are female, and their audiences are female. Much like book influencers on Instagram or YouTube, most book content is ‘cosy’ and plugging into the themes already mentioned. It’s not a particularly boy-oriented space.

 There are basically no publicity outlets for kids publishing, so you’re relying on marketing. But: armeting budgets are very slim. Therefore you need a network of approachable influencers that are affordable and have a direct line to your readers. That exists for girls, not for boys. 

Thirdly, and I personally think this is far and away the biggest factor and the elephant in the room :the publishing industry is predominantly staffed by women. Childrens publishing is unbelievably female-centric. 95% female, maybe more, and I can tell you from personal experience there are very few men working in childrens publishing in the UK. This means all acquisitions are female focussed. Few people know how to market to boys. Dont get me wrong, there are a lot of brilliant, thoughtful women actively publishing books for boys, and genuinely invested in doing their absolute best in this area.

The problem is lots of childrens publishers simply do not know what boys want, and dont have the time or resources to find out. They’re currently making money with the trends mentioned above, which are showing no signs of slowing down. If you then factor in that lots of publishing is done on ‘gut’ (ie little or no market research, consumer insight, data, etc) and tastes develop fast, then you’ve soon got an entire industry out of step with what boys want to read, or even what would catch their eye in the first place.

I could go on and on about this honestly - there are lots of industries that spend a lot of time and money figuring out how to connect with boys in order to extract their pocket money. Publishing rarely works like that, apart from maybe at the very biggest houses, and even then the commercial imperative drives all. 

Sales teams work on a comparative basis (‘we should acquire and publish book a because this similar book b which pubLished last year sold well, therefore book a will too’) which makes it incredibly difficult to take risks on ‘books for boys’ when, as discussed, books for boys don’t sell. 

Publishers don’t seem to realise that boys are spending small fortunes on games rich in lore and detail. They love storytelling in other formats, it’s not like boys are immune to great narrative fiction. There’s just no drive to create the sort of books that can push the same buttons.

I think there’s a lot of… sniffiness too, for want of a better word. Childrens publishing is very idealistic and full of people who want to spread positive messages and make a difference. That’s great, but it’s also usually incredible dull and worthy and boring to read. Kids publishers don’t want to publish in areas that might connect with boys, therefore there’s not much for boys to latch on to, therefore there’s no market, therefore books don’t get acquired and the market sinks. 

It’s a vicious cycle, and I don’t see it changing without some significant industry wide shifts. Hand wringing won’t do it, it’ll take action. Some of the problems were facing are very much of the now, some are structural issues that desperately need resolving if publishing is going to advance into 21st century. It’s all a bit of a mess, honestly. 

(For what it’s worth, publishers don’t really know how to publish for men anymore either, especially in fiction, but that’s a whole other conversation).",""

"lx2dyew","SumbuddiesFriend","2024-11-14 10:17:59 UTC","This is a tricky one as boys who want to read never become YA readers as YA is very gendered to young women, and young boys being young boys don’t want to read about girls(unless you trick them like Skullduggery Pleasant).  So for YA to win over boys, you need boys to be the leads. Or you market them genre fiction early.


There is also a sadly a very solid notion with boys that they aren’t readers, reading is for the boys who don’t play football or video games. How we fight this is a hard one to grasp, as it requires fighting it at home as they are very young.
As far back as I remember I have been reading, and that’s because of one very important factor: I was read to and encouraged to read by my parents prior to any Schooling. To have teenaged boy readers, you must first have pre-teen boy readers, and to have them you have to have your young boys encouraged to read. That is how you fight the notion of “reading isn’t for me” in boys, you catch them before they even say the words.

TLDR; More boy oriented YA wouldn’t hurt. Boys need to be encouraged early",""

Boys get made fun of for doing “girly” things, and reading has become a “soft” and “feminine” thing weirdly. It’s a social problem, not a publishing problem. Teen boys would rather be playing video games or playing sports than sit at home reading, lest they be called gay. 

I think the reading thing is an example of a much larger problem. Boys do not do as well as girls in school, and more women are pursuing and finishing their post-secondary education than men. Academia, including reading of any kind, has become female-dominated. There’s a lot of sociological reasons as to why that is the case, too many for me to get into now. But what’s worrying is that time and time again, when anything becomes a thing that women/girls do predominantly, it becomes delegitimized.

So boys are refusing to engage with stories that don't have male leads and prefer stories that 'have boys in mind' whatever that means and somehow this is everyone else's fault, despite the fact that women and girls have been reading stories that are 'boy-led' for decades with no problems.

I only got a ""hip"" console when I reached high school and could finally afford a 2nd hand one, a SNES) and I didn't have the latest toys (a couple of random less-pricey Transformers or GI Joes here and there, nothing extravagant) so reading was the other option for me. And I've been doing it for so long it's become a habit so I have continued to read well into my adulthood.

But if I had other options as a kid, I don't know if I would have turned out the same way. Video games nowadays are easier than ever to access; you don't even need to have the latest tech to play a plethora of games. Movies are also easy to find, either through streaming or library DVDs or pirating. Back in my day, my local libraries only carried documentary videos, and if they had an actual entertaining movie it was a godsend (The Last Unicorn was one of those few movies my library had that I took out over and over again). Nowadays you pretty much have decades worth of movies available to you through a library card.

My parents never really pushed me to read. They're not even big readers themselves. I've never in my life seen my father read a novel, and my mother reads like 1 or 2 books every five years.

I got yelled at in elementary school for reading during lessons, I'd be reading my book while walking between classes, and in middle and high school I'd be reading in class because the course work was easy. So, big reader here. By the time I was 17, I would routinely read a book in one day.

By all means, young boys also deserve books that speak to their souls, their experiences. It sucks to see this level of disengagement. It is hard to find a variety of relatable content. At least on the same level as female geared content. 

That said, books for boys do exist. Graphic novels and manga tend to be popular. Which is by all means welcoming. 

Do you think we should shift towards more boy-focused YA?  
Or maybe even provide grants to Authors to fill this gap?

That's no knock to my parents at all because they **strongly** encouraged reading. They tricked us into thinking reading was the greatest thing of all time and they loved taking us to the library to get free books (mostly because we were poor)

And I read like crazy until middle school. When I hit middle school, I didn't touch a book for fun until college. The reason: computers and video games.

I'm not too surprised that young boys aren't reading that much because reading is actually *kinda* boring compared to everything else you could be doing in that same amount of time. People on here won't really understand it because their story is that they've either always read or always wished they could read more, but from my perspective as someone who always read... I realize I only did it because that was all I had. There was 0 reason to read after I found other things that were more fun

Now, my reading level was never ever low and I've always done well on anything reading related. And even now, I'm learning another language and my reading level is pretty high in that as well. I've come to learn to read again as an adult

When my son was in primary school I also noticed a depressing amount of gatekeeping around gender stereotypes. If little boys hear over and over again that there are 'boys' books then when they get older and there are just 'books' they're going to struggle.

There are Young Adult books that are geared for boys. They aren't as popular as ones written for girls. 

But what are boys reading? Comic books and manga. Comic books are rarely adapted to novels or vice versa, **But** many manga are adaptations of population light novels; Japan's version of Young Adult books. 

Popular Light Novels these days are:

● **Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation**. This series has 26 volumes of the main story. It's an isekai¹ where a 34-year-old NEET² dies trying to save a group of teens. He is reincarnated in a (now common trope) medieval European type society. As a newborn, he recalls his previous life, and hasn't mentally made the connection that the woman breastfeeding him is his new mother. Because of that, he enjoys feeding time a bit more than a normal baby would. The series is controversial because the main character is written to be a real POS before he's reincarnated. He's not much better after reincarnation, but he at least tries to be better than his previous life. The haters of this series have never even read the books, much less the manga or watched the anime that were based on it. It's recommended for readers 15 and older.

● **That Time I Was Reincarnated As A Slime**. 30 something salaryman³ is killed by a knife wielding mentally unstable person. He is reincarnated as a slime. Again with the Euoropean medieval society.  

Here is [a list of popular Light novels.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_light_Novels. The 2 I mentioned are ones that I now have in my personal library. 


# **NOTES**
1: ""Isekai."" A story that takes place on another world. Two American novels that used this premise are ***A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court*** and the ***John Carter of Mars*** series. There are generally 3 ways that the characters get isekaied. They stumble into a space-time warp, are summoned by magic, or the character dies and is reincarnated in another world. It can be through illness or accident. 

2: NEET: short for ""Not in Education, Employed, or in Training."" It is usually associated with a ""hikikomori,"" a person that has voluntarily become a shut-in and rarely, if ever, leaves his room. Most are also ""otakus,"" boys that are heavy into manga and anime. 

3: Salaryman. Office worker in Japan.",""

If I recall correctly, video games used to be roughly 50/50 split.

Boys won’t read books if there’s a girl protagonist, and it starts super young. I would be recommending books to parents and they’d tell me that flat out. Boys as young as 6. We socialise boys in a way that gives in to their demands, and we don’t with girls, so girls read more widely reading books of all different perspectives, which makes them more likely to be readers, So when they get up to YA, the market sees that. The older you get, the more the publishing market feeds into demand. 

Not to mention, a lot of masculinity is socialised by being in opposition to femininity. Which further drives boys away from books with female protagonists, something that girls have no problem with, despite being constantly told these books are not “for” them. 

The children’s book market used to be dominated by books with white male protagonists, because the market used to play into that mindset that that’s what boys read, instead of forcing on the real issue. There’s been movement towards more diversity, because it’s been recognised everybody deserves to see themselves in books. That has been more successful in the children’s market because there’s always been more of a sense of social responsibility in publishing when it comes to children’s books vs adults.

If parents actually took the time to teach their sons the value of reading from others perspectives boys would have more satisfactory reading lives. If we as a society tackle the racism and misogyny that starts young, it opens up the options for boys at a young age, and cultivates life long readers.

"lwysvmf","ragnarok62","2024-11-13 19:34:49 UTC","There’s a very simple solution: Make books about subjects boys want to read AND stop forcing them to read books intended to weed the “toxic masculinity” out of them.

The cratering of boys’ interest in reading correlates perfectly with the forced move in educational circles to books deemed essential by people trying to push a so-called “woke” agenda. 

When I was a boy and a youth, we read books like *Call of the Wild*, *White Fang*, *The Red Badge of Courage*, *The Old Man and the Sea*, *My Side of the Mountain*, *James and the Giant Peach*, *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*, *The Chronicles of Narnia*, *The Lord of the Rings*, and *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*. 

These were books about masculine adventure, courage, strength, sacrifice, religious faith, and even humor, many with a fantastic or epic scale, and also personal tales of inner journeys toward maturity and worth in society at large. 

Instead, today, female protagonists dominate stories and many of them seem exactly like boys or young men, giving boys no clear understanding of why men exist or what they offer that is unique to the world. Sex dominates a lot of today’s YA books, something almost entirely absent from the old classics (except in a chivalrous way) and that updated sexuality sends confusing messages.

The themes once essential to books for males are all watered down or jettisoned entirely in favor of messages that conflict with the messages and themes of those older classics, feminizing men and handing over what is traditionally thought of as masculine traits to female protagonists, leaving boys with no domain that is wholly theirs.

No one should be surprised then when boys reject books that lecture them that what they like is unacceptable, that all their adventures are of the wrong kind, and that they’re not as smart or as capable as their female peers.

More new male juvenile and YA titles need to revert to the kinds of books Jack London, Edgar Rice Burroughs, H.G. Wells, Roald Dahl, C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien,  and Brian Jacques wrote. Maybe then boys will read them.",""

Main POV is a girl, and the enemies to lovers romance has more appeal among girls than boys.

I branched into Harpers, Ravenloft, etc.  Then started moving to more contemporary fantasy, like Lord of the Rings, Dune, Ringworld, etc).  It got to the point where I would read anything I could get my hands on.  I even read my mothers (school) medical books out of sheer boredom.  The classics had a different style to them.  Mysterious Island, Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, Pride & Prejudice, Gulliver's Travels, etc.  They all had some sort of social commentary hidden within the words that sort of gave you an idea of the times they were written.  They meant something.  Sure, the D&D books didn't always have stuff like that, but they still tended to have some form of moral or least ethical message (good guys defeating bad guys.. that sort of thing).

Publishing has absolutely changed in that the books that I used to read seem to be the exception to the norm.  Harry Potter, while fun to read, wasn't exactly taxing on the imagination.  Percy Jackson honestly felt like an attempt at capturing the hype of Harry Potter.  Don't even get me started on Twilight.  These were the ""hit"" books of the new millennium.

I would guess STEM initiatives and authors actively trying to write more books geared towards children of all ages that girls just gravitated to it more.  I see a lot more chapter books geared towards kids now then I remember growing up and it's a good mix of targeted for boys/girls/neither.

My daughter is in 3rd grade and is reading chapter books that interest her like Percy Jackson and Wings of Fire and asked me what books I read at that age.  My response was that in 4th grade my teacher posed q challenge to get everyone reading, and reading different things.  For the boys every Baby Sitters Club book you got extra credit, and I struggled to recall what the girls were asked to read (probably hardy boys) because I don't remember many of the boys reading anything at that age.  I was an outlier in my class in that I started reading fantasy/sci-fi books the previous summer and in 3rd grade I was just reading Bernstein Bears.  
In middle school most of my friends read heavily but we were all the nerds and geeks who also role-played, played videogames, read comics and  played board/card games (i.e., Magic).  Most of my peers were just not into those and had more outdoor or sports hobbies.","lwupv85"

Yet, as you have stated, men aren’t as literate. 

For America, we just elected someone who is known to not be well literate. Men can get by for not being literate. If a woman is not literate she can only be a stay home mom and that’s it.

Reflecting on the books I (late 30s/early 40s male) read in elementary school here in the States thanks to the focus on Newbery books, I gotta say I remember mostly reading books with female protagonists. Not that that stopped me. A good book is a good book, and a good book will give readers something to identify with even when they're not reading, er, *themselves* in it. I even recently ordered a couple of books I remembered fondly to revisit them, and whaddaya know, female protagonists haha.

But then again, I've always been a big reader, rarely without a book in hand during my down time even now (*neeeeeerd*), so perhaps I'm an outlier. Though I will say the series which were popular at the time, particularly Goosebumps and Animorphs, seemed to have a little something for everyone, and a little insight into publishing thanks to several friends in speculative fiction makes me think it's publishers trying to figure out ever more laser focused ways to market books in a competitive and expensive scrum which is the limiting factor, not kids' willingness to read experiences outside their gender or race.","lwupv85"

Or a teacher taking away Lord of the Rings and trying to make me read Who Has Seen the Wind or the Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz. I later learned to appreciate those books, but younger me wanted unabashed heroism. But the curriculum said ""make them read Canadian fiction"". I did read Canadian fiction, but a lot of teachers were uncomfortable with L.M. Montgomery or Farley Mowat. They wanted me to read stuff that was ""relevant"" and I wanted to escape into fantasy. In later years I had to really argue with the school over forcing sexual assault victims to read A Handmaid's Tale. I was the one dealing with the emotional pain it caused, the teacher preached at me about social significance without remembering his students. Is that the only book available? You gotta show ID to get into a strip club but the teacher willingly reignites sexual trauma in minors as part of his agenda. 

Point is, the school system loves to force kids to read the ""right"" thing. And generally speaking, guys are better at saying ""fuck it"" and walking away.","lwupv85"

I'm in my early 30s and have constantly had guys telling me that I don't read the ""right"" things or tell me that I ""should be"" reading other things.  Those things tended to be higher level books about philosophy, classics, and non-fiction, and a lot of stuff that I honestly often just don't find as engaging as what I do prefer to read (there are certain things in those genres I do enjoy, but a lot of what I'd get shoved at me had awful themes/treatments about women that they'd just handwave and not even want to discuss).  The weird thing was that they so often didn't actually seem to even like the books or *enjoy* reading them themselves.  It always felt like they were reading them out of some bizarre obligation or simply for the image and being able to say they'd read them.  I'm all for getting out of your comfort zone and reading about important and sometimes uncomfortable topics, but this wasn't that.  There are a lot of books that they just refuse to read based on the topic being ""controversial"" in ways they're against or simply because the main characters don't reflect *them*.  But a lot of younger boys don't want to read big books on philosophy and economics, but they're being told that they're just wasting time reading novels aimed at their age group/reading level.

An ex of mine and I got into an argument about a very similar issue with video games where he doesn't like to play games that feature anyone who pretty much isn't a straight white male (which I didn't find out until several months into dating him) and was convinced that they weren't being made ""for (white) guys"" anymore, that everything was just catering to minorities and women now.  I pulled up several statistics that showed that that wasn't only *wildly* untrue, but that they made up the *vast* majority of the most popular titles every single year I checked, and I still wasn't able to change his mind or have a productive discussion.  Simply reading/playing what you want to enjoy and being willing to read about characters that don't look just like you is looked down upon by a lot of guys and they're eating up a narrative telling them that everyone is now ignoring them.  And the men that I know now my age that act like this are the men now that young boys are looking up to and learning from.","lwuwqcl"

The market usually responds to what is selling and just keeps making more of it.. but I really don't see any 15 year old boy trying to find a book that has a 15 yr old hero they usually want something that's cool and badass with lots of action.

Luke Skywalker and Hans solo? Grown men.

"lwvmzlk","Paldasan","2024-11-13 06:11:53 UTC","Boys fall behind particularly in literacy early for a number of reasons. These include starting school too young. Boys brains develop more slowly than girls brains and putting them in school as soon as possible puts them in a position where the just aren't capable of learning the required material. Waiting a year closes most of the literacy gap. Compounding this boys are also less likely to have a basic level of skills like knowing the alphabet or even how to write their name by the time they start school unlike girls of the same age.    
Once at school boys are still often expected to learn in a style that doesn't work for them but does work for their teacher and the majority of girls, that's the sit quietly and listen style where most boys learn better when there is some sort of movement incorporated. This has slowly begun being added to teaching curriculums over the past 15-20 years but actual implementation varies.. Having the students minds engaged in a way that helps them not only improves their development it also improves their relationship with the tools of education, namely reading. It becomes less of a chore and they are more likely to be interested in reading outside of the times when they have to read for school.

These are both well understood factors in education and have been known for decades Other factors like using analytic phonetics instead of synthetic phonetics have had a greater impact but should be mostly out of the education system by now.","lwuofck"

And once the boys get it into their heads that reading is a girls’ thing, it’s hard to convince them otherwise.

I think the underlying aim is to break down the barrier a lot of kids face of hating reading. If you are always stretched at reading (except you see the smart kids not struggling) maybe you internalize a dislike for reading and that carries through to teen and adulthood?

I still see the straight white male (that doesn’t have anything perceived as “other” about them) in multiple POV books, but theirs is not the whole voice throughout the book.

Genuine question: Is this a *vibe you are feeling*, or have you actually sat down and counted:

* How many books have single male narrators
* How many books have single narrators who are *not* male
* How many books have multiple narrators, of whom a *majority* are male
* How many books have multiple narrators, of whom a *minority* are male
* How many books have multiple narrators, of whom *about half* are male

If you have, I would love to see how the numbers actually break down. If you have not, I strongly encourage you to do so, because women (and nonbinary people) are routinely perceived to be taking up much, much, much more space than we actually do, because people are mentally calculating vs. nonexistence rather than our fair, proportionate share of attention.","lwvdzqf"

I understand perfectly well that books featuring, among other things, sex with farm animals, are not considered to be YA fare.

At the same time, I can't help but think that this book perfectly captures the mindset of today's young adult males regarding women, adults, fun, life options, school, responsibility, and feckless parents.

I'm currently trying to get repped for science-fiction novel series. Almost every literary agency I'm querying right now is making Romantasy and LGBTQ content their priority because that's what is selling. Mentions of YA work tend to be more romance, drama, and light fantasy geared toward women. In addition to this, the agency's demographics look pretty similar to their client lists and the types of books they decided to represent. There's a lot more women working as literary agents than men, and when you look at a list of their clients, usually it's a disproportionate ratio of women to men. As an example, one literary agency I looked at had a list of sixty five authors. Only two were men. The agency's literary reps were all women.

This is not me complaining, as women are the larger consumer base for books as of this moment so it's natural that this is how the market would be shaped, but if more men like myself are to come into the market to try and make content for young men and men, we need to be given the chance to do so.","lwuvseq"

Many of the biggest “booktok” sensations are by women who self-published and self-marketed first, or accumulated fans on fan fiction platforms. 

Now there is a new problem - female authors are being pushed into YA even if they want to write adult fiction and it’s really hard to break in if you don’t want to write YA or romance. 

Businesses are rarely interested in taking risks. They want to go for the sure thing and are usually reactive instead of driving the next big thing. 

But these days with technology and platforms available to everyone, there’s opportunity for those who are savvy at using the tools and marketing themselves to find their audience and for the luckiest ones, go “viral” and get a mainstream publisher to buy in.","lwuowtq"
"lwuv7s8","alanna_the_lioness","2024-11-13 02:49:03 UTC","You're right, this is a tough sell querying right now. YA is overwhelmingly read by teen girls, as this article examines, and, increasingly, 20s/30s women (which is a problem in itself and is detracting from books aimed at actual teens). The modern state of YA (mid-2000s to present) has always had a strong female lean, largely because, as this conversation touches on, teen boys either a) don't read period and instead trend toward sports, video games, and visual media, or b) aren't reading YA. (There's a reason why, when people on writing subs ask for comp titles for a YA fantasy with a male lean, the only suggestion they tend to hear is *Sky's End*.) Male MCs do best in an ensemble cast or if the MC is something other than cishet and white. Or, if that's not the case, hit on other age category staples, like a romance through-line. 

This said, a lot of writers do themselves no favors with a query package that is an auto-reject for reasons other than plot. If you haven't joined us on r/pubtips for trad pub discussion or to get your query critiqued, I recommend it.

Edit: and since it came up, self-pub isn't great for any kind of kidlit because teens don't tend to have credit cards and thus don't buy their own ebooks. (I realize this does kind of negate my point about adult readers of YA, but they tend to stick with trad pub releases as well.) And no, as someone implied, trad pub doesn't require writers to do 100% of their own marketing.","lwuowtq"

You don’t walk up to the counter with your book and go “hi, please put me down in the database as a 16 year old male buying this”. Otherwise it’s just sales isn’t it? And you could say more women are buying books because books directed at girls are selling more, but if all we have are books directed at girls then they’re by default gonna sell more than books directed at boys? I think the problem is, is that boys are wanting to read but struggling to find anything directed at them because the YA market is oversaturated with female coming of age and chosen one stories. So boys have the option of a small handful of MMC stories and then an entire sea of FMC stories. If they buy and read all the MMC ones, then they’re left with the FMC ones and thus they contribute to the FMC market except it might be more out of necessity than desire. 

There’s definitely a huge gap in male-centred stories in YA, NA, and similar genres. It should be a solid 50/50 but it feels much more 10/90 really. Off the top of my head I struggle to think of any male-centred stories other than Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Red Rising, and the like.","lwupmec"

"lwuv3kc","AVE_CAESAR_","2024-11-13 02:48:22 UTC","Two diff demographics with differing tastes. Im not as a guy, gonna be a stickler to gender norms, if I like a trope that is usually for girls, I will read works with it and idc what anybody says. BUT, the tropes I like disproportionately end up being the commonly male ones. For example, I love the Abrilliant Strategist archetype. Absolutely adore characters like Thrawn. So when a character acts in the exact opposite way I find them annoying. In the Hurricane Wars the FMC is exactly like that, extremely bratty over a betrothal that would avoid war and give her the political power to reform the Empire she opposes in whatever way she wants. Instead of taking this opportunity she acts rude and obstructive in meetings, and just makes life worse for her Queen Grandmother. That character is an archetypical Strong Female character that I’ve seen girls(Reylo fans in particular) praise. 

I don’t dislike Hurricane Wars’ FMC bcs “woman” or something, I dislike the FMC bcs their character was meant to appeal to tastes that are completely alien to mine. The reality is that the difference between books for men and women vary more than simply which gender is the MC. The tropes they employ, the type of stories they tell are very different, and while some works are able to thread the line, most in YA don’t even try anymore.","lwuq803"

It's hard to see the issues in younger cohorts while that remains the case. 10.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women, 2.7% of venture capital dollars went to women founded companies, 25% of senators, 29.2% of Congressional Representatives, the country has never had a female president.  
   
But we're talking about kids here and we need to disregard the part of society that is still highly male dominated. Especially, even if business wise young women read more than young men, we should still be producing stories for those young men to ignite their imaginations and their senses of wonder. As has been pointed out in this thread, in children's books, there's actually a really good gender balance, but as soon as it hits young adult it's entirely female dominated. Manga was a good mention in the article as it is a fairly male dominated medium, especially in terms of licensed manga. The same can be said of light novels of Japanese origin and what gets licensed. But I really think publishers here have a duty to publish more towards young men and school libraries should be buying and encouraging reading them. Sky's End was a good start and I hope it's good sale numbers will show that there really is a market for targeting young men with books. But I hope to see more going forward as well.

Granted, this is also when only talking about novels. If you start to include graphic novels and manga it gets much more difficult to talk about. I would agree that more positive depictions and books that reflect masculine interests in novels would be nice though.

*There’s also the issue of having teenagers try to be engaged in things like reading, when it is a time when most individuals have so many choices and changes they have to keep up with.

It’s okay to write a book for young boys, they’re not going to end up problematic because of that. I’d hope people would learn something after the disaster last Tuesday, it’s possible to do something nice for men without having it being patriarchy.

The video game industry used to be dominated by women programmers before the great video game crash decades ago. Then when the industry tried to rebuild itself they decided to target children instead of adults, but since retail stores had different toy sections for each gender they had to pick a gender to cater their games to, so they picked boys. And they stubbornly stuck with that strategy even after that was no longer an issue and stores had their own electronics section for games.

But despite the gaming industry heavily targeting men for several decades, surveys have found that an equal number of men and women play games. Also despite the perception of games being for kids the age of an average gamer is in their mid-30's.

This is an interesting example because there's actually a ton of anime and manga that *are* targeting female audiences. Serialized manga are typically published in magazines with a target audience, some of the more common being shounen (younger male), seinen (older male), shoujo (younger female), and josei (older female). These groupings don't really correlate to genre, either. You can have a shounen romance or a shoujo high fantasy epic, even if there are certainly trends with which kinds of content are most popular with which demographics (very few shounen office comedies, for example).

If you were a western fan in the pre-streaming era, you pretty much consumed whatever you could get regardless of which bucket it fell in—you didn't have the luxury of choice because so little got licensed for western release. Your stereotypical anime fan may have been a nerdy guy but he was almost certainly consuming at least some media targeted towards women or girls. Now almost every new series gets picked up by some streaming service and they've all long been available on the high seas and that crossover is no longer happening as often.

I would say this depends on setting, to a degree. Characters don't need the latest iPhones, as another comment suggests, but an ostensibly modern setting with smartphones inexplicably absent *does* stand out. A number of classic plot devices widely used for creating low-stakes drama in 90s/00s fiction (and earlier) are much harder to use effectively in anything set more recently than 2010 or so. If a conflict could easily be resolved with a quick google search or a text but isn't, there needs to be some kind of reason. That same problem doesn't exist in the world of fantasy, sci-fi, or really any other non-contemporary genre fiction.

When people talk about recent works having aged poorly, I think they're generally referring to works that are generically contemporary in setting but clearly lacking basic modern technology (especially where that tech would have straightforwardly resolved some kind of plot conflict!).","lwv16fn"

Being able to put yourself in a male lead's shoes as a woman, or a white lead's shoes as a POC in a POC minority country, etc etc, is seen as 'normal' - because those are 'default people' to the majority-group.  Whether or not that group actually outnumbers the rest.  It's a survival tactic more or less to learn how to cope with the majority group's point of view.

Putting yourself in the position of a minority group feels a little weird if you've always been catered to by being the default.  However, you can get out of that with exposure, and to be a good critic of writing, you NEED that extra exposure to give you the rational tools to interpret literature.

Sex is an embodied phenomenon (with social repercussions), so empathy is necessarily limited. People can *try,* sure, but they will never truly ""get"" what it's like to be the opposite sex. The most promising avenue to get boys reading, generally speaking, has always been to direct them to heroic male protagonists, usually in the context of some sort of violent struggle against a villain and / or nature. Literature from the classical period, or literature that invokes it, tends to be perennially popular among boys for just this reason. That may be problematic in some people's eyes, but if it's solely about getting boys reading more books, that's the most reliable avenue. When I was a kid I typically preferred realist fiction - gods, wizards, and that sort of thing bored me to death - so I guess I'm somewhat atypical in that respect.

Blood, violence, swearing, high intensity stuff.  There's no way any YA book would be seen as masculine or ""boy coded"" unless it matched that energy.

I remember my parents got me Tomorrow, when the war began.

>The term “young adult” was coined by the Young Adult Library Services Association during the 1960s to represent the 12-18 age range. Novels of the time, like S. E. Hinton’s “The Outsiders,” offered a mature contemporary realism directed at adolescents. The focus on culture and serious themes in young adult paved the way for authors to write with more candor about teen issues in the 1970s, Cart said.

>The first golden age is associated with the authors who the parents of today’s teens recognize: Judy Blume, Lois Duncan and Robert Cormier. The young adult books of the 1970s remain true time capsules of the high school experience and the drama of being misunderstood. Books like Cormier’s “The Chocolate War” brought a literary sense to books targeted at teens.

>But once these books devolved into “single-problem novels” – divorce, drug abuse – teens grew tired of the formulaic stories.

Boys are encouraged to do well in school… so they can do sports. This does happen with girls too, but it’s a lot less common. Sports very quickly becomes the focus for young boys once that option opens up. Parents don’t really help with this either because they usually encourage any and all extra curricular activities. What this does, however, is take away any time that child might have to actually read.

Now there’s practice and games. There’s travel. Why read a book when you have plays to memorize or tapes to watch? Why read a book when you know you’re going for a football scholarship? I can see why boys aren’t interested.

Now that I think of it, there was one YA series I was very infatuated with in elementary school called the Grey Griffin series, but in recollection, everything I read was an infatuation in some way or for some reason. I went through a weird phase in middle school where I was absolutely obsessed with the Mongol Empire. My mom thought it was the funniest thing, but she kept checking out books to keep me engaged and reading.

As for what fiction boys actually enjoy, I distinctly remember Lord of The Flies being an unexpected big hit among boys in my class. Hatchet as well in middle school. Even plays like The Crucible were weirdly very well received, if you can imagine a bunch of boys putting on accents and getting into character. I remember a lot of my male friends getting really into Stephen King novels as well. I'm not sure what the through-line is there. Dark themes?

I was pretty different from other boys, a real loner, so I'm not sure I could give you a great answer that resonates broadly. I do remember reading The Perks of Being A Wallflower and relating very very heavily to it. Other loner kids like me loved Catcher in the Rye. I don't really care for her anymore, but I got really really into Ayn Rand novels my sophomore year, and reading The Fountainhead actually kind of lead to my career in architecture. She has a very masculine and hero-centric way of writing main characters, for better or worse.

"lwvx9zz","MasturRoshi","2024-11-13 07:56:28 UTC","I currently work for a bookstore and lead/curate titles for the speculative fiction section. From my experience I can confirm that there are not many straight white male narrator books coming out, especially in young adult. I promise you it’s not that female focused perspectives are being unfairly recognized compared to male ones.  

Publishers and bookstores are very much cashing in on the explosion of romance/romantasy and in turn are heavily targeting that demographic as much as possible.  A consequence of that is the demographic of young adult males is more or less cast aside. In recent memory the one notable YA book published that I could reasonably argue is targeted for males is Murtagh by Paolini. Nearly everything else is female focused and driven, and in terms of just general YA fiction it’s even more true. 

This is less so the case in adult fantasy and especially science fiction. There are definitely male centric books/series being published and marketed, notable authors would be Sanderson, Joe Abercrombie, John Gwynne, Jay Kristoff, James Islington, Pierce Brown, Scalzi, Vandemeer, S.A Corey etc. That being said, looking at it from a numbers/volume perspective those series and authors (Sanderson being an exception) are generally peanuts compared to the volume of ACOTAR, Throne of Glass, Fourth Wing, One Dark Window and the countless other viral romance focused or fairytale reimagined series. 

The original comment you responded to is correct that it’s a multifaceted problem, and from a bookseller perspective there are very few younger guys who come into the store and browse the young adult section. They mainly are buying and reading manga as well as some adult speculative fiction (Red Rising is notable, as they already pointed out).","lwvk1zs"

These would be books in the YA category that have American based authors during the current release year. Of the current nominees, male narrators are dual pov males, one white one racially diverse, but both gay. One white male with female two POV. Black male. One white Romanian but I can’t remember if it has dual POV off the top of my head, if it’s not that’s the one only white male POV we have on a list of 15. There’s a couple of others I’d have to look to see if they actually have the male dual POV with the female or just a male character interacting but I think they’re coded as white, but that’s it. It’s not us making a statement either. These get voted into the finals by kids and librarians and teachers. There just weren’t a lot of them.

The book publishers aren’t bothering to cater to them anymore. Also I feel like without counting the authors are starting to skew more female for YA. There are great Black male YA authors too. That’s a whole separate thing though where often women get dropped down and classified as YA because they’re women authors. Especially in fantasy. 

Oh I forgot. Jeff Zentner does white male POVs for YA. He’s a good one. They’re straight. He was a nominee last year. The books are kind of heavy and deep though, not exciting, so they’re not boy favorites unfortunately even though I try to move them.  And the Winter Soldier book by Mackenzi Lee is Bucky Barnes, not a nominee yet, but it’s up and coming, but surprisingly a girl favorite more than a boy favorite. Not so surprising I guess, if you’re picturing Sebastian Stan the whole time.","lwvk1zs"

That kid even read A Court of Thorns and Roses because his girlfriend and I both were gushing about it. He loved it which I found so funny because typically that’s not something my boys would never be caught dead looking at and he admitted that and immediately read Stephen King’s Fairytale to balance the scales. He was like, so much romance, not my thing, but the world there wow. He just doesn’t see it being not cool. He likes to get into series and read harder books.

"lx7nh00","lustywench99","2024-11-15 04:35:49 UTC","Camp Valor definitely! Also depending on which Gratz is his favorite, go in that direction. There’s an amazing autobiography called All the Gallant Men by Donald Stratton about the attack on Pearl Harbor. It’s written so well a lot of the kids didn’t e believe me it was a real story and we had a whole Google session just to see him talk about his book. Soldier Boy by Keely Hutton is about the boys being recruited into war in Africa. A lot of boys who like the war vibes found that one to be really impactful. Cracker is older but also a favorite. It’s about a dog and Vietnam. 

If war isn’t it, Alabama Moon is always a favorite. Wilderness survival (think Hatchet) is really popular with the boys. I Am Still Alive by Alice Marshall is a girl narrator but it almost exclusively is checked out by the boys because she’s surviving in Alaska and for whatever reason it does it for them. 

I try to push a lot of the YA mysteries. One of Us is Lying is my top book checked out three years in a row. Karen M McManus has a lot similar to that as well. Multiple POVs. Always has some boy narrators and seem to be so universally appealing. 

Adventure/Thriller/horror: The Getaway by Lamar Giles is a current nominee for the award I work on. The Unfortunates by Kim Liggett is very popular as well with the boys. It’s got survival vibes too with a dark twist. 

And if he has any interest in sports, Golden Arm by Carl Deuker was one of my favorites and I haaaaate when I get stuck reading the sports books because they just feel like a long description of a play by play and this was so good it made me go try more by him. He’s a good one! Also Rez Ball was really good. 

If you can find a genre he likes, there are great boy books out there. I do have Alan Gratz in my library and I get to meet him in the spring so I’m super excited. But I’ve found my boys in the same situation as your son usually if we go to where the book is, I can go through that genre with them and those are a lot of the titles they pick and enjoy. I wish those genres would have MORE books, but again…. The books have to sell. Gratz sells so well. We have to get authors to find that magic formula. Even my 8th grade daughter has read Alan Gratz. We need like five more authors to do the action adventure historical fiction that’s universally appealing!!","lx0q5ua"

In order to maintain their standing in the social structure that patriarchy imposes on people, men need to perform their gender in a particular way. Simply ""being male"" isn't enough. Boys are taught that it's shameful to enjoy anything that is even slightly female-coded. If they do, they are betraying their gender, and they get labeled as gay, a sissy, a soy boy, a cuck, etc.

Feminism has done an excellent job in the past several decades of dismantling one half of patriarchy by working to free women from their oppressive stereotypes, but the oppressive stereotypes for men remain more or less intact. Case in point: Girls can wear jeans and no one bats an eye. But a boy in a skirt? Unthinkable.

tl;dr: we need more feminism","lx5rdrp"

"lwv1atn","underhelmed","2024-11-13 03:26:34 UTC","I have seen it said that girls tend to envision themselves in main character while boys tend to assume the role of the main character. Girls think about what they would do in that situation while boys think about what the character would do in that situation. Some also link this to the degree of passion (tantrum?) that men tend to display when things are changed about their favorite media, while women don’t tend to see those changes as a big deal.

I’m curious if any of that rings true or contrary to you given your experience and viewpoint?

I’m not sure I believe that media consumed leads to differences in empathy between males and females, I think the drivers are probably deeper than that. Beyond socialization, since boys and girls tend to separate themselves into single-sex groups at a certain age without prompting and have different play styles.

People do read about characters that aren’t like them all the time, I think the differences in perspectives and thinking between individuals are far more important (possibly to developing empathy, if indeed there is a link) than the differences between racial, ethnic, or people groups. I’m not like Frodo or Humbert Humbert or Elizabeth Bennet or Ged or Katniss Everdeen. 

But as I type this, I realize that part of the difficulty is that the genres I am most interested in reading rarely have non-white protagonists. In fact, I was excited to have stumbled across the Seedbearing Prince series (by DaVaun Sanders, very good fantasy novel with sci fi trappings) with an obviously and unapologetically black protagonist. 

Sorry to ramble, thanks for causing me to think about this further, I’ll try to read more books from people that don’t look like me, as well as those that don’t think like me.

They are the books its safe to give your 12 yo who has read every other popular series though.

The real problem happens when you have a 12-year-old who has read the dunes and the Lord of the rings and, now there’s nothing left to read that’s at the reading level you’ve advanced too that is semi appropriate.

You can pretty much pick up a book and get into it after a long, stressful day. 

While there are exceptions, a lot of the books targeted at younger men (James Rollins' Sigma Force, Jack Reacher and some of Chris Ryan's books) tend to be heavier. They aren't books that you can pick up and read between classes, or after having your brain fried from a stressful day.

I could also talk about the problems in female-written and targeted manga, but women/girls are still reading novels alongside manga, boys aren't, so it's irrelevant. The entire purpose of the article is about male-driven media.

The idea that men prefer visual media is shaky at best and hasn't been definitively proven, plus, the article mentions that boys **can** be pulled into reading novels, it just isn't happening. Comics and television and video games have been around for years, but only recently has male literacy become a huge issue and while manga might be a factor it can't be the only one. YA books are not the only ones that boys can read, I read plenty of fantasy and crime books for adults as a teen, as did most of my peers. The issue is that they aren't reading much of anything. In fact, young people are increasingly not reading for pleasure, and yet this is framed as an issue of 'how can we save the boys specifically' when we can easily focus efforts on getting all young people reading more.

\\> You guys realize some huge shonen manga, like FMA, which was big for men were also written by women. Lots of female creators in the male targeted manga space. More diversity there than in Shojo or Josei manga.

However, “failed” implies that the onus lies entirely on publishers. Not the stripped funding from libraries, not parents who discourage reading about XYZ topic, XYZ location, who tell boys that their interests are ‘for girls’, or boys who were told they were ‘dumb’ for reading books below their grade level. That was what heavily discouraged my peers from reading while I was growing up, but I grew up in two rural, conservative, very Christian communities. My experience isn’t all, so if you have anything for me to read on the matter, though, I’m all eyes and ears. 

I grew up with parents who taught me that I could be self sufficient as long as I knew how to find information for myself, and once I fully grasped that, my interests didn’t matter anymore. Reading wasn’t ‘fun’, reading was liberating, and that fostered my love of books far more than any ‘fun’ book I had ever read. 

Is it possible that parents of young girls are more likely to teach the importance of self-education and self-empowerment. I feel, and have always felt, as though schools and parents alike don’t take appropriate initiative to foster this in children regardless of gender.

For example, Japan also produces a lot of female-oriented manga (shōjo) if quite high readership amongst teenaged Japanese girls, but those have a much harder time reaching the west because there’s not a big hole in the market for them to penetrate.

As for the portrayal of young men in Japanese shōnen, I admit I don’t know much of what goes on, specially since It’s been a long long time since I read any manga, the last few are quite old and either written by women (D.Gray-Man and Fullmetal Alchemist) or hard to even describe (Hunter x Hunter).

"lwx7o91","PersonofControversy","2024-11-13 14:39:41 UTC","I suspect that this whole ""self-insert"" thing could be an important factor in the whole ""why don't boys read books about girls"" issue.

I can think of very few stories about boys/men in which the gender of the main character is actually important. Instead man/boy is just treated like the default, and is unremarked upon. More often than not you can swap the gender of the main character, and all that's really changed is that the story now takes place in a world in which misogyny isn't really a thing (which would probably be a bonus for a lot of people just looking for escapism).

The same thing goes for race. Very few main characters I know of actually have to be white. Swap the race of the main character, and more often than not all that's changed is that the story now takes place in a world where racism isn't really a thing.

The most archetypal example of this I can think of is Harry Potter, a book about a boy with tons and tons of female fans. Misogyny and skin colour based racism already aren't really a thing in the Wizarding World. Swap ""Harry"" for ""Harriett"" and the story stays fundamentally the same. 

But if we take romance novels, the most stereotypical genre of ""girly books which men won't read"", this idea breaks down. Dating/romance is one of the most explicitly gendered experiences there are, especially when its stereotypical. Swap the gender the typical romance novel protagonist, and the entire story breaks down. Or rather, if a boy tried to self-insert into the protagonist of the stereotypical romance novel, every second page would pull them out. 

It would be like you trying to self-insert into a protagonist whose ""lily-white skin"" gets mentioned every third paragraph. 

The same goes for basically any female-led story which touches upon gender issues. Yes, it would absolutely be a good thing for boys to read more of these sorts of stories. But if we're talking about ""ease of self-insert"", then adding anything about misogyny to a book automatically make things a lot harder for male readers, because it creates a main character which must be female. 

Hell, this is probably why the female-led stories I can think of that are popular with men (Alien, The Hunger Games, etc...) also tend to be the ones in which gender is most irrelevant. Make Ripley a man instead of a woman and nothing about Alien changes. Gender swap the entire cast of The Hunger Games and, again, nothing really changes, etc... I'd even say that the first Wonder Woman movie counts. It had the least amount of gender-discourse you could have in a movie about the princess of the Amazons, and also had pretty universal appeal. 

Basically I think what I'm trying to say here is that boys are actually pretty good at reading/watching ""stories about a woman"", but (unfortunately) shy away from ""stories about *being a women*"". 

And that the reason we don't see the opposite trend among girls is because ""stories about *being a man*"" are actually pretty rare, or tend to be indistinguishable from ""stories about being a woman in a world where misogyny doesn't exist"", in the same way ""stories about being white"" are indistinguishable from ""stories about being a POC in a world where racism doesn't exist"". 

Honestly the only stories I can think of in which the MC has to be a man are stories about misogynists - but I imagine girls don't like reading those for the more obvious reason.","lwuvewz"

And obviously this also depends with video games, your son might be playing online competitive games instead which have a social aspect instead of being the story interest, so it all depends too. 

And then there is the stigma that comes with books too, because they are usually an assignment by schools so they are associated to work and not leisure by kids most of the time.

I've always loved books, but I never really read the vast majority of the literature assigned by teachers except like the Odyssey. The fact it was an assignment made it more boring than they otherwise probably looked, the fact they were not my preferred genre of literature even more so. Note, i always had amazing grades in all languages i've studied, and reading is a big part of that learning experience, I just didn't like that I was being told what to read, even if it was an outstanding piece of literature. 

You can definitely study a piece of literature sufficiently well without reading it in full, but you cannot keep a person engaged and attentive through a process they do not enjoy.


I think a lot of the ways some schools handle how to get kids to read drives people away of even trying to pick up a book.

Paranormal romance novels are only marked as fantasy. And often there's some simplistic fantasy style plot. But it's mainly about the studly wizard/werewolf/vampire/whatever who all have the hots for the protagonist.

And of course it's a spectrum. I stuck with the Mercy Thompson series for quite some time since it was mostly urban fantasy - with the romance secondary. Not too much more than the classic hardboiled detective novel where all the dames are into the MC - just not aimed at me and my fantasies. (Big hunky protective werewolf men are not something I fantasize about.)

I don't read to get into my own headspace, I read to get into someone else's. God I can't imagine how boring it would be to go about my life and only read books that were focused on that same life.

The issue is that selling women-led media to men isn’t smooth going, so they’ve got to walk a careful line.

Men still spend a good amount on video games so this is where we’re seeing more pushback/less women-led media, but women are starting to flood this market more & more which is a problem for parts of the community.

Basically, what I'm noticing and thinking is that society still (unfortunately) puts pressure on children to develop amd grow in certain ways, instead of letting them do so naturally, and gravitate towards their own interests and so on. 

I was having a talk with a few friends vaguely related to this, not education in itself but more about playing and toy preferences - started from my 4 year old niece getting a toy nail painting kit and how excited she was - and it lead to a talk about the toys girls and boys gravitate towards and if it's somehow innate or just that there's a certain push from society towards girls' vs boys' toys. I'm not an educator or parent myself, so my experience is fairly limited to my niece, a few friends here and there who have kids and just what I read online or hear about so I'm not an expert. But my personal opinion is that, just like with education, there is still a certain old fashioned idea about boys being boys and girls being girls, and that they each have their own pre-defined paths, for lack of a better term.

I'm guessing the reference to parental behavioural expectations is a reference to the social/play developments where girls are expected to contribute to household tasks more frequently in some families. In this case it might be the result of something that is quite opposite to it in that primary caregivers communicate a lot less frequently and with a smaller vocabulary and range of topics to infant and child boys. This results  again in slower language acquisition and may be the cause of the differences seen in brain development. It's always one of those nature/nurture things where you can see the end result but you can't tell how much of which aspect is affecting the other.

I think ultimately, and especially your comment about The Perks of Being a Wallflower, is that we want to be SEEN in the fiction we read. In the characters and their struggles. Which makes sense why representation matters so much. But at the same token, I hope that when my son grows up, he can see himself in the fiction that is present, too; or rather, he finds art he can relate to in some shapexor manner.

My dad and my husband were/are both voracious male readers. My dad lived in a country with loads of classics being translated to his language. He loved Jack London's books like White Fang, which dealt with wilderness, survival, and nature. Or Count of Monte Cristo, or Robison Crusoe. Swashbuckling male heroes and adventures.

My husband loves SciFi and fantasy novels.

Frankenstein is a good example. Knowing the background and significance of the book is educational.

They should teach it, but there are quality books that have similar themes and are more relatable to kids. 

And as the OP comment said since some parents are part of the problem when it comes to picking out stories, it will have to be up to the school to introduce them to a variety of different types of genres.


They should also talk about movies. If you tell some kids that one of their favorite movies is based on a book they're going to want to read the book.  It's not the most modern example, but if you told somebody that Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report were all based on books written by Philip K.

But if you advised a kid to read one of King's shorter books or something humorous like ""The hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" they will finish it. Neither of those could be considered high art, but they are fun and sometimes people need fun. 

Funnily enough, when I was in school(graduated '06) most of the gamers and kids that played non-traditional sports were also big into reading. 

On a side note there are a lot of books targeted to teenage girls that are quite mature. I don't think some of them are technically YA, but they are definitely written for teenagers to read. 

I skimmed through the wiki of ""The Hate U Give."" Depending on how well it's written, something like that could be a substitute for ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""

"lwuzi31","alanna_the_lioness","2024-11-13 03:15:03 UTC","Oh, no perceptions of an argument, even without the caveat! (But my own caveat here: I read/wrote YA heavily and signed with an agent for a YA thriller so I do like to think I know the market.)

YA is increasingly trending older to appeal to adult readers. It's a level of escapism, I think. There's an optimism in YA that tends to be lacking in adult lit; teens still have hope for the future while a lot of adult books deal with the burdens of, well, being adults. Older teens can dabble in the same kinds of topics like sex, substance use, etc, that appeal to adults without killing that sense of a bright spot on the horizon. Or, at least, this has always been part of it for me, and I know rings true for some of my friends who write in the YA space. 

Publishers have seen the profitable potential in appealing to adult readers as this is a demo more likely to spend money on books. As such, YA is skewing older than it used to, which is isolating younger teen readers who have moved past MG but aren't ready for the more mature YA scene. Those beloved YA books of decades past, like Princess Diaries or the Georgia Nicolson books, really have no place in the current market, or at least by debut authors. YA protagonists are most commonly 16-18, while MG taps out around 12-13, leaving a hole in the market for readers in the middle. Despite librarians crying out for more books in this space for years, publishers don't seem to give a shit because aiming for older teens/wistful adults is where the money is.

Honestly, this comes full circle on how publishers focused on the more ""traditional"" YA space don't seem to care about targeting male teen readers. They know their market and they're going to focus on what brings in the most cash and, as a risk-averse industry, the landscape is unlikely to change unless something breaks through and demonstrates otherwise. 

Edit: I'm not trying to say that adult books are inherently depressing because there are plenty of light, fun adult books out there (romance, romantasy, cozy fantasy, cozy mystery... all genres that trend lighter) but YA tends to come with a certain tone and voice that speaks to youth. And there are plenty of amazing YA books that speak to complex topics, but they're always going to be framed in a different lens.","lwuxd2w"
"lwvck0l","alanna_the_lioness","2024-11-13 04:45:07 UTC","Interestingly, I don't think you can actually argue those as books targeted at ""younger men."" In terms of demographics, you need to look at the imprint publishing the book. The books you listed are I think published by adult imprints, which are not the same imprints that publish true YA. In terms of books for younger male readers specifically (teen readers, to clarify... MG is still a robust market for boys)... there really aren't many unless you pivot into graphic novels or more online alternatives like light novels, LitRPG, and manga. 

And FWIW, I'm not actually talking about romance as a genre. Just pointing out that most modern YA tends to have a romance plot point.

My daughter is in her 30s and is on the favored side, so my family is fine. My wife has three degrees too. Righting a wrong is always an excuse that can be made. But the result of more than 50 years of trying hard to encourage women in education while providing no help for struggling men is not that the wrongs are righted. You just become the one doing the wrong. Education has worked hard to show men that they are not wanted. So in the last 4 years college enrollment of men is down by 9.8% and of women by 5.8%, but women already outnumbered men. In the US women are 58% of college entrants, and also graduate at a higher rate. The lowest lead is in West Virginia where 50.2% of entrants are women. Great. Good for them. Nothing should happen to reduce those numbers.

And now what happens? Ignorant people who can't succeed and who are not attractive to the more educated average woman end up at a loose end and resent where they are. And now we are seeing how badly they can behave.

This is an issue that affects a lot of boys and young men, and it’s an issue that stems from our patriarchal society. They are victims of the society that we have built, and it is our collective responsibility to break down those patriarchal systems.

Like Hollywood as much as it touts being progressive, and as much as conservatives will decry it for being woke, whatever the hell that means, it is still very conservative and dare I say exploitative with a lot of groups. Like the actor who played as Data in The Goonies and Short Round in the temple of doom, said that Hollywood 'finally grew up' (eg: stopped treating Asians buy and large as stereotypical stock characters) with *Crazy Rich Asians*. You're also seeing a lot of largely Independent films like *Moonlight* and *Everything Everywhere All at Once* basically snapping up accolades and being very well received by with what all due respect are traditionally pretty white audiences.


Like honestly, why any author or anybody would work with Hollywood now without a contact that gives them an incredible amount of say and leverage is kind of beyond me. If you're lucky, you might find a studio that's willing to give you a generous amount of creative control and it will put you with a director who knows what they're doing and is willing to follow your work and understand what you wrote, or you might find a studio who really is just looking to use your material as a pre-established IP, and you're going to have a director who wants to make their own movie, but they have to fit your IP in some way, so it's just going to be a completely different movie wearing your characters, your settings, and your narrative as a skin suit. This is something that Rick Riordan encountered with *Percy Jackson and the Olympians*, where he said that basically every single decision that Disney made about what to include and exclude just completely fucking baffled him, because he wrote scenes that were very cinematic in nature, would look really good on camera, in the book, and they just completely tossed that out.","lwvlbvb"

I can't get to my copy right now, but if memory serves he described the story as 'Moby Dick in space', with an asteroid in place of the whale. I think he may have eventually gotten it published, but possibly had to change the lead character to a white man.

I just know because he cited this as the main reason he started writing 'Fahrenheit 451' to begin with, because he was sick of people telling him what he was *supposed* to write, and even brought it up in the book. There's a fantastic sequence around the middle where Captain Beatty explains to Montag that the censorship of their world is self-imposed, because people don't like reading about things they can't relate to or don't understand. IE: white people don't want to read about black people, because how can they relate to them?

It's one of the most relevant parts of the entire book, considering how many people constantly demand better and better representation, which while a valid point itself often boils down to just 'make the main character look exactly like *me*', and pointing out how people will ignore media if they can't find something identifiable in the main character, again: 'I won't read this because the protag is a straight white male'. Doesn't matter if the story is good or the character is complex, interesting and relatable, people would skip past it purely because they don't physically identify with the lead.","lwxmeez"

My parents read to us both, and we were allowed to stay up an extra 30 minutes after bedtime if we were reading in bed. We were both avid readers and we’d often swap books. I don’t recall at what age things started shifting but at some point, card games and video games became more of his thing where I stuck to reading (I find some video games fun but for the most part they just aren’t my thing). Sometimes it just comes down to personality. I do think that instilling good reading habits helps but there’s a number of things that could drive someone away from reading. 

Friend groups (either being teased for reading or friends that are more interested in other things) or a bad school experience (like being forced to read books that are of zero interest) are two that I can think of pretty easily. Even in adulthood I fell out of a reading habit for a bit because I was forcing myself to read non-fiction and getting burnt out on it. When I finally admitted to myself that fantasy is what I enjoy most and it’s ok to enjoy fantasy as an adult I fell deeply back in love with reading.

Anecdotally, I've gone through spells where I read quite a bit for enjoyment and spells where I read quite sparingly. The times when I've had the least interest in reading for pleasure have by and large correlated with the times when I was obligated to read substantially for other reasons—uni, grad school, technical reading for work. I think it was over a year after I finished my master's before I got back into reading as a leisure activity.

I still observe the same trend now: when I'm working on a research-heavy project at work and spend a lot of time deep in the weeds of industry publications, I'm much more likely to reach for the remote or a video game controller when I get home at the end of the day. Then sure enough as things shift I drift back towards reading, usually something fluffier at first and then more serious works until the cycle repeats.

These characters do not seem like real people, they seem like caricatures meant to pander rather than represent.

In strong contrast would be Ripley in Alien and Sarah Connor in Terminator 2, who managed to be strong and badass while still seeming believably human - and also female, unlike most Michelle Rodriguez characters who are basically just a word-for-word swap with a male action lead.

I just got busy in high school-STEM classes, tech ed, sports, girls, friends and I kept getting assigned various plays and books that I had absolutely no interest in (looking at you Jane eyer and Brontë sisters). The headspace I had for reading was taken up by sparknoting my required readings. When I got to choose a book for a report I actually read and enjoyed them (the jungle and James Bond). 

It’s a tricky position for teachers. I’d have loved to read books I enjoyed if I had to do less work than a full on essay which only pushed me to enjoy reading less. 

Also shorter books tend to be more story driven than details which is helpful for the overwhelming number of young men with ADHD (diagnosed or not). The hatchet or James Bond is easier to pickup (and finish) than jumping into Harry Potter. 

I also found that I didn’t enjoy literature written by women in general (based on what I was assigned) due to what consistently I found to be excessive details that made it hard to follow what was important.

Fwiw, some video games have more reading in them than an actual book. We just don’t view it that way. Mass Effect 3 has enough text for *seven full books* within it. Most of that is lore too, so it’s not just conversation, but quite literally book material. 

Madden? Cod? Less so, for sure, but I don’t discount gaming as a non-reading activity. A lot of gamers prefer subtitles, which means we’re reading all the time. Because of how frequent gamers tend to game, this means they read pretty frequently. Might be weird to think about, but those boys might’ve been reading more than you.

And there's been a failure in society to bridge that transition as smoothly as we like.

For example, could someone like Kurt Vonnegut or Chuck Palahniuk get away with some of the stuff they wrote in the past today, without significant industry backlash? Yet the stuff they wrote resonated with a lot of men of their time.

Hell, look at how much backlash Haruki Murakami gets on this sub on a monthly basis. I'd consider him a writer who writes from an unapologetically straight male POV, and doesn't really deviate much from it. AFAIK, he hasn't attempted to change his style or to pander to other demos he may be missing out on. He also strikes me as not being as plugged in to online trends as younger male authors might be, so he probably keeps doing what he's doing because he doesn't worry about what people say about him today. In 2024, he might be one of the remaining popular male authors of the past 30 years who hasn't ""updated"" his style. Many other straight male authors who succeeded in the past writing from a distinctly ""straight male"" style have altered their styles with varying degrees of success.

I briefly went through the first 200 listed and found one, The Mongol Ascension, where its straight young adult male focused.

I'm not saying the points you are trying to make are not valid, albeit somewhat emotionally charged. I understand the struggles that marginalized groups face when looking for representation, however in this case the data is implying straight young adult/teenage males are the marginalized group within this specific category (I know how that might sound somewhat ridiculous).

Generally speaking there is a definite gap in accessible series between middle grade and adult fiction/speculative fiction for men. Which I think is interesting because if you look at a format like manga, the biggest genre is shounen which is targeting that exact audience and is doing incredibly well in terms of volume and interest. I know the audience who read shounen manga are not exclusively young adult men but I would argue it says that there is an audience interested in reading more accessible speculative fiction stories.

One thing to note is that the article is describing it as an issue where young adult men have trouble finding newly published books to browse or new series to look forward to.

Or is it something more innate that facilitates different types of socialization so that’s what we’ve fallen into as a species?

Maybe I’m not understanding the general tone correctly but I tend to reflexively interpret mentions of girls being socialized to (insert given prosocial behavior) as complaints about how them acting in that manner is bad for them in some nebulous way? Or that it’s simply unfair that boys aren’t socialized to be that way so girls shouldn’t have to be either. 

On books, I guess it’s hard enough to get many boys to read in general, that expecting they will read outside of their primary interests would be sort of a pipe dream.

There’s some interesting stuff about how girls can cross lines in sex/gender-segregated play without the consequences that boys suffer from other boys and girls alike. I understand we can say that’s just socialization, but it’s just so widespread that I find it hard to believe there’s not a biological component to it.

What boys are frequently missing in YA literature is the mirror. When they don't see themselves reflected, it can make them feel isolated, alone, and unsure of their place in the world...it is really easy as an adult to look at the state of YA literature (or pop culture in general) and say that the high numbers of female characters is a correction from centuries of erasure.

When I was younger, my mother was the primary driver behind my reading habits. She'd put a book in front of me and tell me to read it as she thinks I'm going to like it and I basically did as she asked.

However once I got more into my teenage years, essentially being told what to do by a parent becomes obviously less appealing so that kinda stopped. As a result it was now my own problem to find books that I think I'll like and from my experience books are terrible at that. 

First of all, there are too many of them. Picking the most appealing option out of an, functionally infinite, number of books is impossible, so it falls on individual books to convince me to settle for them and they are terrible at that. You essentially have the title, cover, and blurb. The blurb is, from my experience, only useful to weed out books with undesirable traits such as romance, and the cover and title are good for catching my attention but not to convince me to actually read the book.

As a result books need to be promoted ""externally"". One option is to catch my attention through an adaptation to a different medium. I read the Witcher books, for example, because I enjoyed the Witcher video games. Unfortunately, this is a bit of a chicken egg problem as adaptations are only made for already popular books.

The other opinion is hearing someone you trust raving about how great a specific book is, and I feel like this was really missing for my life until I started using Reddit and found subs like /r/Fantasy.","lwuxxb7"

This also depends **entirely** on what country and region you're in.

I don't believe that kids are failing society. I believe that young boys and men are not participating in society because they are no longer the sole priority, and rather than encouraging this kind of thing by saying that we should make more books about boys so boys will read them, we should be asking ourselves why boys won't read books about girls, when the reverse is not true. 

I believe that young boys are falling behind and failing to keep up with their peers for various reasons. Do I think this is their 'fault'? No. But I think we need to get a grip and get to the heart of the issue. Women/girls have been reading since long before there was an abudance of female MC's, and the solution is not to just encourage young boys to stay in their bubbles and only read boy-led books.","lwvfa4k"

I appreciate your perspective, but I think my core point might have been overlooked. While excitement and engagement are important, I believe the conversation shouldn’t solely focus on publishers or even school systems. The cultural and social factors that shape what boys are taught to value from a young age are equally, if not more, responsible for the gap we’re seeing in teen boys’ reading habits. Your example of reading being seen as a feminine past-time is just another instance of this. 

This isn’t something the publishing industry can address on its own. It’s a larger issue that ties into how we, as a culture, communicate the importance of learning, creativity, and self-empowerment to young men, just as we already do for young women. Yes, we need books that appeal to their interests, but there also needs to be a shift in how we teach boys about the value of reading—showing them that it’s not just about fun or entertainment but about gaining independence and self-sufficiency. That’s the root issue, in my view.","lwwkfhl"

It's like editors/publishers decided that teen boys were fine just skipping to adult fiction without any middle ground, and it doesn't surprise me at all that once passionate readers abandon it between middle & high school.

The flip side of this is that elementary kids are like sponges and will read until their eyes fall out, and that tween/teen girls have a huge and growing corpus of literature to pick from.

Because oftentimes, they actually *don’t* (or at least they never used to; more on this later), and it’s a very tiny minority that get displayed in the media, which then causes generalisations that all white people hate media featuring POC. After all, what’s going to sell newspapers and other media: the news that white people are happy to consume POC media and nobody really cares, or that there’s a growing division amongst different racial groups? It’s this division that the media has been stoking for years that causes this perception that white people hate anything POC, or at least, that’s how it’s going in America.

Back in my teens in the late 90s and early 00s, some of my favourite characters in media were Neo from the Matrix, Blade, Ged from Earthsea, Ripley from Alien, Samwise Gamgee and Jackie Chan in generally everything he did. Blade and Neo especially were seen as incredibly cool by me and my friends, and nobody gave a shit about their skin colour. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was also highly appreciated amongst my friend group. We were all white kids in England, and we just basically didn’t see colour or sex, we just basically went on “is this cool or not?” - which is why we ended up trying to recreate a lot of Jackie Chan or CTHD fight scenes on the playground at school, or used to swear like Blade. Because that was what we deemed was cool, and nobody cared.

Nowadays though, the American media seems to be pushing division spectacularly, which is why there’s now a massive perception that all white people hate anything POC. I personally don’t think that’s true at all.","lwvbvmc"

And I know some of the things you mentioned were TV shows, but I didn't have the energy to also look into that for the sake of a reddit comment. But there have been TV series focusing on men, like Loki, Daredevil, and Moon Knight


Anyways, looking at the trend for movies, it seems that over the last decade they've been overwhelmingly male-focused, started including a few women here and there around 2019, and in the last two to three years have been getting more 50/50

Maybe things have changed in the last 10-15 years but as someone who was a kid before the last 10-15 years, this was very much not the case. 

But it’s also not the point. The pojnt is that when there were many fewer stories centering girls in popular culture, girls still engaged with the stories that were available to them. They didn’t just decide not to read because it was considered normal for everyone to engage with stories about boys

I think the stories available should reflect a wide variety of experiences and we should be going for 50/50 when it comes to gender, but in addition to that, it should be normalized for all children to read stories from a variety of perspectives and not only read stories with main characters that are just like them.","lwuzovk"

And the difference can be observed regardless of the genetic sex of the population groups (XX, XY, XXY, XXX, etc.)

Of course, the research shows that it's all a bunch of overlapping distributions. So many men are more empathetic than many women. And there is also a body of research showing that empathy can be taught and is far from being determined by biological factors alone. But at the same time, there is still a detectable, statistically significant difference in tendencies based on in utero testosterone levels.

A trilogy of normal sized books, a novella, short stories, and art, all in one book.  But frankly he has a very snappy style.  Page turner fantasy.  He writes the stuff Magic the Gathering cards alude to.  Sort of.  I cannot imagine an engaged kid of 12 or up having a problem.  And  only sometimes is the violence graphic, never language or sex.  Think heavy pg-13 maybe?

Honestly for a start, either Elantris, his first book.  It's not as fight heavy as others, but I really enjoyed it, and it got him the job finishing the Wheel of Rime after the author if that series passed.  Or Mistborn.  That's where his skill at action first showed through, and while Elantris has some twists, it's Mistborn that really got him that rep.  There's always another secret.  He's great at telling you a backstory, then revealing everything about it was a lie.  It also got him known for the Sanderlanche.  Where the last third of his books tend to be one giant escalating rolling avalanche of action and revelation.  I've stopped his books late at night, knowing that moment is hitting.  I've got a job!  I need to sleep!

Here's the first secret:  Most of his books connect in something called the Cosmere.  We're only getting a firm idea on what it all means now.  So if you like one, ask around just a bit so you can explore it all fully.  Each series is stand alone, but something bigger is happening.","lwv1n02"

But it's honestly some amazing work of fantasy fiction. The latter books in the series so far begin exploring the cosmere a bit more, as does the 2nd era of the Mistborn books.

They are, in essence, saying it’s reasonable for marginalized groups to be drawn to media that depicts themselves, but unreasonable–or worse, malicious–for not-as-marginalized groups to be drawn to media that features themselves.

But does that really invalidate their claims? I guess they could be leaving it as implied that those marginalized groups are already consuming media featuring main characters that are not like them, so they should be able to do as the majority does and see themselves represented also. 

When a white or male character is replaced with a POC or female character, it does sometimes feel like they are saying there is something wrong with being white/male and they are fixing it. But, should we instead see it as, we expected POC/women to watch/read white male characters, and have plenty of media where that is the case, that it shouldn’t be a big deal to watch/read a POC/female character. But, to your point, if it’s no big deal, then why is it so important to change characters? Why not leave them alone and make new POC/female characters? 

Sort of seems like a Catch-22.

Idk, I just think women and people of color deserve to see cool movies with lead actors that look like them and aren’t stereotypes.

You say programs and initiatives and drives for girls are to combat bias - but women have been a majority of college grads for 40 years. They were a majority in the first gulf war, before the end of the Irish troubles etc - in modern history they are the majority and yet are still prioritised while boys get further behind. That’s wrong.

Feminist ideals have caused many women posting here to project the image of long dead men onto little boys, as though they had lived past lives of their great grandfathers, and equally onto themselves as though they were women from a time they weren’t even alive in. And it’s absurd.

Listen to yourself - “it’s alright for girls to have programs helping them more than boys when they’ve been a majority for 40 years” - “boys already have old books and girls were held back in the past, boys don’t need new books”. Do you hear how biased you sound?

When hearing things like that why would you even expect boys who might welcome gender equality to support it? All attitudes like yours are teaching them is men were right to act like they did in the past as this is the what happens when they don’t. 

It’s not the teen boys who will make equality fail - it’s those with your attitudes.

And what’s more teen girls overwhelmingly read books with female protagonists, if they didn’t then this wouldn’t even be a topic of discussion as there should be loads of male leads for boys to read about (since according to you that’s what teen girls read). So your two positions (girls reading about boy main characters, but boys not reading about girls - so that’s why they don’t read now) on this contradict one another.
There have literally always been female MC’s which were more popular with women long before anyone cared about gender equality. Austen, the Brontes - that whole style of literature is about women main characters, and clearly caters to women’s fantasy.","lwviu8j"

Parents themselves are doing a shit job of raising their kids. Girls in most cultures expected at an earlier age are assigned chores and help around the house while boys the same age are allowed to play and be noisy.  Girls are sent to school with expectation they will work while boys aren't prepared or trained to focus on starting a task or finishing a task or for sitting quietly that long.

Think about the bridge you describe Potter as and transport it back to a climate without YA as we know it today. In the 90s rather then the expansive sections we have today 4th grade me was confronted with a problem of getting less fulfilled with Animorphs and other book fair faire and not really knowing where to go next.

I ended up sometime around 5th grade leaping over to sci-fi and fantasy reading names like Asimov, Herbert, and Tolkien seasoned liberally with the classic EU books of Star Wars. The only time I saw them given a grade level was a few years in when someone snuck the Foundation series onto the summer reading list... for upcoming 12th graders. 

Were I but a few years younger I'd have been right at the forefront of Pottermania. Instead I never read them having 'aged out' and just observed their impact.

This difference in presentation is why girls are wildly under diagnosed for adhd. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to think those differences may play into other trends that we see with teenagers.

I only mentioned that as shorter, more active plot books (often action/adventure) are a lot easier to read through than staring at a massive novel. Like look at any James Bond book that you don’t have to necessarily read in series order vs most popular YA series, the sheer volume of what you “have to read” to catch up in a series can be overwhelming. A single slim book that is easier to keep with me is a lot easier to start and finish.

"lwxp5po","E-is-for-Egg","2024-11-13 16:14:14 UTC","So your comment prompted me to look at it further, and I found this from the introduction to a study


> According to the gender paradox in suicidology, an important sex difference has been reported for suicidal behavior. Females have higher rates of suicide ideation and suicide attempts than males, while fatal suicide acts are typically higher for males than for females [8,9,10,11,12]. The lethality of suicidal behavior in females is lower, most likely because males choose more violent suicide methods [8,13,14]. However, the reason why males and females choose different suicide methods is still controversial. One hypothesis is that men tend to gravitate toward more lethal methods than females because they have higher suicide intent [15,16,17,18]. Canetto et al. [8] proposed that women and men use different suicide methods as a result of the sex roles in their culture.


> From an epidemiology point of view, suicide rates in women and men often depend on other features including age and ethnicity [19,20]. Furthermore, suicide rates vary significantly between countries and over time, and studies on gender differences across countries are still controversial [21,22,23,24,25]. Interestingly, women more frequently present traditional risk factors for suicide than men, including depression [26], childhood sexual abuse [27], and prior suicidal ideation and attempts [28].


> Hitherto, only a few studies have investigated the clinical profiles of men and women who attempt suicide [29,30,31,32]. Monnin et al. [29] in a study on 273 participants selected in psychiatric emergency units after a suicide attempt, observed that women presented a higher rate of anxiety disorders and men presented more alcohol dependence and drug dependence and abuse. Furthermore, the authors described gender differences in the suicidal act; women presented more impulsivity and men had a higher suicidal intent [29]. However, a comprehensive review on the role of sex in self-injurious thoughts and behaviors showed that studies on the differences in suicide intent across suicide attempts in males and females is mixed, with some studies showing that males report higher suicide intent, and others not showing a significant difference [31]. Sex differences and a change in the lethality of suicidal behaviors were reported by Isometza and Lonnqvist [33]. Death by suicide is influenced by the chances of rescue during the suicide attempt [34,35,36] and depend on factors such as the availability of the method preferred and chosen for suicide, knowledge of lethal effects of the method (e.g., how many pills to take), familiarity with using a particular method (e.g., familiarity with firearms), and the concomitant use of alcohol, drugs and medications [37,38]. In their study, Berardelli et al. [39] assessed suicide method lethality in 107 psychiatric inpatients who attempted suicide and found that patients who used a highly lethal method presented specific demographical and clinical characteristics, but they found no differences by gender [39]. Other studies showed that men are more likely to use relatively more lethal methods than women [8,10]. Particularly, firearms and jumping in front of moving objects were observed frequently in males, and self-poisoning in females



https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9602518/


So yeah, it seems that attributing it all to guns was incorrect and overly simplistic of me. But there does seem to be reason to suspect that the difference is in method. I saw in another study that, apparently, even when using guns, men were more likely to die just because they were more likely to shoot themselves in the head (the study attributed this to women caring more about their attractiveness, I attribute it to women being judged more for their attractiveness, but tomato tomato)


The difference can also depend on how well you understand lethal methods, how likely it is for anyone to be around to rescue you, and addiction


Some studies show that men just want to die more, others don't. I'm not a suicidologist, but I'm personally dubious of the ""cry for help"" narrative. It seems to just be dismissing women's problems, as often happens in the medical field

The overwhelming majority of young readers want to read about young people, because that's what they understand. And I totally get it! 



I also respectfully disagree what teens who read books written for and featuring teens somehow are weaker readers. I think engaging with books that are compelling and interesting and laying groundwork for recognizing tropes and styles all lend to greater enjoyment, which leads to greater interest, which leads to greater understanding.

Children are absolutely able to see and conceptualise systemic issues beyond themselves, that have been extended through time. They do it all the time when understanding things like poverty and racism. Children are, when given the tools, shockingly astute when it comes to this. 

Girls and women are still being prioritised when it comes to college because without these programs, they would not be looked upon fairly despite their successes. Look at the admissions scandal that happened in Japan. 

I mean this sincerely, if you are seriously making the case that what has happened in the past to women or to men is not relevant then I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the world. Like, the things that our progenitors got up to is relevant to more than just gender issues, for a start. It's madness to say otherwise. 

I don't think teen boys will make equality fail (equality can't 'fail', that's not a thing that it can do), I think that the assumption that if grown men aren't coddled then they are being dismissed and attacked is wrong. The idea that men will just forget any ideas of equality because they are not the sole focus of attention is insulting to male intelligence, frankly. 

Even when there was literature that caterered to women, it was still in the minority. Austen and the Brontes changed the game because they were some of the few that were by women for women. Women made up less than half of authors well into the 70's (at least in the US), and yet women still read books. If men make up around half of all authors, then we should not be seeing a drop off in men reading. I also think a problem with this article is that it's focused on YA, when really boys and men aren't reading as much in any capacity, whereas girls and women are reading much more in general. 

Someone mentioned in a comment that boys not reading might be a chicken and the egg kind of situation, and I can agree with that. I do not believe that there is anything inherently sinister with boy-led stories, I think they should exist. But I think it's totally unhelpful to say that we should just make more boy-led novels and this will fix the literacy problem we have; boys should be encouraged to read more books with girl MC's, and boy-led novels should be considered a separate issue to do with markets, rather than as an answer.","lwvl7up"

What's also concerning is the lack of rigor in a number of other studies found.

Few referenced the gender of the teacher or attempted to assess or control for it as a variable as just one example.

1. Most teachers are women and women teach girls not boys. Women tend to teach the way they themselves would have liked to be taught (samen for men). Because most teachers are women that means they teach how girls learn not boys.

2. The same goes for the department of education (in NL) consists of between 75 and 85% female employees.  They than write curriculums and determine teaching methods that work better for girls.

3. Boys are much much harder to control. Boys have a harder time at a young age to sit down and absorb.   And due to larger and larger classes teachers do not have the time to ""control"" them. 
As a side note this is also where used to parents come in and help, but don't anymore.

4. Young men have a harder time working in female dominated environments (I don't remember if they found a cause for this). Which means that as the percentage of girls increases in higher classes of high-school (in the Netherlands we devide highschool by performance level). Boys start to do worse in a feedback loop.

The only stuff that's really overlapped between the two of them were the Harry Potter series in 2nd-3rd grade and Tolkien in 3rd-4th grade.

My current 2nd grader is reading Erin Hunter's Warriors (cats) series, and one of the things my wife & I have found interesting is just how similar it is to similar dramatic, lightly magical fiction series aimed at YA and at adults.  Many characters, complex plots, lots of dramatic turns, etc, but written at an elementary school level with restraint on how graphically things like violence, death, and intrigue are described.

As in they'll be kissing in one paragraph and then waking up in bed in the next. Sexual violence is implied but never described (as in it's mentioned that some slave masters in the Mistborn series have children with their slaves, or kill the slave if they get pregnant which of course is implying that rape is a thing that happens.)

What was surprising to me was that only 6% of off-screen talent (directors/screenwriters) are Black with that being lower in some subgenres. On-screen talent appears to actually be broadly proportionate to the general population. They do go on to emphasize that Black people are very underrepresented in c-suite executive positions, which [this article](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-07-01/hollywood-diversity-corner-offices-black-executives-black-lives-matter) sheds more light on, given that it's only at the very highest levels that the disparity is there. But n=\\~230 and the average age of a c-suite executive is mid-fifties. 

  
What does seem to be relevant to this discussion is how Black actors are reportedly pushed to do race-focused or adjacent pictures, which receive less funding.

>  
Fueling this issue is the lack of diversity among marketing teams, executives, and other industry decision makers. Black professionals cite white decision makers’ failure to relate to Black content as a key obstacle to financing. As one Black executive explained, “Marketing teams need to be on board to select a film, but if they don’t feel comfortable with the story, it limits the number of buys.” Similarly, the executive added, “when executives feel like they can’t personally relate to your content, they don’t bid.”

Worth taking a look at the first article especially, though it is by a consulting firm, but the excerpts from the interviews are the most interesting parts. I hope we can move toward more race-agnostic films in the future.

Some have shared those stories with the rest of us, which is a blessing, but “excluded” in this context does not really work.  This is a question of audience demand.  

Yeah, no. Minorities were excluded as the protagonists of *all* media, and included either as minstrels, brutes, criminals, or pitiful figures and almost always as racist stereotypes. The stories that we tell as a society matter, and when a person of color or a sexual minority doesn’t see themselves represented **anywhere**, that is a major issue and that issue transcends gender. Even if another book is never published, there is plenty of male and female representation. And even so, “white” is treated as the default setting for media in the western world, and “white male” even more so. POCs and LBQT have plenty of exposure to seeing the world through a white male lens, just as women have plenty of exposure to seeing the world through a male lens.

That’s right. It’s irrelevant to boys and girls what happened in the past and not a valid excuse to prioritise girls now.

If boys are reading less and going to college less (for 40 years) and women are prioritised in those areas, then modern historical systemic bias is against boys. But some can’t comprehend that because it runs counter to the ideal of women being oppressed and therefore needing more prioritisation - an ideal which believing in enables women with little empathy for men to fully lean into their own self interest and disregard of boys while feeling good about it. 

The boys aren’t coddled and aren’t the focus of any attention, something which you justify here. And that will certainly make them turn on equality which you can already see happening.

I mean... yeah?

Publishers have been dismissing Black authors and queer authors for decades on grounds that there isn't a big enough market to make their fiction profitable.

There's an old (kinda racist) parable/joke/motivational story in the world of marketing:

>Two employees from rival shoe companies are sent to Africa to look for new business opportunities. After a few days of research, they send their findings back to their main offices. Employee number one writes: ""Big waste of time. We won't be able to sell anything. Nobody here wears shoes."" Employee number two, meanwhile, sends their report: ""Massive untapped market! Nobody here wears shoes!""

When I look at the behaviour of the publishing industry in the last few decades, I see a lot of ""employee number one"" type behaviour. So yeah, it's totally plausible to me that publishing executives are totally blind to the fact that they could be selling a lot more books to teen boys.","lwzf0hy"

Most parents might behave with some bias between their boys and girls, but think about the parents of young children that you know — do they go out of their way to reinforce gender roles? Probably not. Subtle differences in treatment based on unconscious bias can’t explain the distinct and dramatic difference between boy and girl siblings. It’s definitely a little bit of nurture for sure, but the overwhelming experience of the young boys being more difficult is more likely explained by natural differences in hormones, biology, etc.

It makes all the sense in the world that since most teachers are women struggling with big class sizes, they would be less equipped to manage the rowdier boys and make sure that theyve actually learned anything by the end of the school year.

I think it helps to have male role models in the educational space, especially in communities where they might lack those figures.

> Boys do better in schools with more men at the front of the classroom, especially in subjects like English. But men account for a shrinking share of the teaching profession: just 24%, down from 33% in the 1980s. In elementary schools, only 11% are men.

I find it especially strange that on a thread about ""why aren't boys reading"" you would suggest cutting English classes... how exactly would that get more boys to read? 

I am all for more trade things being offered, and bringing back shop classes etc and robotics. I'm less convinced that those are ""boy interests"" and not ""girl interests,"" I think plenty of boys and girls would benefit from these options. And I don't think that shop classes getting cut was about making education more female focused, I think it's been driven by cost cutting (robotics equipment is expensive), lawsuit culture (schools fear being sued if a kid cuts off a finger in woodshop), and massive emphasis on standardized testing, where every second in school has to serve ""teaching to the test"" because everything about school funding is tied to standardized test performance.

Even if it's not profitable, they could at least use the guaranteed buying power of library systems to run prints of books targeted to YA men.  
At the very least libraries should be able to do that for teen boys and encouraging them to go to the library and school libraries can only be good in the long run too.

I'm really glad my library has a really large selection of manga, video games, and a really great library of things and tools that appeal more to young men to hopefully get them invested in the library and eventually pick up literature books too.

More displays at my library have felt like they're aimed towards teen boys as well, but as has been pointed out extensively in this thread its largely\\* older books because the librarians simply don't have the selection to do a display of new books that teen boys would like.

Young women are and will continue to read, there's so many great structures for them that I'm not sure the institutional structures in libraries need to be largely targeted towards them either when the issue is young men simply not reading.

For one more anecdote in a thread filled with them, my library had a teen book club, but only girls showed up and it turned into a YA Romantasy book club. There is however a pretty well attended manga book club that a lot of boys go to, so it's really clearly not a lost hope to get more boys to read books.

The shift to girls outperforming boys in school and women getting more college degrees then men didn't happen because we started having English classes. Those were definitely a major part of education when boys outperformed girls. And they are also part of a good, well rounded education, too. I don't agree that being able to read and understand books and media or knowing how to read a map and where the counties of the world are don't serve people in the future.

It’s a well-rounded education, yes, but boys tend to be competitive and solution and practical-oriented, rather than focusing on rote learning. The way that English Lang and Lit, for example, are taught tends to cater towards a more abstract approach, rather than something really practical. Same with stuff like geography; I’ve not applied much of the theoretical knowledge I learnt at school to my life in general, but stuff like reading a map, yeah, that’s useful for my life. That’s what I’m aiming at when I’m suggesting practical rather than esoteric/theoretical knowledge.

> I find it especially strange that on a thread about ""why aren't boys reading"" you would suggest cutting English classes... how exactly would that get more boys to read?

I haven’t suggested that. I suggested doing stuff that would engage boys more; as is evident from the rest of this thread, there’s hardly any literature suitable for boys from a certain age until adulthood. There’s quality literature out there that boys can read and enjoy and engage with at all ages, focusing on that would help get them reading more.

> I'm less convinced that those are ""boy interests"" and not ""girl interests,"" I think plenty of boys and girls would benefit from these options.

Except a ton of effort has been made to get girls into STEM and suchlike, at the cost of ignoring boys. Think of how many programs there are for girls to get into STEM, and then compare it to the amount of programs for boys.

Keep in mind, people who are readers find good books, teens from households where reading is not important and who desire to pick up a book are going to go to a library or book store and the teen section is going to be dominated by fantasy romance-lite or female empowerment stories.
