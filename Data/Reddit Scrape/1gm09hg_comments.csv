Now there was a book in high school I had to read (so, not picked by me) The House on Mango St. That I hated with a burning passion, but I was never bored per se, just did not care for the book (don't even remember why). Honestly I don't even remember anything about the book other than the dislike. Almost kinda tempted to read it again and figure out why 14/15 yr old me hated it.

Then there's Moby Dick. I picked the book, I liked the book. But I also had to take breaks after reading it for a few hours or I just could not focus anymore. It wasn't boring, but I guess it was so dry (ironic for a book that spends not a single second without the presence of dampness, even if only from mists of a seaside town) that I just needed to take it in chunks.

Though considering my interest has been piqued by *In Search of Lost Time* which I am also aware is both over 3000 pages and apparently has a massive 1000+ page lull in the middle, I may find out how I feel about books with boring slogs in them üòÖ.

I finished an 800 page book only because I wanted to see what happened. But I skipped 50-60 pages at a time. I wish I could have looked up a plot summary. Although it did feel kind of freeing and daredevil to skip pages like that XD","lwckd5d"

I think usually if you haven't found something that really grabs you by even a quarter of the book, then its safe to say you won't find something in the final 75%. Or you have a book that a quarter of it is just not your thing, but the 75% is? I'm sure there's books like that lost to the ages.","lw4kww2"
