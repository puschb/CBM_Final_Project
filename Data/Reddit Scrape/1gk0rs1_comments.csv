I think some are better left alone, but we feel Wheel of Time at least was finished by a good choice.

I haven't read many series finished out by a second author but the post asked my opinion- if the publisher or editor has a good knowledge about how other authors write and those authors style, I see no problem as long as they don't veer too far from the original authors vision for the series.

John Betancourt did a decent job of the Amber prequels.

Deborah J. Ross has done a decent job of continuing the Darkover series.

Neither has quite the original author's voice, but they do capture the world within reason.

Then of course you have sequels of Classics, especially Dickens. There are some very good authors like Ronald Frame and Charlton Daines who depict the characters well, but in their own voice, while there are also several that try to work in characters from different stories and fall a bit short.

"lvhtga8","pnzsaurkrautwerfer","2024-11-05 08:51:46 UTC","Depends on the book series.

1. For books that very clearly were mostly done, having someone else at the very least organize the notes enough to ""finish"" the book is acceptable even if it's not wholly functional.  Like James Jones's ""Whistle"" is a rushed ending but it at least wraps up what he started to make an interesting novel about coming home from war.

2. For books that are very formulaic or part of a larger universe, I'm not too put out.  Not in a ""because it's trash"" but a lot of fiction is passed through different writers and production staffs even without the original author being dead (see the old expanded universe star wars).  That one of the authors may be dead is sad, but it's not the same as something that's like ""this man's artistic vision alone drove this""

3. I don't like when the book is barely complete and ""finished from notes.""  Way too often you're past the first chapter or two and it's suddenly obvious this is basically someone else and little of the original author.

4. Series that are very distinct to the author shouldn't be continued, or they shouldn't be continued like Dune has.   

It's going to be subjective obviously but that's just my silly take",""

I love the James Bond novels by Ian Fleming and it's been a mixed bag since he passed away.


Kingsley Amis ""Colonel Sun"" was a really fun Bond novel and the first Bond continuation novel.


Amis wrote a second Bond novel but it was never published, probably because he apparently killed Bond off in it.


The John Gardner novels vary wildly, there's a couple of good one, ""Icebreaker"" is pretty good, but the vast majority are pretty poor.


The Raymond Benson novels are okay, one in particular ""High Time to Kill"", is very good.


From that point the estate tends to get an well-established author to write one or a few books. Sebastian Faulks ""Devil May Care"" is good fun with a fun villain, William Boyds ""Solo"" is okay, Jeffrey Deavers ""Carte Blanche"" is pretty cool, it's a one-off modern reinvention of Bond (War on Terror veteran rather than WW2, doesn't smoke etc.)


Antony Horowitz trilogy though is fantastic, I really think he's a fantastic author and fills Fleming's shoes very well. It's obvious he gets the character and writes him very well. ""Trigger Mortis"" in particular is my favourite and I'd put it up against some of Fleming's best. The other two are fantastic though.",""

So, with a plan, and a solid backup, with no extra books beyond what the original author intended, I'm fine with it.  Anything else should be an ""inspired by"" work, and should instead be treated as an expansion of the original author's universe.

"lvhnj6u","Brad_Brace","2024-11-05 07:45:38 UTC","Don't like it. Dune is the main reason why. To paraphrase Michael from the good place, it's a very human instinct to take a good thing and make it worse so you can have more. But I wish it wasn't. I was honestly depressed after reading The Butlerian Jihad, because it was everything I didn't want it to be. The Butlerian Jihad was the thing I had always wanted to know more about, but it was like I made a wish on a monkey paw, just awful cliched bullshit. They made a god damned Mengelebot!  

I specifically envisioned the Butlerian Jihad as NOT a war against actual machines, that's too easy! I'd like to think Herbert would've made it about a human conflict between those with thinking machines and those without. Those without being the lower classes, rebelling against a society which no longer needs then even as workforce. Then religion co-opting the revolution, as has happened in real life, and the result being the machine havers being defeated, but at the price of a new theocratic age.  

Because in Dune, the subtext is that the Butlerian Jihad is not inarguably a good thing, it created that heavily stratified, immobile and stagnant society. The jihad may have been very handy for Herbert to not worry about technology, but it's also meant to give you pause. Was it actually a good thing if this is the future it created? At the same time, the exaltation of the human potential it brought was a good thing, more or less, there's the whole prescient tyrant threat to worry about, of course. And then Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson gave us Terminator IN SPACE! And fucking Mengelebot. And not an ounce of depth or social commentary.  

I remember also reading a trilogy set in the Foundation series, by three actually quite good writers, but I didn't quite like it either. I think those would've worked well as books on their own, but Asimov's universe requires Asimov's voice.  

And speaking of voice, I don't know if it's true that the last few Discworld books where written by someone else, but I just couldn't finish The Shepherd's Crown, and it wasn't because I was sad. It just doesn't sound like Pratchett, neither does Unseen Academicals, though that one is closer, or Raising Steam, which I did read but is the only one I haven't re-read.  

Unfortunately in the Discworld case, it's probable that the change in voice came from Pratchett's embuggerance and it was him writing those books, which makes me sad and not comfortable criticizing them. I believe after the embuggerance he was only able to dictate those books, and that would explain some things, as them becoming even more dialogue heavy, and feeling more like theater plays in a way.  

All in all, I think I prefer unfinished series and to stop where the author did. The attitude of the knife, to go back to Dune, which Arrakis teaches; Taking an unfinished thing and cutting off the part that's unfinished and saying now it's complete, for it ends here.",""

I think Author’s intent matters. If an author had a long series, with a determined ending, and wanted another author to finish it after they died, then that’s fine.

It often ends up feeling like an echo rather than a true continuation, you know?

Jordan had let the story kinda get off the rails by book twelve and you could tell he was struggling to wrap it up neatly. There were tons of loose story threads you could tell he had forgotten about or didn’t know what to do with. Sanderson, as a big fan of the series himself, took a fine tooth comb to the existing books and Jordan’s notes as well as spent a ton of time working with Jordan’s widow who was also his editor to really nail down a satisfying conclusion. The only complaint I’ve heard is that one of the characters personality shifts a bit but I didn’t really notice when I was first reading it. Sanderson has said himself that he focused too much on the archetype of the character and not enough on the person himself.

Because I saw the false starts, the errors, the drafts and redrafts, I emerged, quite young, with a sense that The Lord of the Rings and his other work had not simply sprung full-grown from the high brow of easy genius, but that long, diligent work might produce something. I was desensitized, in a way, to intimidation.” 


I wish more writers were able to do deep dives into the drafts and notes of Tolkien-esque works simply to build their own craft and have that access to that type of mentorship through material access. 




I TOTALLY agree about Rhianna Pratchett - honour her father’s wish for his own notes and ideas to be destroyed but have her own stories in his world. I don’t think he’d have minded that as much but then she’s the best source on how to deal with his  estate and his wishes.","lvhjmma"

These have been releasing and they have been good and even match his art style. 

Similarly, Togashi, Hunter Hunters creator who is always sick and ill has the series already mapped out. His wife is the creator of Sailor Moon. She and his team will finish if he passes or becomes fully unable to draw.

In practice, whether a book is good or whether it honors the recently departed author is probably not that different.

"lvjelho","Extrovert_89","2024-11-05 15:52:01 UTC","My boyfriend notices smaller differences than me, so he spotted a difference in Mat's character, but I guess it made sense to me- long series, the characters are tired of needing to fight, do this, do that..so I didn't notice big differences.

It was also the first long high fantasy series (anything longer than 7 books in my world) I read. I had been in a thriller rut for years and my boyfriend had me read Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy before Wheel of Time so I wouldn't be so overwhelmed.

He's a big Sanderson fan and is excited about the next Stormlight Archives book next month.","lviluxu"
"lvj9fww","Socalgardenerinneed","2024-11-05 15:26:22 UTC","Based on how the last few books Jordan wrote kept unspooling the story rather than resolving anything, I'm convinced Sanderson actually did a better job of closing out the series than we would have gotten otherwise. 

We'd either have several more books, or we'd be in a Game of Thrones situation where we never got the last couple books.","lviluxu"
"lvjhm33","Major2Minor","2024-11-05 16:06:51 UTC","Sanderson on the other hand seems like a very disciplined author, can always rely on him to finish what he started it seems, unlike some authors (looking at you GRRM and Rothfuss!).","lviluxu"

"lvl0ex0","ShadowDV","2024-11-05 20:33:06 UTC","Eh, opinions… I think Sanderson was the best thing to happen to the series.  To each their own.

Although, he already had published the first Mistborn trilogy, and Elantris before TGS, published Warbreaker the same year as TGS, then Way of Kings the same year as ToM.  I don’t think it’s fair to say he used WoT as training wheels.","lvi74fj"

Now you could certainly argue that his wife could have picked a BETTER author...","lvi74fj"

Legally, they were not married so I should not have used the term ""widow"" in that she was the wife he left behind when he died.  They had been long term partners.  I believe for something like 17 years?  I read somewhere, but haven't fact-checked, that the only reason they didn't marry was because their marriage would make their address public information.  Given his speaking out against Neo-Nazis, he didn't want his address public knowledge.  As far as I understood, however, they were, for all intents and purposes, married.  So I would believe, despite the legality, she considered herself his widow.","lvkilev"

> Christopher Tolkien has commented that “almost every substantial change”, made to his father’s manuscripts for publication as The Silmarillion in 1977, was:

> “discussed with Guy Kay. He indeed made many suggestions for the construction of the text (such as, in the tale of Beren and Lúthien, the introduction of a passage from the Lay of Leithian), and proposed solutions to problems arising in the making of a composite narrative — in some cases of major significance to the structure ... “","lvhqngy"
"lvj3i6s","KittyTheS","2024-11-05 14:55:45 UTC","I suppose it depends on what you consider ownership. To continue to use the Pratchetts and Tolkiens as examples, the children having had such intimate exposure to their parent's works and worlds to my mind gives them the absolute right to continue those worlds themselves - it is, after all, part of their own lived experience. Of course, any suggestion that they *should* just because they *can* is unthinkable, but if they *want* to, far be it from any of us to complain.

The line gets a little blurrier when it's an heir without literary aspirations themselves getting another writer without those direct connections to do the work but in that case I would find it hard to argue against the literal death of the author precluding them from continuing to hold an opinion.

In either circumstance I suppose all the audience has to decide is whether to buy it or not.","lvhqier"
"lvl4d3w","KittyTheS","2024-11-05 20:52:14 UTC","It helps that I don't have any real interest in how RP would write any of the existing characters (apart from *maybe* Nanny Ogg). Someone more invested might be a trifle disappointed if any hypothetical new stories didn't at least somewhat retread familiar ground, but I feel like that sort of nostalgia is antithetical to the underlying energy of the series and thus should be avoided at all costs.

(Although on that note I'd always be up for more witches in general because the audiobooks would be read by Indira Varma, who is the best).","lvkz8c6"
"lvyu2ll","KittyTheS","2024-11-07 21:20:29 UTC","To be fair I've never liked the Hitchhikers books all that much (apart from *Life, the Universe, and Everything*), as I greatly prefer the radio series and I've always had the impression that he did too. My favorite of Adams's actual books is *The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul* which has a lot in common with Artemis Fowl.

Conversely I find that Gareth Roberts' attempts to novelise Adams' Doctor Who episodes lack the same dryness of wit as the originals -- they're funny, but in a 'look how hard I tried to make this joke sound like Douglas wrote it' as opposed to 'this turn of phrase amuses me, I'm going to use it and I don't care if nobody else gets it because it amuses *me*.'","lvyny4l"

"lvj6poo","afroguy10","2024-11-05 15:12:24 UTC","Agreed, but there's definitely still varying levels of success, even though he can be a bit of a blank slate for authors.


As I mentioned, Gardner's novels are pretty poor and are generally regarded as so. If I remember right, he has Bond drink tea and buy a second house out in the country. Both things that Fleming had Bond mention multiple times how much he hated, especially tea! 


Speaking of though, the Bond comics can be pretty great as well.","lvj5ky9"
"lw51pi5","Ealinguser","2024-11-08 20:34:06 UTC","To me, it's more that the original James Bond books are so weak that you can't make them worse. The films are vastly better.","lvj5ky9"
"lw27nxw","afroguy10","2024-11-08 11:14:46 UTC","I loved Moonraker, it's nothing like the film, but it's a great Cold War thriller with a classic high stakes end of the world plot driven by an archetypal megalomaniacal industrialist Bond villain.


Other than that, Casino Royale, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and From Russia With Love are generally regarded as some of the better Bond novels. I also really enjoyed You Only Live Twice but it's a bit of a contentious one, some people really dislike it.","lvyonba"

But Neiderman and King pale in comparison to Orson Scott Card when it comes to pedo fan service.  We all got introduced to it in Ender's Game's soapy shower scene where a soapy and naked tween in a steamy shower gets in a fight with another naked tween in a steamy shower.  
  
But who can forget the child who's given chemical treatments to stop puberty and then grows up to find that those treatments cause a stroke and throws the child/man into a coma when he has his first orgasm?  
  
Or the tween boy who fathers a child on a witch who carries it to term in 24months so she can sacrifice it to gain witchy powers?  
  
Just about every one of his novels features a young, beautiful, lissome boy who overcomes obstacles by being young, beautiful, and lissome, and frequently naked.  It's his signature theme.  Which is weird since he's vocally homophobic but insists that he doesn't associate pedophilia with homosexuality.  
  
It's tough, because other than the highly uncomfortable pedophilia, his writing is breathtakingly beautiful.  I have the most difficult time separating art from artist.","lvhodqe"

However, when every (or nearly every) novel or piece of writing has the main female character relying solely on sexual abuse and trauma, this tells me that the writer sees women, especially young woman and girls as only having a personality based on their abuse. 

There is also no reason for a minor aged character to have any part of their genitalia or secondary sexual characteristics (such as breasts and nipples) spoken about at any length. 

I do not need to know what a little girls nipples look like. There’s no excuse for that.","lvvp5i8"
