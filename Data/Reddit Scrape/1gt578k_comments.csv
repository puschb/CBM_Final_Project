For your first language, a dictionary might be helpful as your daily linguistic environment helps to reinforce your new vocabulary. But for a foreign language that you are learning out of the context, a brief peek into the dictionary just won't last.

I've started on English around age 8 or something, and the lessons are useless for me except for the very basics. I learnt through computer games, talk shows, films and rap music with double subtitles. Only then do I dare to test my English with science fictions and fantasy novels, and then to more serious academic readings. I could skip through the few new words now without harming my understanding of the entire article. My experience with Spanish and French is basically the same.

BTW this is kind of off topic, but I would like to recommend a RPG game called Disco Elysium, in which you could use a single hotkey to switch between English and your chosen language at any time during the gameplay. I would normally play in English but switch to my native tongue whenever I bumped into some complicated postmodernism phrase.

The writers you read also help. If I read a Raymond Carver, I doubt I'll find words new to me, maybe some regionalism or dated slang, nothing against those. But if I really want to bulk up my vocabulary, then reading Joyce, Nabokov, Cormac McCarthy, John Banville, anything by Alexander Theroux is a much wiser decision. Of course a healthy reading life isn't made of just those authors.

I should add I do love to collect words.

"lxlokip","Braign","2024-11-17 15:16:27 UTC","As a teen I would power through on context clues alone - I had no dictionary, no idea how to look things up, and some entire phrases were so unfamiliar to me that it was hard to put them into context, let alone parse the meaning.

For example, I was reading a book, the book that would become one of my favourite books of all time, and I read the phrase ""unctuously idolatrous"" as describing a character. Most characters in this book were in the 'morally grey' area, not good or bad. So I had zero context for each individual word, nor for both words together. I asked a teacher and she also did not know. I also didn't have a clue, at that time, how to turn those words into words I could look up individually - 'unctuous' and 'idolatry', and even once I realised how to do that, I didn't think to, I had long forgotten that phrase.

I spent a long time with no clue, but I randomly learned what 'unctuous' meant years later, I don't remember how. Maybe on a cooking show. And I learned about idolatry from watching a movie I think, maybe The Ten Commandments. So when I re-read the book in my 20's, I realised I knew what it meant. What had baffled me at 15 now seemed obvious.

Now, I don't find many books where I come across unfamiliar words - mostly in part because I read for fun. I read Clan of the Cave Bear and it had many names of plants I wasn't familiar with, but I knew they were plants, so I didn't feel the need to look those up. It had one word I wasn't familiar with - 'reconnoiter' - I estimated based on context clues, then looked it up to see how close I was.",""

Please note, I also mentioned etymology, root, prefixes, suffixes, etc in this thread. I was answering a question on an Internet forum, not some UN language forum. I answered a direct question without hours of thought and research.

I was also speaking in terms of reading. When a word such as “iridescent” appears when describing a bug, you can understand what the word means just from its quality. If you imagine a bland, boring beetle off of the word “iridescent” as opposed to a chromatic-like rainbow-ish green, that’s your teacher’s problem. “Iridescent” is close to “viridian” even, back to my point on the construction of words.

When you bring up phonetics, well you can mees wyth thee silablés, or make a reference or infer, or really quite a bit, back to your point about “context clues”. There are a lot more words to describe this as well.

Reading is much more slower paced and allows for thought on scene, spelling, and other ways of determining “context clues”.","lxnbi7v"
