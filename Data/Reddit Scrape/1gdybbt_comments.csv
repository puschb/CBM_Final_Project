"lu63rth","caught_red_wheeled","2024-10-28 13:02:16 UTC","Book post:

I tore through **A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens!** I forgot how much I loved that story! It’s a bit weird reading a Christmas story around Halloween, but it doesn’t diminish it any way! I remember seeing it as a play with my dad years ago and it was awesome! The story is simple but so well done, and especially the ghost of Christmas future is still such an intense character! I never realized Dickens wrote it after all these years but it might just be my favorite of his works!

I also decided to have a change of pace and read **Don Quixote La Mancha by Miguel Cervantes**. I went all the way across my new state to my first state fair recently so I figured that was appropriate for when I was in the car. It turned out to be a good pick regardless. 

I took a lot of Spanish courses before I went to college and then eventually got my degree as a double major in Spanish and English education. I wanted to become a Spanish teacher, but that didn’t really work out and instead I’m an English teacher with a lot of knowledge about Spanish and the culture around it. What all this means that I basically grew up on Don Quixote but only abridged versions appropriate for the amount of Spanish I knew. This is my first time reading it in English, and my first time reading the whole thing.

One of the things my instructors always used to say is that the more someone reads the book, the more the reader can believe he is a real knight. After reading it, I am inclined to agree and I was hooked from the very beginning. I also find it hilarious, even though I can’t understand all of it due to the language being a bit different than when I’m used to reading. I know it gets pretty serious and sad in the second part, but for now I’m enjoying the humor and a bit of a change of pace from the more intense things.

On another note, I just finished reading about the young adult fiction story **Warriors: Star.** It’s a bit of an odd case because it’s a long-running series and I used to read the books as they came out. However, I would read pretty quickly and it became too expensive to sustain. This got even worse with some of the side stories, which I couldn’t even get access to. I eventually discovered a site where some people will get access to the books early and post the spoilers. So I started reading there instead. 

I wanted to try and go as long as the books were, but the problem was that it was became very difficult to keep up. And optional side content I could safely skip before was no longer that way. The fans were understandably more and more upset the more content was released that was hard to keep up with and also the predictability. And it was just stressful to engage with that. So after this arc, I made the decision to no longer follow the series.

I originally thought about abandoning it after midway through this arc, but decided to just stick it through because I liked the characters. Unfortunately, this arc fell to the same issues that others have and that’s predictability. 

Without going into spoilers since no one is even supposed to have the book yet, everyone could see what was happening at the end a mile away but was hoping it was something else. And as usual, that wasn’t the case. The problem as well is that one of the major developments took place in one of the optional side stories, but it was advertised as something extra involving a different character when that’s really not what it is. 

From a business perspective I can understand both decisions entirely. The series has been going for over 20 years and sometimes is at the top of the charts. When the authors have tried to do something completely new, it hasn’t really worked out. So it’s a case of if it’s not broke don’t fix it. And putting required content behind the side stories entices people to read it. I feel bad for the authors as well, because they have tried to branch out into other franchises. But every single time it’s pretty much failed even if the writing is solid. So this is really the only way they and the editors can make money, and that just is rather sad. 

It’s an example of what happens when a series goes on for way too long, but no one really has any choice. I think this as is popular as it is because there’s just a lot of lore and worldbuilding , which is still going, but there just comes a point when no one can do a lot with that world. And I think that’s where the books are now. If the blurbs are true for the next arc, it sounds like the characters may move to an entirely new area. Which makes sense given what’s gone on in the last few arcs, but it means things have gotten to the point where the current world is exhausted. And that’s happened twice already. At that point I wonder if they thought of making a new series but unfortunately there was the money issues as mentioned. No matter what, no one wins, even if things started off good.",""

Plowed through this in less than a week. I found this one to be uproariously funny. I really want to read more of this series now!

**Henry IV, Part One, by William Shakespeare**

Finished the play and I liked it well enough. I'm looking forward to starting Part Two. Move over Prince Hal, Falstaff is the real star of this play. 3.5 stars.

**The River of Silver, by S. A. Chakraborty**

I liked it but didn't love it. The extra side stories added but could have done without. 3 stars.

**Story of a Soul, by St. Thérèse of Lisieux**

Last episode of the third season of the *Catholic Classics* podcast dropped this morning and I promptly listened and followed along. I found the commentary insightful but the book itself a bit dull. 3 stars.

Ongoing:

**Nicholas Nickleby, by Charles Dickens**

Issue No. 5 (Chapters 15-17). More to the ongoing story of our titular hero and his sister. This one is starting to grow on me after a kind of tepid start.

"lub4nnj","One_Engineering8030","2024-10-29 06:07:59 UTC","Over the weekend, I started a book that I finished this morning, Monday. And that book is called “the collector“, written by. John Fowell. I apologize if the authors name is spelled incorrectly I am composing this post via voice to text because I am blind, and this device does not have a keyboard. The book was published in 1963 and the audiobook that I listened to was from the national library of Congress Here in the United States and that audiobook was originally recorded on real real tape or something, and was recorded in 1964. They chose a great narrator because the quality of the recording and the narrator himself really set the tone for the time period that the story took place in and it made The wording of the story feel a lot more natural hearing it recorded in the era in which such language seemed normal for the time rather than a modern voice actor, trying to emulate words that they don’t say with the correct cadence or delivery. 

I thought the first half of the book was interesting, but I felt like it was missing something because it was really all told from the point of view of a main character, whose ideas and plans are completely reprehensible. But you’re only seeing the story through his eyes. it wasn’t until somewhere around the midpoint of the book where it suddenly flips over to another character telling their experience of these events from their point of view and comparing and contrasting the difference between how the events went, according to one person and with the other person was thinking and experience at the time. Or I should say it did not necessarily compare contrast through the second character, but the statements made by that second character, the reader to compare and contrast the points of view and the actions of each from each person’s perspective. And I was really happy that that second character was able to more fully flush themselves out as a character Rather than nothing more than a pawn with no backstory or death. 

I spent the whole book wondering which way the story was going to end and one of the reasons I’m very happy with this book is because it ended way that I did not expect, and it was gut wrenching, yet completely true to character for one of the main characters to Allow the story to progress the way that it did. It was not the ending I expected, and I really appreciated the way. The author showed every step of the decision-making that went into the final interactions between these characters. 

And for those that have read the book or plan to read the book there is a section of the book that is not marked as an epilogue in the audiobook recording, and I don’t know if it is written as an epilogue in the book itself. But the end of the book that I’m referring to happens before section that I would consider an epilogue and the web while the epilogue Job by the epilogue rules around as I call it, the epilogue itself was a little bit predictable, but the ending that came right before it was not, and the only reason the epilogue felt a little predictable to me was because of the ending that came before it. The epilogue was just a great way to finish the story after the proceeding few pages or so we’re wrapped up at the end of part three. Oh and for that matter what I called the up log the book calls part four part four, but it is very short, comparatively speaking to the rest of the book. 

And I don’t know the exact page count of the book but as an audiobook, it was approximately 9 1/2 hours which is somewhere around the average size of a typical detective type novel, even though this is not a detective novel. I’m just using it as comparison. 

I think the genre of this book was marked as psychological suspense fiction where I had downloaded it from. And I got the suggestion for this book over in the suggest me a book read it after somebody else had asked for certain types of books and this one was recommended in that other thread. And I’m really glad I downloaded it. It was a quick read That was hard to put down. And I can’t say enough how happy I am that the characters were flushed out as they were. And also how much they delve into the mindset of terry characters in the latter half of the book. And I think the book could leave a lot open for discussion about One of the main characters feelings for a terry character, and the latter half of the book and regardless of what that character think their interactions with that character may or may not be completely inappropriate and or predatory predatory. 

Thank you for reading this far. I am sure that there is a lot of strange words and all that text up there because I am composing this voice to text and auto correct on the like tend to just do their own thing sometimes. So I apologize if that is a particularly difficult read .",""

I had heard Sanderson being congratulated on his worldbuilding and magic systems and while they were strong points of the book they still left a lot to be desired. 

It was not irredeemable, however. The book certainly picks up by the last fotrh, after the dragging expositions are out of the way. And while the magic system itself wasn't anything revolutionary, there were some very clever applications. Also, I'm a sucker for some of the clichés, apparently, because I enjoyed the balls for the most part. 

There was something good somewhere in there, but it got overshadowed by the many weak points to be enjoyable at the end. One of my most earnest compliments would be how easy and quickly you can get through the book.

A post apocalyptic society where due to radiation levels from a World War most of society has moved off earth to Mars leaving only those damaged enough to be ineligible for emigration, the mentally deficient, and the administration and police. Most healthy emigres were offered an android servant to encourage their leaving but earth has banned the humanoid androids and worship anything organic and natural life forms. Everyone covets the dwindling pets and animals as a status symbol and those unable to afford pets purchase robotic animals to cover their shame.  As the androids on Mars are so advanced that they cannot be distinguished from human, some of them have begun to return to earth secretly for emancipation. Rick Deckard is an officially sanctioned bounty hunter who is tasked with the 'retiring' of these rogue androids. I enjoyed this classic SF novel which is credited for being the inspiration for the film Blade Runner.

Finished: **Nightwork, by Nora Roberts**  (Audiobook narrated by Will Damron)

Harry Booth is a sneak thief who started stealing at a young age to support his family. His father was never in the picture and his mother and her sister survived by running a home cleaning service. When his mother was fighting cancer he began to steal and becomes more and more adept as he gets older. He is contracted to steal a painting by another thief who due to an injury tripping over his dog cannot fulfil a contract with a wealthy collector.  This wealthy collector becomes his nemesis when he must have Harry to do further crimes for him and he will not accept no for an answer. The book follows his life and struggles with growing up and dealing with his mothers death, and finding his own love and way in the world. I found this book interesting but a trifle long winded. Perhaps it is the female author's perspective, with which I am not accustomed, but it tended to seem overly explanatory of some things and lacked focus on others. Probably my fault, Others would enjoy it I'm sure. The narration was very well done.

I was (somehow) aware of Roman Charity, so it didn't seem too out of place to me, but I could see why some might think it was ""weird.""

I'm about a third of the way through this. I didn't pick it out for any certain reason - it was on my shelf and I'm intentionally trying to read more classics. But I guess given that today is Halloween, it sort of fits.

The language is a \\*bit\\* more formal, probably given its age, but it isn't hard to comprehend. I don't know much about what it's supposed to be about. Is it anything more than a good scary story? I can see a theme being something about man being too ambitious and trying to become God, but Shelley's introduction made it sound like it just came to her when trying to think of something spooky. I'll see what I think of the rest of it but it's going well so far.",""

I will say I enjoyed this book, but conditionally.

I liked the character development and how new faces seem to emerge from the background over time; it reminded me of how Only Murderers in the Building takes a different POV each episode and takes you deep into their backstory, relevant or not. What I didn't like, nor expect, was the soap opera-iness as the book evolved. The book ultimately became a light romance novel. 3/5, unlikely to ever reread.

Started:

The Summer Tree by Guy Gavriel Kay (book One of the Fionavar Trilogy)

I'm on about halfway through this, and the enjoyment lies very heavily on Kay's beautiful prose. This is an older fantasy novel, so it pulls a lot from classic tropes and is kind of somewhere between classic ""Portal Fantasy"" and ""Isekai"". The main 5 characters are not written equally, and so far, there are some that are just so much deeper than others. Paul and Jennifer are currently my favorites while Kim kind of sits in a cabin learning the secrets of Fionavar, Kevin sleeps with a bunch of fantasy ladies, and Dave is lost somewhere in Fionavar?

* **The Shadow of the Gods, by John Gwynne** 
* **The Hunger of the Gods, by John Gwynne**

Found this book highly recommended on Goodreads or booktok or somewhere and thought I'd start, didn't even know the trilogy book was coming out this week and had started by the time I did. 

These are fun books in that the change of scenery to a Norse inspired world is fun, the plot moves along at a decent pace, and sensible motivations are established for all characters. These books are not fun for several other reasons: two of three POVs in the first book blend together (Battle-Grim, Bloodsworn), there are fantasy creatures with confusing descriptions, and the POV of one character is trouble+conflict+everyone is dead+repeat. 

The second book helps elevate the first because the characters are consistent with their actions or motivations and the plot is moved along at a nice pace. The combat descriptions are still tiring in my opinion in that they are long and non-emotive for the reader, mostly character exposition. An added POV is maybe the most interesting character. 

Overall 3/5 series (a little lower on the first, a little higher on the second) and I'm looking forward to the final book for the story outcomes.

e nitpik: I'm pretty sure East-West get confused several times by the same characters at some points and the boating around versus the map is confusing at times",""

I have a box set of spooky classics that I got last year for Halloween. Includes Dracula, Frankenstein, some Poe, some HP Lovecraft, and this. I wanted to fit in one more spooky book this month and this one was short so I checked it out. 

Taking it at face value, I found the book pretty bland. It was hard to get used to the prose, being that it was written 125 years ago by what I'm guessing was a British highbornman. And not a lot happens in the book. The main question of the book seems to be whether the narrator is an unreliable loon or if she really is seeing ghosts. It was interesting, but not enough for me.

I actually had a lot more fun reading discussion about the book. Some people love the book and I wanted to know why. One theory that was intriguing to me was that the narrator is attracted to the young boy (and he in return to her) and that her guilt over this created these ghosts in her mind in order to justify her clinging to the boy (to protect him!), visiting his bedroom at night, and sending away the others to be alone with him. There were multiple instances in the book of things that came across as sexually charged that I just chalked up to my modern mind misreading innocent wording from a bygone era. I think it'd be interesting to reread the book again with those theories in mind - not for a while though. That book was a slog to get through!",""

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I really liked this book, especially how Törzs didn't hand hold the reader too much at the start with answering the mysteries raised in earlier chapters. I also think Törzs did a really good job of building suspense in various scenes. The magic system was also a really interesting idea.

However, the pacing off the book was very lopsided, the first half very slow and the second quite fast. I also think the magic system never explored its full potential. There were so many cool possibilities, but Törzs basically stuck to three very common magical concepts. I would have liked to have seen a more creative use of magic in the conclusion. As it stands, this is more of a mystery novel facilitated by some magic. The romance that occurs in the final third of the book also feels a little shoe horned in.

**Love Ain't Nothing but Sex Misspelled: Stories, by Harlan Ellison**  
Not my favourite collection but there were a handful of stories that really stood out for me. One about a Nazi youth and another about a “medical procedure” gone wrong were particularly absorbing.  

**This Much is True, by Miriam Margolyes**  
Anyone who’s seen MM on Graham Norton, will know what to expect from this autobiography, and she did not disappoint. But aside from ‘who’s who’ of MM’s life, her sexual escapades, and some political opinions this wasn’t a particularly deep or memorable read.  

**The Enormous Room, by E.E. Cummings**  
I was somewhat taken aback by all the lukewarm/negative reviews of this book; I guess this is where our subjective experiences come into play, for I enjoyed it tremendously. Just the sheer pantheon of characters and the author’s fascinating and often hilarious observations kept me superglued to the book. There is a chapter dedicated to the imprisoned women, where the author describes how he was disabused of the notion of the weaker sex, that was totally unexpected. Loved this book and its irreverent, sarcastic, and hopeful tone.  

**Abortion and the Law in America, by Mary Ziegler**  
This was a step-by-step political history of abortion debate since Roe v Wade. Whilst the book predates the Dobbs Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe and Casey rulings, it is nonetheless an exceptionally well-chronicled narrative that distilled the arguments from the opposing sides (and occasionally some inner camp disagreements) to their most cogent points. This was not written with the view to sway the reader toward either of the positions but to simply provide a nuanced and unbiased historical account, which I thought it did commendably.

**Illusionology, by Albert Schafer**

Again, this one not having Dugald on it shows. I do really like the subject matter, but found parts of this repetitive. On one page they literally mentioned doing a motion with one hand to pickpocket with the other three times. Also, I felt like mentioning sources for the book at the end in tiny text kind of stunk. One of the reasons I love this series is they often mention other actual works so if a topic really sparks a kid's interest they can go look up those books. Them being hidden like this doesn't give them a logical next step.

**Dirty Biology, by Leo & Colas Grasset**

Picked this up off a display at the library, it seemed funny enough flipping through it, so I checked it out.

**Dinosaurology, by Raleigh Rimes**

I believe this one also didn't have Dugald involved. Already just from some cursory glances I believe this is going to be about finding an island where dinosaurs and people co-exist. That seems a bit close to religious myths to me, but also given these books are typically set back in time when their subject matter was gaining popularity and the wealth of mis-information around dinosaurs it makes sense they went this route to avoid a lot of that mis-info.

Story of WWII London. I really enjoyed it.

Two young women move to London just before WWII. They live with an older woman who a good friend of the main character's mom, who has died a few years earlier. 

It starts before war is declared. Then how quiet things are in London as Hitler sweeps across Europe leaving England standing alone. As a reader I was taken through the Blitz and terrible damage and the people's determination.

The main character is not a reader, but she grows to be. It is exciting to feel her discover a love of books.",""

**The Ersatz Elevator, by Lemony Snickett**. Good, easy fun.

**The Mongols - A Very Short Introduction, by Morris Rossabi**. Very short indeed, but really piqued my interest and helped situate the short-lived Mongol empire in time for me. I found the scheming, in-fighting political manoeuvring quite interesting, and the ways the Mongol Khans tried to balance legitimizing their rule in the eyes of the occupied people and maintaining Mongol traditions. Sorghaghtani Beki stood out to me as a really interesting figure that I'd like to learn more about.

Started:

**Passwords, by Jean Baudrillard**. Supposed to be a nice, easy place to start with this guy, being essentially a brief introduction to the key concepts of his philosophy. I find myself able to understand the individual words and sentences, and sometimes even the individual paragraphs, but I find myself constantly getting to the end of a chapter with no idea what that chapter was even supposed to be about. Still, the bits that do make some sort of sense have been quite interesting...

**Magic - A Very Short Introduction, by Owen Davies**. Very interesting so far. A good mix of different perspectives on magic, from anthropological, historical, psychological, etc. Examines the different ways the word magic has been applied through time and space, and a the sometime tenuous differences between magic and religion and between magic and science.

Ongoing:

**Dracula, by Bram Stoker**. I'm liking this a lot more than I thought I would. The characters are all interesting, the shifting perspectives works really well, the tension builds magnificently. I only wish I could experience what it would have been like this to read this without already knowing exactly who/what Dracula is. It must have been *wild* to pick this book up back in the 1890's.

* **A Thousand Ships by Natalie Haynes**-Even among a lot of greek mythology retellings, I liked this a lot. The framing was really unique, and the story being mostly just little vignettes of different characters worked bettern than a linear story would have done.  

* **The Ten Thousand Doors Of January by Alix E Harrow**-I was pleasantly surprised by this, I feel like it had a lot more substance than I expected. The prose was very beautiful, but it also tackled some interesting themes. 

* **A Narrow Door by Joanne Harris**-I loved this book, Harris' thriller novels are always so fun. The main character did nothing wrong, everything she did was totally justified. 

* **The Light of the Midnight Stars by Rena Rossner**-This book was pretty heavy at times, but I loved the less common setting. I liked how it encompassed a lot of eastern european folk tales. 

* **Four Treasures of the Sky by Jenny Zhang**-Well, this book was depressing, but I can't say I regret reading it. I'm always happy to read diverse and interesting stories, because it's a new perspective I wouldn't have known about otherwise. 

Not from the library but I decided to reread:  

* **Cemetery Boys by Aiden Thomas**-I've read this about a dozen times by now and it's still so good. It's just a really sweet story, I love how it combines the magic realism vibes with a contemporary YA narrative and some funky central american mythology.   

New books from the library: 

* **Faebound by Saara El-Arifi**- I've had my eye on this for a long time, I liked the author's previous novel and it looked very good. 

* **Piranesi by Susanna Clarke**-Another novel that I've heard good things about but haven't got round to actually buying.

* **Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line by Deepa Anappara**-I'm a huge fan of urban fantasy crime novels, and this just looked interesting.

* **Masters of Death by Olivie Blake**-My library had a halloween display, and I felt like I had to grab something off it. I've never read any olivie blake, it'll be interesting to see what I think of it.

Varg as the purest vengeance seeker that finds something more was close behind and well written but the love interest seemed shoe horned at the end when I was thinking they had a very different dynamic.
Orka continuing to be a death machine with combat-writing being a weak point in the series for me I was see-sawing, especially because she was in the coolest locations.
Elvar was one of my favorites in Hunger but made some stupid decisions this book that I didn’t think fit her. Could’ve been more upfront that Grend put her in a tough spot to keep the war party together but knowing it was the wrong thing, especially when she’d never really taken a stance on Tainted before.

What would you do differently if you could live your adult life all over again? >!Not travel the world or exercise altruism, apparently.!< A somewhat insular, white American centric take on an existential question. Fun nostalgia from the 60's through the 80's. 3/5 stars

Delinquent guy Morio has a chance encounter with a blind girl, Yukiko, and is instantly taken with her.


But that's just the basic setup. This was a series that never failed to astound me at the sheer amount of heart that it put forth. And I don't just mean with the whole romantic progression between the main characters either. This series went there in addressing some serious topics and went about them in a realistic way without like glorifying it. And on both sides of it too. I mean, in other stories I've seen in my life you'd see the disabled girl meeting an idyllic guy who gradually breaks her out of a shell she's built around herself. And while that certainly did happen here in ways it also was by no means a one way street. Morio wasn't exactly what people would call an idyllic guy, especially at the beginning. But in a way both he and Yukiko were similar. People/society would just look at the two of them and label or make the snap judgements ""delinquent"" and ""disabled person"". But I think it's through that unique circumstance that they share (plus Yukiko's blindness granting her the circumstance at not being able to make those same snap judgements) that allowed them to look past those labels and see each other as the persons they are. And it's through their interacting and bonding with each other that encouraged them to want to become better versions of themselves. Yukiko putting herself out there and really finding out just what she's capable of doing on her own. And Morio's general journey to better himself was interesting at how it was reinforced by his sense of earnestness. Yeah he doesn't always get things, especially stuff about what it means to be disabled, but as he asks questions and learns and gains perspective he takes those things to heart and gives them due consideration at his own preconcieved notions and adjusts. He's still a guy just muddling through things, but he does really really care. And that makes him a good guy. And of course there's also how these two ended being the catalyst that fueled other character's growth and change throughout the story.



But I think I've rambled long enough here. This story nailed it at being what it set out to do. Being a heartwarming romance while also providing insight on a lot of enriching thought provoking topics.",""

Alberta examined several subjects including the Falwell family, Charlie Kirk, Russell Moore, Eric Metaxas, the Southern Baptist Convention, and Rachael Denhollander, who helped litigate sexual abuse cases against prominent Christian organizations. It’s a challenging read if you’re a Christian and are disheartened to see your faith misused and disregarded for the pursuit of political power and to wage cultural wars, which leads to alienating certain demographics that needed Christian ministry the most.

**An Honest Woman: A Memoir of Love and Sex Work, by Charlotte Shane**

This was like junk food for the mind. Shane tells the story of how she entered the sex work field. Instead of a collection of stories, it mainly centers on her “relationship” with client Roger. If you’re looking for a sexy weekend read, this may scratch that itch.

**The Use of Photography, by Annie Ernaux, Marc Marie, Alison L. Strayer (translator)**

This is an interesting collection of morning-after photos of clothing tossed around on the floor, with Ernaux and Marie each recounting the events surrounding them in essays. Nothing too sexually explicit is discussed; it is more about remembering events of the past, how they got to that point in their lives and their health struggles.

"lv9hlvh","nethescurial666","2024-11-03 23:30:12 UTC","Just finished reading Veingloria by Asher Sharol. It's pretty new (released this past summer). I am surprised at how much I enjoyed it given I don't normally read dark/paranormal fantasy. Something about it was original, and the prose was quite refreshing. It's about a teenage vampire, ""Gloria"", who is enrolled in a witches' Sisterhood (Beltraine). Of course, the witches have no clue she's a vampire (except one... from whom she feeds to survive). And if the witches do discover her secret, they would burn her to a crisp with fire-based magic. Complicating matters for Gloria is the fact that she's also the only Channeler at the Sisterhood (a Channeler is someone from whom the witches pull energy in order to fuel powerful, group-based magic... ironically to ritually kill vampires). And since the witches regularly perform this ritual (called the Chain of Glory), Gloria has to be constantly in the spotlight as the witches kill beings like her. Of note are the three ancient nun-like Headmistresses of Beltraine who are legendary witches with plenty of dark secrets. They pose the most threat to unearthing Gloria's secret with their almost godlike abilities. Each of them has a vestal (a wraith-like aspect of themselves who float about the Beltraine grounds searching for anything strange. In my opinion, their ghastly nature is hardly something you'd want to have around teenagers since they can easily kill.  
  
 The story also follows Tamsyn Blackcross, the daughter of the vampire King, who hides a secret of her own (she's a witch), which will mark her for death if her father or any member of the other vampire houses finds out. Tamsyn is on a quest to find out who her mother is since she's been absent since her birth. Also, she shares a romantic connection with a member of a rival vampire house, which her father violently opposes. Nevertheless, Tamsyn chooses to pursue this romance nevertheless with grave consequences. The suspense and drama was palpable while reading this, and I kept turning the pages to see what would happen next. I highly recommend it for fans of the genre. If anyone reads this please let me know what you think about it.",""

It's maybe worth remembering that Mary Shelley's mother died shortly after she was born. He father, while a kind and brilliant man, was too wracked with grief to be a good parents. Mary was still a teenager when she wrote Frankenstein, but she had already buried her first child, which died only eleven days after it was born, still unnamed. So, while she may have just been trying to think of something spooky, its perhaps not surprising that questions of the creation of life, and the responsibility of the creator to their creations, and what can go wrong when the creators fail to meet those responsibilities, were all buzzing around in her head already.","lupf7jt"

I like the descriptions but, the thing is, I was reading it in my native language and that maybe be one of the reasons why I couldn't fully immerse myself into the book and feel all the things that the author wanted me to feel. I think the feeling would've been better if I was reading it English because I don't think that the translation gave the author's words their justice. However, it is interesting to read a book that is written in the 1800s by a male that depicts this kind of relationship between two females (I won't spoil what kind). It's more of a psychological description of the character, not so much action.","lu5o4np"

It’s a bit softer in themes when compared to the consequences of power in the Catholic Church in Small Things Like These. Still super good and made me cry but I thought it didn’t hit quite as hard as STLT.
