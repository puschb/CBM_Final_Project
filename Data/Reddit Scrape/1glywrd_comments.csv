He stepped closer and said, ‘You’re either for the Führer or against him – and I can see that you’re against him.

Neil Postman wrote Amusing Ourselves to Death discussing how television media, more specifically television news, and infotainment would erode public discourse and critical thinking. Modern entertainment is the real life soma. 

It's funny how a book from 1985 more or less predicted our situation where people addicted to certain news channels and podcast networks would ultimately sleepwalk into voting away rights and economic freedom.","lvy8lzb"

"lvzdnfd","octnoir","2024-11-07 22:56:58 UTC","Capitalism is a ever changing and transformative Kaiju that is able to seamlessly transform to react to just about any opposition to it. Radiation? Hey it shoots laser beams! Cut off its leg? Don't worry, it will hyper regenerate. Blind it? Hey it's got echo location!

You'll see protests about e.g. worker's rights because of horrific labor abuse, created by capitalists, and at the same time the protestors being sold picket signs, T-shirts, water bottles and website spots by other capitalists. 

Case in point, two fairly popular anti-capitalist or capitalist satire shows, Andor and The Boys are airing, and Andor is produced by Disney, demi-god of capitalism, and The Boys is produced by Amazon, the eldritch god of capitalism. 

Capitalists are going to make profits either way because when the dominant system is capitalism, at some point you need to play by its rules even if you hate it or want to reform it, to survive.

The only consistent way capitalism has died, unfortunately, is via the cancer called Fascism, which has erupted around the world similar to several cancers, to adapt to the global mass export of capitalism. Fascists are able to get quick buy in from Capitalists by promising them unlimited immediate short term power, which gets massive buy in via their infinite greed, and simultaneously their destruction. (cause spoilers - with no regular institutions billionaires are regularly falling out of windows in Russia, getting disappeared in China and getting jailed in hotels in Saudi Arabia. Hitler famously didn't get 'prop up the market' and get infinite wealth because *everyone fucking died*). 

It is worth pointing out that fascists, authoritarians and conservatives only see capitalism as a means to an end. They are fully supportive of it until capitalists decide it isn't worth catering to them economically, and then all the fierce opposition starts. 

Going back to Disney, because of social progress there are now large pockets of previously discriminated minorities, so Disney produces show to cater to them, and in turn normalizing the presence of communities like LGBTQ+. The primary motive is clearly profit as opposed to furthering social progress (even if they get genuine buy in from diverse talent. Conservatives love claiming now it's selfish or that the 'DEI' is taking over and ignoring that the behind the scenes often those very same diverse talent genuinely trying to do a good thing getting hamstrung and harassed by corporate overlords). *Conservatives hated that shit*, so Disney was in regular boycott and in regular fights with Ron Desantis.","lvy8lzb"

And most essays written in english aren’t available easily anywhere else than amazon when you’re not in the US/UK etc so it’s not easy to forego. Encouraging to order elsewhere than amazon when feasible is a good idea but I don’t think it’s unreasonable that many have to use it unfortunately. If this awful company has managed to be so huge it’s for a reason too.

On the other hand, Darkness at Noon, from which Orwell took inspiration was magnificent.  Orwell borrowed heavily from it, but it is the story of one man who fell afoul of Stalin, arrested, and tried.  It's a very different sort of book, a meticulous account of prison life by a high ranking and ruthless Bolshevik.  

I wouldn't describe it as dystopic fiction.  I've seen it described as a political book - which it is. But it fits rather easily among post WW2 existentialist writing, sometimes reminding me of Mersault's imprisonment in The Stranger.  And it's interesting to compare to Orwell's 1984.","lvzhj29"

Homage to Catalonia is more or less a memoir about Orwell's personal experience fighting for the anarchists in the Spanish civil war. It is simply him relaying his experience, with *some* personal opinion, but not much. It should honestly just be viewed as a logbook of sorts. He is basically just telling you what is going on around him the entire book without much fluff.

It doesn't really touch on political themes all that much. Sure, you understand why things are the way they are in the book because of the various political factions, but the book doesn't really delve too deeply into any of that.

It's one of my favorite books because it's such a lighthearted and odd depiction of what it is like to be in the chaos of war. Only made extra chaotic because he was fighting with fucking **anarchists** who, by very definition, have an aversion to typical wartime organization hierarchies. They kind of just piss around and shoot people, get shot, and fuck up grenade throws.

It's a great book and I would truly suggest to anyone I meet that they read it. I've lent my copy out many times. But it is not an overt commentary on the dangers of fascism, or really even a cautionary tale about it at all.","lw0jbcs"

Edit: Dug up the quote since I wanted to read it again:  

> As we moved slowly through the outskirts of the town we passed row after row of little grey slum houses running at right angles to the embankment. At the back of one of the houses a young woman was kneeling on the stones, poking a stick up the leaden waste-pipe which ran from the sink inside and which I suppose was blocked. I had time to see everything about her—her sacking apron, her clumsy clogs, her arms reddened by the cold. She looked up as the train passed, and I was almost near enough to catch her eye. She had a round pale face, the usual exhausted face of the slum girl who is twenty-five and looks forty, thanks to miscarriages and drudgery; and it wore, for the second in which I saw it, the most desolate, hopeless expression I have ever-seen. It struck me then that we are mistaken when we say that ‘It isn’t the same for them as it would be for us,’ and that people bred in the slums can imagine nothing but the slums. For what I saw in her face was not the ignorant suffering of an animal. She knew well enough what was happening to her—understood as well as I did how dreadful a destiny it was to be kneeling there in the bitter cold, on the slimy stones of a slum backyard, poking a stick up a foul drain-pipe.","lvzmij7"

In the last 40 years it's become much less common to come across an opposing view and think ""hmmm"" and use it to examine the strength of your own conviction or moderate your views. Now it's strictly the enemy.

So now as a result, political races are competing fan clubs. It gives me real anxiety, not because of who you elect, that I can accept, but the absolute free ticket you've given them because we're now in a society where if I point out something wrong about your candidate you attack my one.

I'm a Canadian, so I've been watching all of this from the outside, and I don't see it.  I've also done national security research (in my case, strategic communications on countering the Jihadist message) during the War on Terror, so I know something about Islamist societies where this sort of oppression exists.  I've also got a minor background in law, so I've read the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe vs. Wade, and I know what it actually says and does.

The Handmaid's Tale is about a totalitarian society brought about by a revolution.  And, for all the activist left's complaints that Trump's victory will be a step on the road to it, the Supreme Court decision actually stated that abortion was an issue that needed to be dealt with on a state legislative level, by the people through their elected representatives, and returned the issue to the state legislatures.  So, it forced the states to address the issue in a way that was MORE democratic, not less.

Now, make no mistake, I'm a trained military historian and a Jew, and I've seen lots of signs that the United States may be only one generation away from its own Nuremberg Laws, so I don't fall under the ""it can't happen here"" category.  But, while I can absolutely see the far left, which espouses a racial Marxism that draws considerable comparisons to the Nazi's racist ideology and advocates for ""redistribution of power,"" passing laws openly discriminatory against specific ethnic groups (like Jews), the American public just rejected those identity politics in a really big way.  And the American right is based on individual freedoms (including a philosophy about gun ownership that has no match anywhere else in the world, as far as I know), smaller government, and individual responsibility - and they have the Oval Office, the Senate, and will probably take the House.

So where's the totalitarian revolution that looks at the Taliban and says ""that looks great - let's do that!""?  How do we get there?  What are the steps between right now and The Handmaid's Tale?","lwb1j9k"

You have people who are basically just abandoned by their families even though they have no way of independent living by themselves. They rely on Meals on Wheels to survive or are dependent on People Movers to do tasks as simple as getting groceries. Some of them struggle to even go to the toilet by themselves. And the American solution to this? Put them in a nursing home that are at capacity where they're even more likely to be poorly treated and exposed to dangers like infections that could kill them. Obviously, these highly sick people are not the ones out on the street yelling conspiracy theories but I think there are middle aged and elderly people who are physically healthier and able to devote their times to other activities but who still face similar issues of neglect and poor socialization. And the pandemic just exacerbated this to an extreme. I've seen cases of retired people turning to alcohol and drug abuse because they have nothing else to do--it's something you associated with young people, but it's risen a *lot* among the elderly. We've failed elderly people in this country, just as much we've failed Black people or poor people. And with the spike in Baby Boomers retiring, this problem is going to get worse and not better.

Here's what makes my point better than yours: When the Allied nations saw the Nazis being hateful towards others, they didn't try to reason with them or connect with them.

The difference is I want to fully understand both sides so I can make an informed decision and I can’t do that by simply dismissing anything that doesn’t agree with my narrow view. Even when I’ve made a decision I hope to learn more. You don’t. The world is a darker place for having such closed minds in it I’m afraid. You’re actually advocating for polarised views and lack of discussion and are utterly shook by the fact people turn to war, or totalitarian, extreme leaders. Sad.","lw3miq1"

The issue then is that is it healthy to be a black and white reductionist? And the answer is a resounding no.

I can disagree with a view while respecting a person. Anything else is rank arrogance that I don't wish to entertain.

You realise that the reason I want to understand their viewpoint and position better isn't out of doubt of mine, it's because I want to be open as it's a better state of being, and being close minded is worse *for me*.

What makes the world a darker place is extreme views and people unable to listen.

Also - just an aside. Human rights absolutely ARE NOT a black and white issue, we're debating them yesterday today and tomorrow and that's been the case for all of human history. Pretending otherwise is the mindset of an infant.

Are you familiar with how a termite burrows through a wooden structure? It starts with simply nibbling away at what seems like an immovable, rigid surface, but as it continues to nibble away it gradually gets deeper and deeper inside until it's right in the core and has completely compromised the structural integrity. The way you prevent that is to kill the termite before it is allowed to penetrate the surface.

Yes, because Project 2025 will take away what rights exist.

> Do you not have more rights today than you did 25 years ago?

No. *Mrs. Doubtfire* came out 30 years ago; back then, no one batted an eye about a man dressing up in drag in a popular comedy, but if that movie came out today the theatres that show it would be getting firebombed and the Internet would be malding over how ""woke"" the film is.

Abortion rights. Easy.

With you, ""understanding evil"" translates to ""I want to listen to them because I think they could be right.""

> I'm sorry your views are so fragile they are threatened by information I guess?

There is such a thing as too much information. A DDoS attack happens when an Internet server is flooded with more information than it can process, leaving it unable to fulfill its intended purpose. It's the same thing with political issues; too much information hinders the ability to take swift, decisive action that results in positive change.

> But that's ok? Amusing. The people you villify are doing the exact same

The only way to truly destroy evil is to beat it at its own game. The Allied nations met the Nazis on the same fields of battle that they'd previously won on when conquering Europe and defeated them there.","lw9yn47"

I don't consider the US to ever be a good example of human rights at any point in human history. The fact it's up for debate and changing literally tells you it isn't black and white though. In the US history on it's best day it had less human rights than large portions of europe.

I'm sorry your viewpoints are so fragile they can be eroded in such a matter. You thinking of a metaphor doesn't make it true unfortunately. 

>Yes, because Project 2025 will take away what rights exist.

So I'm correct then, they will change? I thought they were so black and white though? How can **anyone** possibly be convinced they aren't?!

>No. Mrs. Doubtfire came out 30 years ago; back then, no one batted an eye about a man dressing up in drag in a popular comedy, but if that movie came out today the theatres that show it would be getting firebombed and the Internet would be malding over how ""woke"" the film is. Human rights are moving backwards, and the fact that you don't see this and instead want to ""understand"" the people responsible makes you part of the problem, rather than the solution.

You are making a false equivalance I'm afraid. You are asserting that I must be an advocate for decreasing human rights because **you** accept that as a natural consequence of understanding the rights viewpoints more. That simply is demonstrably false.

As I've said I can have the largest red lines, possible to see from space and it doesn't mean I cannot say ""tell me more about why you think the way you do"". I'm sorry that your views are so fragile they need to be protected by of all things, blind ignorance.

If only the right was as stupid as you make them out to be things would be so utterly simple. They aren't though. I need to understand exactly what they mean and why they think it to have a hope of talking authoritatively on the subject to convince moderates. Me becoming a left nutcase talking in equally alienating ridiculous simplistic black and white unrelenting language doesn't serve me as a person, or my viewpoint.

Both of the radical sides are equally cancerous, more for their inability to see anything that doesn't come from their own side than anything else.

Better people than you have been eroded in exactly that same way. It can happen to anyone, and it's already happened to you.

As I said, there is such a thing as too much information.

You're either a part of the problem, or part of the solution. ""Moderate"" stances are simply taking the side of the broken status quo at best and being too cowardly to stand with the hateful right at worst.

 I'm done with this conversation; I wish you the best of luck when Project 2025 eventually comes for you despite you thinking that your ""understanding"" will save you.","lwa0g5o"
