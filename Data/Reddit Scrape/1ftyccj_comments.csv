Most of the time I just read them for the pictures, but as I got older and my imagination grew, I was able to read fairytales without any pictures since I could imagine everything so easily in my head and that made it really fun and interesting. So my advice would be to start with fantasy books with pretty illustrations and go from there :D",""

"lpvfuoy","VengeanceDolphin","2024-10-01 20:52:12 UTC","My dad used to read some books to us in the evenings (the ones I remember were the Redwall series, the Boxcar children series, and heavily redacted Heidi and Wind in the Willows because he got bored of the descriptions lol and would say stuff like, “it was a sunny day” *skips several pages*). I enjoyed this. I also read LOTR in middle school because a family friend, whom I looked up to, was a huge fan. 

Cautionary tale: at about your sister’s age, I started to read chapter books on my own, and my favorites were the baby sitters club, Nancy Drew, and similar series. (There’s even a baby sitters club character who gets in trouble with her parents for reading Nancy Drew! So relatable). My dad was super disappointed that I was reading “trash” even though it was appropriate for my age/ reading level, and I LOVED reading. I just didn’t like reading what he considered good or worthwhile books. 

I read Huck Finn and hated it (I think this was sometime in middle school?), and oh the drama and mood swings he experienced, from elation at the fact that I was reading a Classic to the despair when I pronounced it “boring.” 

I still love reading as an adult and love classics, nonfiction, and pure escapist garbage (tho I won’t say what I consider part of the last category so as not to hurt anyone’s feelings), but it wouldn’t have been surprising if I just stopped reading for fun as a pre teen due to the pressure.",""

I read them to my children and have just started to read them to my grandchildren. Kipling in particular was a poet as much as a writer and his stories have a rhythm that are meant to be read aloud. It may be sound pretentious but I think that the best children's stories have this Homeric quality of recitability.

There are many modern books with similar qualities, Where The Wild Things Are, Hairy McClary, and The Gruffalo. After the fourth or fifth repetition they read with you and start reading on their own.

"lpx380j","Lega2l-Employment-9","2024-10-02 02:47:04 UTC","I am so with you on wanting to share the magic of classic tales! When I was a kid, it was all about the enchantment of being whisked away to a totally different world. My mom had this way of reading stories with these dramatic voices and grand gestures that made everything feel so epic and alive. I swear, I was convinced dragons existed somewhere in the backyard. 

One thing that might work for you is to inject a bit of that theatrical flair into storytime. It’s amazing how some enthusiastic voices and a bit of play-acting can transform ""boring"" stories into unforgettable adventures. And who says you have to stick to reading? You can craft the tales into mini performances. Get some puppets, build a blanket fort as your storytelling realm, and let her be part of the action. Trust me, kids eat that stuff up. If you make her feel like she’s stepping into that adventure with you, you’ll have her hooked on the classics in no time.

Another trick I loved was interactive stories. Instead of just reading a fairy tale, you could pause and ask her what she thinks happens next, or what she’d do if she were in that character’s shoes. It makes her feel like she’s part author, part listener, and gets her imagination firing on all cylinders. A word of caution: be ready for some unexpected plot twists when a kid’s in charge!

Books with stunning illustrations can also do wonders. Find versions of classic tales with beautiful artwork that catches her eye. Sometimes, kids need that visual component to draw them in initially. Bonus points if she loves to draw or color; you can ask her to draw scenes from the story or even create her own version of a tale. 

Lastly, mix in those classic tales with her current favorites. Like a “you pick one, I pick one” kind of deal. That way, it feels like a fair trade-off and less like you’re pushing the old stuff on her. And who knows? Maybe a well-timed fairy godmother or a clever talking animal will have her looking forward to those Grimm classics more than you ever expected.

Maybe try acting out some parts of the story or using funny voices for different characters. You could even ask her what she thinks will happen next, as she already likes reading and it would make her feel involved in the storytelling.

Also, mix in some of the more adventurous fairy tales, the ones with action or surprises, so they don’t feel slow compared to what she’s used to. Start with shorter, exciting stories before jumping into longer ones like Brothers Grimm.",""

You can offer to read with her things you like and want to share with her, and that could be a lovely experience, especially if it’s a bonding thing around bedtime or during a quiet moment in the afternoon or on the weekend. She’d likely learn to look forward to those times with you. 

Don’t try to push your favorites on her, though. She’s six or seven (I’m assuming) - isn’t it enough that she’s learning that reading is fun? She’ll grow out of potty humor. My siblings and parents never tried to push me to read things they thought I should read - they just encouraged me to read, read with me, or read in front of me. Now, I’m in my thirties, still love to read, and have evolved past the Magic Attic and American Girl books (though both still SLAP).",""

Suggest a genre or topic - dragons? princesses? - then cater a list of books from there.  Also, if you read TO her or WITH her, you can act out the voices which tends to help kids stay more engrossed in the book. 

Also, there are several book apps out that you can curate lists based on specific books you have read that she liked. They'll provide a list of books for you that are similar to what she already liked.

My one son never read books as a hobby UNTIL the Hunger Games came out. He's 19 now and actually went out and purchased the most recent book so he could go see the movie when he was done. LOL  My other son is 23 now and wouldn't read anything but comics and Percy Jackson for years. My 25yo daughter was a Divergent and Hunger Games girl.

"lq1qhas","Deleted","2024-10-02 22:11:43 UTC","Reading on her own in 1st grade is fantastic, but the true Brothers Grimm tales are probably going to be pretty dense and antiquated language at this stage in her development. If you can, visit to your local library and find some fairy tale books based on the Grimms' tales, but with beautiful illustrations and adapted to more modern language and sensibilities. Modern adaptations are more accessible, and the illustrations will make the story more immersive and engaging. Offer to read them to/with her to make storytime extra special. This is how my own parents and grandparents introduced me to fairytales, and I still love to read them (as a children's librarian today).

Once you read a bunch of the regular editions, there are the Fantasy quest series that are way longer but extremely enjoyable to read. You will probably have to read those ones with her as it may be difficult for a first grader but it got me interested in fairytales, myths, and legends. It has another similar series called Thea Stilton which is his sister, this is almost as good but if she enjoys girly things she may prefer this one. Also, the Rainbow Magic series may be something she can also like (but this one was a smidge boring for me so try one out and gauge her interest level). Another really good one I forgot to mention earlier is the Magic Treehouse series. Each book is super short but there’s so much exploration the two main characters (siblings) do. Years ago when I was in second grade my teacher would read one book a week from this series. Let me know if you try any of these out! Good luck with your sister’s reading journey :)",""

If she is more contrarian, try the reverse psychology tricks. I wasn't ""allowed"" to stay up late reading, but the book was conveniently always left on my bedside table.

- they were stored next to the books they themselves read, and they would read their own books, indicating that it was an activity they enjoyed and not just something they wanted me to do

- they didn't take away the books I had that were made for kids, leaving then as options
