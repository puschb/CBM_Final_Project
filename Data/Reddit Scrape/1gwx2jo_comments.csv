Someone who needs therapy themselves becoming a therapist is such a well worn cliche and showcasing just how much you're struggling with your own identity and trying to frame all that as the fault of another (while actively arguing that how this person is dealing with their own trauma is the 'wrong way' of doing it) is the kind of thing that should have any future client/patient of his running for the hills.",""

"lydfihk","Dimpleshenk","2024-11-22 05:33:44 UTC","Wow, the whole family drama would be much better worked out in private. It's funny how this Hollywood Reporter article plays out, though, with the revelation more than half-way down that the article's author had previously written about Dave Eggers in an overly intense way that made Dave want to get a restraining order against him. Now I want to know: What is the article author's (Gary Baum's) own beef with Dave Eggers? It starts to seem like Baum himself has a romantic obsession with Dave and is happy to use Toph to bolster his obsession because Toph, too, has a brotherly obsession with Dave. Or something like that -- it's all kinda gross.

I read A Heartbreaking Work (etc. -- what an obnoxious title) when it was released. At first I was caught up in the hype about it and wanted to enjoy it, but after a while you realize the book is spiraling into itself and revealing an empty center. The whole thing about Dave's editorship of the magazine in S.F. (what was it, Might magazine?) and how he tried to get the kid from Eight Is Enough, Adam Rich, to stage his own death, makes you realize that Dave Eggers is willing to whore himself out for fame in a calculated way that gives very little back to the reader. The substance of the book is sorely lacking, and it points to its own shallowness and says ""Look how deep I am for admitting I'm shallow!"" and then expects people to applaud.

Enter Toph Eggers, who was used as the primary subject matter for the book. He is basically the Phoebe in a wannabe ""Catcher in the Rye"" narrative -- the innocent younger sibling, oblivious to the pains of the main character, giving him a focal point for what matters, etc. There are long passages in ""Heartbreaking Work"" about Dave and Toph playing frisbee on the beach, trying to get just the right throw and trajectory, refining their physical prowess in the way of idealized brothers enjoying a pure activity together. The book isn't fictionalized so the Toph in the story is the one in the real world, and he would then grow up people everywhere saying ""I read about you"" and commenting on his young life without him being equipped for this strange kind of mini-celebrity, from which he acquired no actual benefit. 

You sense that Toph himself would have developed into a complex person regardless of the book, but it was an added element that sparked in him a bunch of expectations and desires, such as the idea that if he's like his brother then he must also be talented at writing and creating, so therefore that is what he should do. It must have been confusing, especially with no parental guidance (their parents died of cancer when he was very young) and with Dave Eggers, who made the situation what it was, also a surrogate parent for Toph. How strange to have your brother, role model, and competitive focal point (as brothers tend to be) also your main authority figure, potential source of financial assistance, and a famous person who hobnobs with celebrities and presidents, to an extent that you might then always hope to stay in good graces so they might be able to open doors of opportunity for you.

But with so much riding on his brother's fame etc., Toph obviously became resentful and bitter. You can see that with the two articles he wrote for Salon dot com around 2010-2012. Toph Eggers wrote one piece in particular that was absolutely trashing a screenwriter, Steve Koren, for a string of dumb comedy movies (Bruce Almighty, Click, Night at the Roxbury). That piece was so mean-spirited and ill-advised that Toph asked for Salon to retract it, and they did. Salon's editor (I wish he'd name names on who was behind the decision to publish that) promoted the piece and you sense Salon was desperate to make waves in the manner of now-defunct sites like Gawker or Jezebel, since it was on the decline and probably operating in debt. Back in the 1990s the publishing world and the dot-com boom supported really out-there, snarky, overcritical poses, but it no longer washed in 2012. 

What I was struck by with Toph Eggers's attempt to takedown a screenwriter was that Toph was transfering his resentment toward Dave Eggers onto some other screenwriter. Dave Eggers had recently joined the ranks of the novelists-turned-screenwriters group, writing scripts for such movies as Where the Wild Things Are, and probably raking in even more fame and money while Toph stewed on the sidelines as the fading-from-memory, cute little character in one of big brother's early works. Toph wanted to get some of that Eggers-family attention too, and pulled a stunt in the spirit of his brother, but it backfired badly and revealed a real ugliness of intent that surprised a lot of people who only knew him from the Dave Eggers book. It immediately signaled that there was deep pain in him, and in the whole family.

I think it all reveals how complicated family dynamics are, and the fact that just because people are siblings doesn't mean they're actually like or in sync with each other. The resentments and age differences, plus just widely varying chromosomes (even from the same parents), can make people as different as if they weren't related at all. But they're still connected in all sorts of ways. I think it's pretty wild, though, in this Hollywood Reporter article, that Toph Eggers goes on the record comparing Dave to the Mary Tyler Moore character in ""Ordinary People."" If you haven't seen that movie, the Timothy Hutton character (whom Toph sees himself as) is deeply suicidal, and part of his suicide stems directly from the fact that he has, since his earliest memory, felt that his mother (Moore) didn't love him at all. Then as the movie goes on, it becomes apparent that Moore's character really is just absolutely cold-hearted and incapable of loving her son. Donald Sutherland (the father) ends up laying into her about how horrible and ice-cold she is -- how soulless and cruel. It's not nuanced at all, and for Toph Eggers to cast Dave Eggers in that role is psychologically really damning, for both of them.

I hope Toph Eggers gets help. He seems like somebody who has become a therapist out of the fact that he needs therapy. I hope he keeps getting it. I also worry about the author of the Hollywood Reporter story. He seems to be incredibly misguided. I almost wonder if there is some sort of weird relationship between him and Toph.",""

it also brings to mind christopher robin milne, who a century earlier became a unconsenting character in his father's works and went on to speak out about it as an adult:

> ""For it was now that began that love-hate relationship with my fictional namesake that has continued to this day.""[14] His father's books were popular, and they were well known by his schoolmates, which made Milne a target of bullying by the other children.[15][16] Milne later described the poem ""Vespers"" – about the toddler Christopher Robin saying his evening prayers – as ""the one [work] that has brought me over the years more toe-curling, fist-clenching, lip-biting embarrassment than any other.""

> Milne earned a mathematics scholarship at Stowe School, where he was relentlessly bullied, and wrote: ""It seemed to me almost that my father had got to where he was by climbing upon my infant shoulders, that he had filched from me my good name and had left me with the empty fame of being his son.""

> Milne, who did not want any part of his father's royalties, decided to write a book about his childhood. As Milne describes it, that book, The Enchanted Places, ""combined to lift me from under the shadow of my father and of Christopher Robin, and to my surprise and pleasure I found myself standing beside them in the sunshine able to look them both in the eye"".

Consequently, I'm quite the opposite. The entire piece feels like a family's personal business dragged into the public due to a thirty-year-old work, but with little substantive investigation in it. 

Even venturing into the realm of why a sibling may have killed themselves struck me as particularly tasteless. 

I think the author has an interesting theme, which is that how we process grief is entirely personal, and one person can't define it for a family. There is the secondary issue, as well, of how celebrity affects a family when it benefits one person far more than another. 

Having said that, it comes across somewhat as an attempt to show that Dave Eggers is a dick by exclusion. Without his voice in it at length to give his side (or his older sibling, or his deceased sister) it's so incomplete as to be effectively exploitive.","lycrgiw"
"lyf68w7","SoothingDisarray","2024-11-22 14:44:50 UTC","\\> at least it was his own trauma

I think that's what this article ignores. Yes, Toph had trauma. Yes, Beth had trauma. But, is Dave not allowed to have trauma as well? When you process your trauma publicly you lose some control over it. But it should at least be acknowledged as just as vital and relevant if we're acknowledging the trauma of other people who literally faced the \\_exact same trauma\\_.

I read and loved this book when it came out. I always saw it as a fictionalized memoir and never quite read it for an honest accounting. That things were left out or glossed over or ""hidden in plain sight"" does not surprise me. The book was intentionally and laughingly self-referential and entirely self-mocking (starting from the title itself)  while also self-mythologizing. And I think did an incredibly good job at what it was trying to do. I haven't read it since and I doubt at my current age or the way my tastes in literature have evolved that I would be as moved by the book now. (Even now, though, I still call it literature rather than memoir. I struggle to think of it as memoir.)

So, yes, clearly the book was unfair to Toph, a non-consenting minor, in its use of him as a symbolic subject. And, yes, clearly the book was unfair to Beth in its non-use of her as a non-present figure. (You can't really win with memoir, can you?) But as an art object I think it succeeded.","lyexq2o"

If Beth did an interview and the interviewer asked her ""Did the book accurately reflect how you were involved in raising Toph,"" then Beth is obviously going to say, ""No, the book did not include the fact that I did a lot of Toph's raising."" And then the article is going to come out with the headline, ""Dave Eggers' sister Beth says that her brother's book did not accurately portray how involved she was in raising their younger brother."" And even if you then go on record saying that you aren't bothered by the book (which she did), you've still been forever portrayed as having *complained* about it. But that was just you honestly answering an interviewer's question and not complaining at all.

I'm not saying that's how it went down. But we see this happening all the time, though usually with much lesser stakes. 

(Example: An interviewer asks an author if there are any genres he or she does not like to read. The author--falling for the trap--says, ""Personally, I've never been into mysteries.""

Dave tried to kill this piece, not Toph’s book, because it was being written by someone who has been critical of Dave for decades.

"lyh6gkg","Informal_Fennel_9150","2024-11-22 21:03:45 UTC","He hadn't been 'critical of Dave for decades' he wrote articles about him on a literature blog as a high schooler at a time where Eggers was the star of the scene. Immaturely in many ways, but on the whole just chronicling a famous author's exploits, almost akin to the way people are scholars of Dickens or Achebe. He was on the whole largely admiring of Egger's literary prowess and personable character, and the only purely critical episode was the interview with Beth were she (not Baum) expressed displeasure at her exclusion. 

Also I think Toph has a better stab at understanding of Dave's motivations than you, a stranger on the internet. If Toph recognizes Dave's letter as an attempt to influence the narrative or discourage it altogether, that is based on his experiences with his brother and past patterns of behaviour. That is far more information than you have.","lyfwau3"

"lyg6xkz","SoothingDisarray","2024-11-22 17:57:27 UTC","Yeah I get what you are saying. I think that makes sense. I'm not really sure I believe that Dave was being so oppressively influential over Toph's memoir (unless I missed something, the only evidence of that is Dave sent Toph one letter and then Toph cut off contact) but I think it's still legitimate to say (a) Dave has already had his day and (b) Toph is allowed his turn. 

But: the thing about Dave getting his say is that it wasn't because he went first, it's because he wrote an amazing book! (Or at least what many considered to be an amazing book.) Just because Toph shares the same life story doesn't mean he is going to be able to write a great book about it. For all we know (and, frankly this is a much more likely explanation) the reason Toph never finished writing his own memoir is not because he felt like Dave was influencing him but, rather, it wasn't as good. 

Not everyone who experiences trauma writes a brilliant memoir about it. It's likely Toph only had an opportunity to write one _because_ his older brother had already written a best-selling critically acclaimed memoir. Otherwise no one would have sought out Toph for the project. 

I agree that this is all difficult and sucks for a lot of people and is pretty sad for a family already the victim of multiple traumas to be torn apart over this. 

I also think that sometimes art triumphs over internecine squabbles. Art justifies itself. It's hard for me to say that Dave Eggers should not have written a generation and genre defining memoir just because his brother might later be upset with it _even though I agree with his brother._

(I'm exaggerating a bit calling it generation and genre defining, but I think there's no denying it's importance in the memoir and literary canon from that era.)","lyg0aa2"

"lyg860j","SoothingDisarray","2024-11-22 18:03:44 UTC","Also I think it's a little weird how the article keeps blaming Toph's need for therapy on the memoir. Maybe Toph needs therapy because both his parents died within a week of each other when he was just a kid and he was then raised by his older siblings who were still practically kids themselves. Like, you know, the thing the memoir was about.

I'm not saying the memoir _helped_, but, like, the death of the parents is the _actual_ trauma they are all dealing with in that family. Plus, to imply that Beth's suicide was in any way influenced by the memoir is truly cruel. (The article explicitly says no one thinks that, but then again the article is really winking about it.)","lyg6xkz"

I believe responsible journalism should include weighing the worth, purpose, and potential collateral damage of reporting. Without a full picture of their family dynamic -- which isn't just Toph and David Eggers, and includes people who can't and won't talk to them -- it simply seems like poor journalism, void of any significant purpose other than satisfying people's morbid curiosity.","lyid6c4"
"lyih35i","TeddyBridgecollapse","2024-11-23 01:41:24 UTC","Yeah, and the journalist gave a watered down reason as to why: he's previously published shitty articles about Eggers, and accordingly Eggers didn't want to deal with this guy.

"lyj8suw","kbb824","2024-11-23 04:58:48 UTC","Yeah. That’s kind of my point. I’m responding to someone who implied we should believe Dave is the person Toph says he is. I’m basically saying I disagree, because this is only one side of the story.

And even this side of the story doesn’t always seem bad for Dave. For example, he wrote Toph a letter when Toph was working on a memoir, and the one detail we get of the letter is that Dave loved their sister’s sense of humor. Maybe Toph’s right and that was Dave being manipulative, or maybe Dave was just writing his brother a letter. What I’m saying is, all we know is Toph *thinks* that letter was Dave being manipulative.","lyiw1vd"
