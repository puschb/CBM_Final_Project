But people often forget or misunderstand the civil, which isn’t necessarily about pre-established statues and rules that apply to everyone (Common Law) but is about claims made against others who have infringed upon you in a specific way that isn’t or cannot be covered in Common Law.

Contracts exist partly to make the decision-making process in civil law easier. If I say you agreed to repay a loan and I have a counter-signed contract saying exactly this, then I can take you a small claims court and you’ll have to prove you’ve repaid it. If you can’t, the decision will invariably go my way and you may have to pay additional damages to a reasonable degree.

Contracts, agreements, disclaimers are not “the law”. That would make the world impossible to navigate, since you could just declare laws whenever you want; it’s not practical. Even contracts that have been agreed by both parties can in some cases be unenforceable if the terms therein are excessively punitive, onerous or unfair to one party.

Copyright law works similarly. I work in music, not literature, so I can only speak to how it works there but the bottom line is that the writer of a given composition owns the rights to it unless they decide to transfer them. This means that they can sue someone who uses that composition without asking but because it’s civil law, I have to choose to take action. The person who used my composition isn’t “breaking the law” and they’re not a criminal, but if I exercise my rights I can stop them using it or demand compensation.

In the case of a book publisher, I think it reasonably works in a similar way. By stating they they do not wish for their intellectual property to be used to train AI models, they are signalling an intention to sue anyone who ignores this declaration. The extent to which this can actually be identified and proven is a very fair question, and I don’t know how one would go about doing so.","lsqd00j"

The things AI is mostly being successfully used for are menial tasks like summarizing large quantities of text or generating stock imagery. It is very likely, that very soon, creative industries like animation that are infamous for ""crunch"" culture due to how much menial labor is involved will benefit greatly from artists capable of using AI to automate away large parts of the work. And yes, this will ""replace"" creative workers, because those creative workers were actually just underpaid cubicle slaves.

Remember Reddit darling Joel Haver? He used [style transfer software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq_KOmXyVDo), a form of generative AI, to create his videos, and it allowed him to create incredibly low-cost animation as a solo artist, something that would not have been possible before. This is where we will see AI become useful.

Just because every company under the sun is pushing their new ""AI"" feature because getting in on tech buzzwords makes investors happy does not mean AI as a whole is bad.

Corporate greed and abuse is a separate issue, and not limited to AI.  
      
It absolutely is necessary for the AI to have creative understanding.  
You need to think about what this means on a functional level, not an ideological or selfish level. The tools being developed and used right now are the stepping stones to greater, more elaborate, and more capable systems.  
    
All of human creativity and capacity for art is a byproduct of other evolutionary functions: recognize danger and avoid danger, do risk analysis, recognize the unknown and potentially investigate the unknown, understand other people and animals and communicate with  them, navigate society, predict the future based on current circumstances and planned actions.    
You cannot separate the creative and functional aspects of human cognition, they are the same thing being used in different ways.   
    
We need the AI to have a semantic understanding of the world, visually and linguistically, and logically. Being able to classify and generate arbitrary images and concepts seems to be a two way street. It's very, very difficult and prohibitively time consuming to try and manually train on individual concepts, and program for individual circumstances, and you always miss stuff.     
     
We *need* an AI which has some level of conscious mind, which can deal with ambiguity, which can think and project into the future. We *need* the AI to work out for itself that if it does thing X, then thing Y will happen, so that it can avoid taking actions which are usually good but are circumstantially bad. To do that, it needs generative ability. Working out how to achieve goals and avoid disaster literally involves telling logical stories to yourself.    
    
Trying to jump past billions of years of evolution is also expensive. Today's LLMs the LVMs, and whatever else cost millions of dollars to create. We need to get some kind of return on investment while we develop these tools.  
A housemaid robot is going to cost more than a car. Are you going to invest in a $200k robot today, which can't actually do the job today, based on the hope that it might become able within 10 years? I already know that it's statistically likely that you can't afford that, but you can afford a few dollars for ChatGPT API access which is running on hardware shared by millions of other people.  
     
I think what the most socially interesting part of this is, is that various so-called ""unskilled labor"" are turning out to be some of the most difficult problems to solve, and it turns some of the social hierarchy on its head. The people who can do manual labor are the hardest to replace, and the people pushing papers and drawing pictures are the first in danger.    
Why aren't you people crying over all the dishwashers and other jobs manual labor robots would displace? It's because you think it would benefit you without negatively impacting you.     
If it was ""low skill"" workers being threatened first, would you still have objections, or would you say something to the effect of "" I got mine, those other people should have made better life decisions""?    
     
Talking about robots replacing human creativity is just disguised selfishness.  
Everyone was on board with AI robots until they were being personally affected.   
People need to stop complaining about ""AI"" and start looking at the real problem, which is the effectively plutocratic capitalist social structure.","lssxbzl"

I'd probably still value it less than animation that didn't involve ai. But I don't know that it'd be much different for me than how I value hand-drawn and inked animation over digital animation.

I sincerely doubt that, given how difficult it can be to quantify even ""unemployment"", but regardless, we're talking about big pushes with new technologies across multiple sectors at once in a corporate culture that would rather pursue a fantasy of infinite revenue for no monetary investment than actually better the society it exists in. You don't need a ton of historical data to see the issues here.

Just this morning I saw a post suggesting that as AI replaces script writers that the scriptwriters could go into other film disciplines, like storyboarding. Well, the storyboarding sector already has too many people fighting over too few jobs, and there are studios even now trying to do away with storyboard artists because ""AI can do it fine."" Maybe they can all go into acting? No, wait, same problems there.

"lswgsf6","Johnny_B_GOODBOI","2024-10-20 20:45:14 UTC","That doesn't save energy. The dishwasher only uses a few gallons per cycle, heating up this smaller amount of water takes less energy than heating up a whole standard hot water tank. Plus running the hot water tap draws hot water through all the pipes between the tank and the sink/dishwasher, heating those up and wasting energy.","lsu62p8"

"lt3s8em","use_knowledge","2024-10-22 01:31:27 UTC","If your dishwasher only uses a few gallons, why would you have to heat up a whole standard hot water tank? That seems a bit overkill and if that's how things worked, it'd take HOURS to ever get hot water. Mine tends to stay hot so it's available when needed.

Running the hot water tap only draws water in a direct path through the pipe from the tank to the tap, the water in any pipes that branch off from this line will not move since the system is under pressure - technically, a little bit will swirl and mix but that's negligible. Try it sometime, run your kitchen sink tap until it's hot, then check if the bathroom faucet is immediately hot. It won't be.

It doesn't make sense to heat additional cold water when you've got a tank of it sitting in your water heater on standby.

I see nothing that would suggest this suit would have a different outcome. *Hacking* gpt to produce copyrighted data like in your other example, and therefore going against terms of service, is not a valid example of gpt producing copyrighted content. That's like me suing HP because someone used their printer to print copyrighted content lmao.","lsqrbh4"

A different suit getting dismissed doesn't prove anything about the nyt. If you have an argument for why the one suit implies somethng spesific about the other, I would love to hear it. Right now you are not comparing anything about the two cases. ","lsqsfyk"
