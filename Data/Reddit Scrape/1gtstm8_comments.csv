This dreamlike quality is important in this twist because if the author creates something so obviously tangible and snatches it away, it'll leave readers throwing hands. Whereas with this dreamlike imagery and diction, readers kind of get the hint that it was a dream, or at least they're not as surprised at the end of the book.

The ""it was all a dream"" trope could actually work in this case since you can actually trace things back to the moment where the character had hit the wall. Same can be said for a car crash.

Now, whether the person said that it was an instance where the trope actually works or not is something I cannot remember right now 😅 What I have summed up is that the trope seems to have a better chance of working out if the author is exploring psychology rather than fantasy. If the author spends x number of books writing an amazing fantasy world with incredible characters, then any kind of statement along the lines of ""the main character was dreaming all of it"" is something that just feels like a cop-out on the author's part. After all, we know the world in the fantasy series isn't real, but why does it have to be fantasy for the main character, too? **That** seems to be the crux of the trope.","lxz7qqa"

I mean, seven books is way too long to fall in love with the characters and the world only to have it be fantasy even to the main character!

As for stand-alone books, the ones that particularly explore psychology seem to be the ones that at least stand a chance of pulling off the trope (basing this off of comments I've being seeing on this post the past couple of days). While I cannot think of a book I've read that does this, I can definitely think of movies that do this, and it's worked out relatively well.

That being said, I always liked how the characters would sometimes question if everything was real, but there is too much in the series to indicate that Narnia is real in the series. Now, if anything, I see Narnia as one of those instances where the "">!they all die in the end!<"" kind of trope actually works out since it's a very hopeful and positive outlook on what comes next (I am also in the camp that thinks that people still misunderstand Susan's ending, but that's a completely different discussion).","ly3byh3"

>!the doctor is sick by Anthony Burgess!< - actually more like psychosis than just a dream.   it works imo, possibly because there's no ""totally different fantasy reality"" disjunction. the character carries his waking self into his delirium, and the reality of his delirium might as well be the reality of, um, reality.  it's very much like the kind of dream where everything is hyperreal, you flail along trying to achieve something urgent or worrying, and you get nowhere because things just keep slipping past or away from you.  when he ""returns"" it's not as if either conflict gets resolved by him just ""waking up"".  readers may not like the book but there was nothing lazy or cliche about Burgess writing it.  


>!ludo and the star horse by mary stewart!<   this is a children's / YA book; arguably more of an allegory than a dream.   at 13 or so and probably over a thousand children's books read by that point, maybe I should have anticipated the resolution.  but I'm here to attest I did not.  


>!the hothouse on the East River by Muriel Spark!<  okay, this one did piss me off, but not really because I had a problem with the device or its reveal.   it was just spark at her most elliptical and post-modern.   note though that I don't mind letting Muriel Spark piss me off 😋.  it's all for the good of the cause in her case. ","lxp57pr"

It's hard to say in some of the stories. Dick has great ideas but it's not 100% across the board; his dialog and character development is somewhat one dimensional.

Edit: I really don't want to recommend specific titles but his books are well worth reading. 

Not all are delusions of reality. Books like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep explores empathy and what makes people people. 

You'll also find a lot of odd religions in his books too.

Ex: In Maze of Death gods can be prayed to and you'll get answers. They sometimes intercede and save you before something goes wrong. One of the characters prays to be sent to a new colony and one of the gods grants his request. When he gets there people start being dying one by one and no one knows what's going on. 

Some of his books are less than serious. One his funnier books is Galactic Pot-Healer. That one involves a demi-god that hires the main character(and a lot of others) to raise a sunken cathedral on Sirius 6/Plowman's Planet and the 'antagonist' is a book that tells the future.","lxss454"
