they suggest that the owners, the ultra wealthy, the vip's, movers amd shakers of this world are people like you&me, and struggle just like you&me.

the fuck they are of course, but the stories must be told so the plebs don't feel too inadequate. a little bit like trash is fine, stay in your lane underling. but too much and they'll either revolt or off themselves, which will mean they'll stop working.
