"lty3gqi","Interesting_Chart30","2024-10-27 01:58:08 UTC","The books were written in different time periods and under vastly different circumstances.  Jane Austen was far more worldly than the Brontës .  She was popular among her family and friends; loved fashion, dancing, and satire. With a few exceptions, her male characters aren't jerks.  The Brontës had sad, depressing lives, and this shows in their work.  The male characters are awful human beings.  Rochester and Heathcliff are both manipulative and narcissistic. I loved ""Jane Eyre"" as a teenager, but I have no idea what she sees in Rochester.  There is no sense of joy or laughter in any of their writings.  Death and madness are constantly on the minds of everyone. Give me Emma, Elizabeth, Anne, Marianne, Elinor, and Catherine, and their male friends any day!",""

The two sets of authors have an entirely different flavour. Jane Austen died when the eldest Brontë sister was 1. Her books are classic regency, the Brontë sisters firmly Victorian. Different social scene. ",""
"ltxj7pe","TaliesinMerlin","2024-10-26 23:47:12 UTC","I love both Charlotte Bronte and Jane Austen. I read Pride and Prejudice first and liked it as a sharp window into courtship in the middle class in the time period - insightful and witty with heart. Then I read Jane Eyre, which, yes, there are some similarities: female protagonist, love story, an almost unsympathetic male love interest. But the atmosphere of the text is much more isolated. Instead of dances and a well-to-do family, Jane Eyre is an orphan turned governess who works. Instead of a love interest whose dark secret is being more kind behind his pride, Rochester has a wife in his attic. They are telling different stories; I like them both. 

Other tidbits: 

* My favorite Austen novel is *Persuasion*. 
* The Austen novel I'd say is most like Jane Eyre is *Northanger Abbey*. It's raw, more explicitly gothic, and a lot of fun.
* I respect *Wuthering Heights*, but I don't like it nearly as much.",""
"ltyvjfi","Sleep_and_Poetry","2024-10-27 05:35:45 UTC","It’s not really a divide at all, most classic literature lovers tend to like them both, but I have seen shades of what you’re referring to in lit social media circles, where (often younger) fans will at times call themselves ‘Austen girls’ and ‘Brontë girls’. Jane Austen’s books tend to have a drier wit and more satirical edge, and take place largely within the conventional structures of upper class society at the time, with more ‘believable’ plot events. 

The Brontes (at least, if you base their perception off Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights) tend to have more of a flair for the grandiose, with heightened emotion and dramatic events. Charlotte Brontë generally disliked Jane Austen’s work, finding it overly manicured and dull. I do find that Austen’s work reminds me of a well cultivated and organized garden a la Versailles, whereas the Brontes’ work remind me more of a mysterious, dark and lush forest.

I like them both, but gun to my head, I’m going with the Brontes.",""

"ltywq0y","cozycinnamonhouse","2024-10-27 05:47:32 UTC","Lit nerd / English teacher here:

Here's the thing: The Brontë sisters are deeply unhinged in ways that Jane Austen simply cannot match. Jane Austen is a subtle feminist and critic of patriarchy in ways that are far ahead of her time and hilarious in particular ways (usually satire and social commentary) that the Brontë sisters cannot match. I adore both, but for totally different reasons.

Wuthering Heights is probably the most unhinged book I have ever read (side note: if you find yourself relating too much to Wuthering Heights, break up with whoever you're dating for the love of all things holy) while Jane Eyre is unhinged enough to keep things interesting, but definitely not on the level of Wuthering Heights.

Jane Austen is not unhinged in this sense --- she is portraying much more realistic portrayals of the life of women of her social class at her time. I love her for the fact that she is centering women and telling us about what women do and think. One of my friends in college pointed out that Jane Austen novels do not pass the reverse Bechdel test, and I love them for that. Jane Austen can be unhinged in her own way, but it's very subtle compared to the Brontë sisters --- it often looks like her sneaking some scathing commentary on society (especially patriarchy) into an otherwise demure story.

I think the Brontë sisters (specifically Charlotte and Emily) can be easier to get into simply because they are so unhinged and because Jane Austen is the OG slow burn writer and can be boring for people who are not invested or don't understand the context of why her work is so important.  On the other hand, I think sometimes people who enjoy order and do not suffer from mental illness prefer Jane Austen because the Brontë sisters are so outrageously unhinged.

This is anecdotal and also a generalization, but I have also noticed and that men and other masculine people tend to enjoy the Brontë sisters more, and my personal hypothesis is that because it's easier to be interested in CRAZY women than in regular women doing regular feminine stuff. We have this horrible societal attitude that it's unmanly for men to care about what women do and it pervades literature in an awful way.

If you're literature nerd enough to learn about and appreciate the context of the work, I think you're likely to enjoy both, because they're both important and groundbreaking in the literary canon. Which is to say, this division is probably more amongst casual readers than amongst serious fans of literature.

TL;DR: Both are great. This division is probably more amongst casual readers than serious fans of literature.

  
Edit to add: Personally I found Anne Brontë kind of boring and felt like there is a reason she is the least famous Brontë sister after reading Agnes Grey. If anybody wants to enlighten me on what's enjoyable about Anne Bronte specifically, I would love to hear it.",""

Austen highlights the plight of women. They are predominantly victims, stuck in the roles society provides for them with limited amounts of choice. 

The Brontës show women as having full agency of their lives. Take Jane Ayre, ‘I am no bird and no net ensnares me’. Independent women, who may suffer for their choices but make them anyway. 

Those are two very different viewpoints! At the time, Austen and the Brontë sisters struggled to understand each other and I think it makes sense that their biggest fans would struggle too.

The Brontes are very popular but not in the same way.  For one thing it would be tough to throw a Bronte party, and they don't fit with light-hearted, or being fun.  Their characters tend to be isolated and moody, but not in a way you can play with like Poe.  

I think at the very bottom of it all, when you read Austen you leave with the idea of ""what silly fools people can be!"" With the Brontes it's ""what monsters WE can be.""",""
"lu9n25p","Wise-Vegetable1866","2024-10-29 00:07:40 UTC","I read ""Pride and Prejudice"" and I can see how some have this undying love for it. Personally, I found it exhausting and unenjoyable. I found one or two of the sisters and especially the mother to be annoying to the point that I wanted to slap them. I felt like the father in that book and was happy when I finished it because I didn't have to endure it anymore. Perhaps I didn't read it right when I read it.

"lucra04","Thumbs_of_Green","2024-10-29 14:30:26 UTC","They have very different pulse rates. With Austen, most of what is really being said is through presupposition. The narratives reach beyond the story that is directly being told. You have a smirk tugging at your lips the whole time, like she's your sharp, cutting - sometimes incredibly unforgiving - friend who drips hard gossip in your ear during bad family functions while forcing you to keep a straight face. Everything is measured and controlled, all action feels deliberate, if you take your eyes off the road for a glancing second you'll miss a good burn. She's the delicate hand touch on the thigh; the Bronte's are a hard slap to all four cheeks.

Charlotte, a vibrant controlled explosion; Emily a manic fire; Ann a simmering flame that eats through the underside of your house before collapsing the walls. They demand you keep pace with them, Charlotte and Ann with measure, Emily always at full gallop. Listen to this, don't walk away, there's a ghost in your head and it wants to eat you up, let me lick it first, let me lead you into the dark muddy slick of the moors where other voices start to sound and the fog appears like witch-mist. 

If you put Jane Eyre's caged bird monologue with Rochester and transplanted it to Darcy, he would rattle apart against her energy. Catherine Earnshaw at the Box Hill picnic, drop kicking Emma for being snide. Adele wandering around Northanger Abbey, confused as to why there isn't actually a woman imprisoned in the attic. 

Personally, I go back and comfort read Jane Eyre and a selection of Austen throughout the year whenever I feel like I'm losing the ability to like people. Would highly recommend you attempt Wuthering Heights when you're in a solid headspace or listen to the Juliet Stevenson audiobook recording - she also does Pride and Prejudice.

And they still hold up pretty well even if you remove all the regency manners and society. 

The Bronte sisters wrote books that are best read in a very specific frame of mind (at least for me, as far as Wuthering Heights is concerned), but they are still incredible works of fiction. And come on, who doesn't love a broody, angst-filled man every now and then? They are a dash too melodramatic... but hey, specific frame of mind.

You can't read one and expect the other to be a carbon copy. All these authors had their own way of looking at life and approach to writing. They had things they wanted to address.

Tenant of Wildfell Hall illustrates what happens when the young woman chooses a husband poorly and ends up with a womanizing, misogynistic drunk. There's feminist aspects to both - particularly the Tenant of Wildfell Hall - that I appreciated, but they aren't as memorable as her sisters' books I suppose. That said, I liked Tenant of Wildfell Hall quite a bit.","ltywq0y"
"lu3j7om","Feeling_Laugh5152","2024-10-28 00:05:35 UTC","Great response! I agree with your perspective, even with the comment about Anne. I recently read Agnes Grey and found it utterly forgettable. It's not a bad story, but it's not one that I will remember. I read it a couple of weeks ago, and I have to make an effort to even remember it now! I found The Tenant of Wildfell Hall in a second-hand bookshop recently and I have heard good things about it, so hopefully it will reconcile me with Anne Brontë.

In terms of the divide between Austen and the Brontë sisters, I love Jane Eyre but Wuthering Heights is too unhinged for me. On the other hand, the deeply feminine perspective and dry wit of Jane Austen speak to my soul in a way that no other author has ever matched.","ltywq0y"

Yep Heathcliff, the mixed race mongrel from the streets of a port city where slave ships were still illegally in and out irl, where the resident population irl was freed slaves, a few Chinese and south Asian traders, and sailors’ cast off half breeds, barely out of his teens, full of all the rage and longing and hurt of a battered child, self destructive with PTSD, is a cheerful 30 yr old, extremely white looking Australian with iPhone face. 

And Cathy, 18, fragile, moody, defiant, cameo beautiful, whose intense suffocated emotion blows up her life because she loves and wants an authentic life with the wrong person, her probably half-brother, is 35 yr old Barbie, with the most iPhone unconventionally attractive face imaginable.

In my 20s I read _Pride and Prejudice_ - which I adored, and _Wuthering Heights_ - which I disliked. Funny how that works. The post question is if we are divided between Austen and Brontë. But I'm only divided on Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights! 😂","lty7pbu"
