"lxnw0w1","flimflam_machine","2024-11-17 22:29:40 UTC","Presumably ""auguring"", which isn't an extant word AFAIK, but would be derived from:


augur
/ô′gər/


noun
One of a group of ancient Roman religious officials who foretold events by observing and interpreting signs and omens.
A seer or prophet; a soothsayer.


intransitive verb
To predict, especially from signs or omens; foretell. synonym: foretell


I'm guessing ""reccyin'"" is based on ""recce"" which is a a shortened noun or verb form of:


reconnoitre


verb
To perform a reconnaissance (of an area; an enemy position); to scout with the aim of gaining information.
To recognise.
Explore, often with the goal of finding something or somebody.

What I love most about Riddley Walker is that everything is spelled the way it's pronounced.

Cloud Atlas I heard was but while stories overlapped, i could never get into it. None of the characters, none of the stories, I found it all so uninteresting. 

I don't mean to say it was the worst book i ever read, just the worst I made myself finish. I read it waiting for it to get better and live up to the hype. But i found myself wishing it would just end and it never did, it just kept going. I wish i had just quit.

Also I am a huge Haruki Murakami fan, and I think the book deliberately invoked a Murakami atmosphere many times, which also just kind of scratched an itch.

But also, I mean…  what’s not to love?  The Scope!  The Prose!!  The Yakuza!   The Girl With The Beautiful Neck!  The Ending!  The Vengeful Gods!  Goatwriter!  

Sure, give it another go.  I read it like three times, and noticed something new each time.  It’s a very layered book, while also being very fun, and a real page turner.   His stylistic jumps felt like a greatly talented young author stretching his wings, while also being firmly grounded in the book.  I really loved it - it’s a top 5 desert island book for me, I’d choose it over the rest.","lxqrdl7"
