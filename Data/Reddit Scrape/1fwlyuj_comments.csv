"lqhwpjm","LordCouchCat","2024-10-05 18:45:37 UTC","Three points here. Firstly,  different countries have different approaches to church and state. The American form of secularism has advantages but is only one option.  I mention  this because many Americans are under a misapprehension that their form of secularism  is te only democratic option.  It may be the best, that's a possible  case. Many European states have teaching of religion, in some forms, in schools. In England there is religious education which is theoretically Christian but in practice tends to be more education about religion, I believe (English contributors may correct me). France has a sort of secularism that more hostile than neutral. Etc etc. Most of Europe is less religious than the US, despite (or conceivavbly because of) this

Secondly, I think the idea of ""teaching the Bible"" is rather unclear. The Bible is not really *a book* but a collection of texts, of different types, made over thousands of years in very different societies. Example. Early on, there was a belief that if you're good it's rewarded in this life. After a while this is challenged (Job) - how come the good suffer? Later still (and not clearly in the Protestant canon of the OT) the idea that justice after death could explain it. The Bible  contains the rules of an ancient pastoral society, a book of hymns, wisdom literature (a genre popular in the region at  the time), historical books, books of prophetic utterance, (which is less about predictions than denunciation of the rich, etc), some edifying fiction (Jonah, Esther, Judith) etc etc. Unless you understand this, your interpretation will make little sense (the classic fundamentalist problem)Some knowledge of the Bible is really essential to having an educated understanding of western culture: whether you like it or not, it's an important cultural influence. 

Thirdly, teaching about religion is surely a sensible thing since it's part of history and the world, but teaching *about* religion is religious studies, a secular subject.  You learn about Christianity,  Islam, Buddhism,  indigenous religions, whatever. In learning about Christianity, you need to know about the Bible but it isn't sufficient  - you need to know about the history of the church,  the reformation, etc. ""Teaching the Bible"" as a way of studying Christianity would be like teaching the American Constitution as a way of studying American history   - essential knowledge but not sufficient.",""

The only Early-America historical document to actually contain the phrase ""separation of church and state"" was a letter from Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association. https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html

The reason he wrote the letter was to assure them that their freedom of religion would be guaranteed and there would be no ""state church"" that would try to muscle them out or boss them around. And why were they afraid of a state church? Because every state church in Europe had basically done the same thing. None of them were very friendly to local independent churches. If you're a member of a local independent church or part of a church denomination that isn't a clear and decisive majority, you should be as much in favor of separation of church and state as anyone. And even if you think your church is a clear and decisive majority (although depending on how you define ""church"" and ""denomination"", I'd argue that no church in America can truly grab this title), you should still be careful about letting the government into it.","lqgxh7o"

It's also worth noting that he was very careful to judge everyone based on the content of the character, not their political affiliation. One of his disciples was a zealot which probably meant he was a very radical political revolutionary (anti-Roman occupation). At the same time, Jesus praised several gentiles and even Romans for having greater faith than his fellow Jews, on the individual level.

This is absolutely true; a lot of people don't understand how complex the Bible is, or how there are massive intellectual treatises written on topics that are extremely specific which they've never thought or cared about. There are a lot of different ways to examine and interpret the Bible, especially when you focus on exegesis and systematic theology (topics which I am extremely knowledgeable on).

A lot of conservative Christians will not agree with a factual interpretation of the Bible where you look at historicity, cultural context, exact language, and both surrounding and relevant passages. Especially when there often isn't a single, clear cut answer -- we're looking at a series of texts written sometimes thousands of years apart, in different languages and by people of different cultural backgrounds. Even the concept of what God *is* in Judaism evolves over time (in Genesis, he's someone you can wrestle, FFS).

How many Christians have intentionally read in-depth examinations of topics like eschatology (of which there are many views that don't involve the rapture, for example), pneumatology (what is the Holy Spirit and how does it fit in with the rest of the Godhead?), or even shit like philosophical or historical theology? How many of them really grasp the nuances and deep intellectual questions that are involved in studying the Bible? The people who want schools to teach this do not understand that you could spend your whole life studying a tiny subtopic of pneumatology that they wouldn't even see as significant. 

It's an enormously complex field that is *not* clear cut. And most of the time, it doesn't need to be! But when you have educated experts teaching kids, which is the whole concept of teachers in the first place, then they're gonna have a lot of opinions that you're gonna think are unreasonable or ridiculous. And they probably aren't always going to fit with whatever doctrine you or your church believe in -- not to mention how many of your pastors, preachers and priests probably diverge from the official status quo on a great deal of topics. 

I'd be happy to talk to high school students about postmillenialist and preterist eschatology, if I were a teacher, but these kids' parents would have a stroke the second I began discussing why the antichrist doesn't have to be a person and there doesn't need to be a literal apocalypse scenario for Revelations to come true.

The corruption of state and religion is something that history seems to bear out on multiple occasions, so it's generally true. However Jesus was pretty careful not to put any political boundaries on his message, and that includes the fact that he didn't tell people to avoid political activity as individuals. His point was moreso that someone should not find their *ultimate hope* in anything political.

One can reasonably deduce from his approach, that state and religion are two separate ""kingdoms"" and do not share the same fundamental principles.

Regardless of their apologetics towards religion, they do not use religious methods in their moral arguments. They do not appeal to faith. They appeal to reason, and often used faith to elaborate or relate to the dogma of the time. They do not appeal to the supernatural as a basis for their points. They appeal to reason. They use secular logic and reason to make their moral arguments. That is the difference. You can eliminate all references to religion from enlightenment philosophy and the main points remain unchanged. 

The most obvious explanation for the enlightenment philosophers’ religiosity is that they needed to believe in religion or they would be social outcasts. The church were the gate keepers of science. If you didn’t agree with the church you wouldn’t be read, accepted, or known. Or much worse would happen to you. 

It pains me that the logic of Plato seems alien to you because the exact opposite was the case for me. Reading Plato after a childhood of religious indoctrination literally saved my life. Religion doesn’t make any sense at all. It causes endless confusion and perpetuates stupidity. Reading Plato and other secular philosophers taught me that reason and rationality have existed for just as long as religion and that I didn’t need religion at all in order to understand morality, ethics, and how to live a good life. In fact, morality makes MUCH more sense without religion. 

Plato is not without faults but his underlying method is rational in a way that religion NEVER is.

You shouldn't use words like ""tautology"" when you don't know what they mean. Or rather, when you seem to know the *structure* of what they mean, but don't understand how to correctly apply them. 

A true tautology is when a premise-conclusion argument is invalidated by the fact that the conclusion is something that must be true *a priori* in order for the premise to exist at all. In other words, you are pretending to follow the rules of logic, but really you're just tricking the audience by reaching a ""conclusion"" that is a *precursor* to the premise and cannot help but be true. 

In this case, you're suggesting that ANY belief in ANY god presupposes the lack of need for political action. Causing my premise (belief in Jehovah) to only exist with the presupposition that I claimed to be my conclusion (belief in Jehovah does not require political action). 

Unfortunately, your suggestion (ANY belief in ANY god presupposes a lack of need for political action) is blatantly false. Centuries of history tell us that some beliefs in some gods contain the requirement to perform certain political actions. 

And it only takes one example to prove you wrong, so I'll give you one: the American Religious Right. Do you think that they consider political support of the pro-life movement as a requirement? Or simply optional?

And for a fun freebie, I'll give you a second: the Maccabees.

How about a third and fourth? The existence of jihads and crusades?

Therefore, since it's very easy to establish that *some* beliefs in *some* gods (or various forms of them or their doctrine) require political actions as tests of faith or salvation or belonging, it follows that my argument cannot be a tautology. Because the lack of need for political action is not a necessary presupposition for belief in god.

>Once again, not a teaching of separation of church and state.

Never said it was. Jesus didn't demand a separation of church and state, any more than Paul demanded a separation of a marriage with a believer and non-believer under the same roof.

>My table and my chair are separate things. Me pointing this out is not the same as saying they cannot coexist.

You're not wrong because I'm better than you at reading the Bible. You're wrong because you're trying to make logical criticisms that outstrip your depth of understanding of how tautologies and analogies work.

At least, that is my charitable interpretation. Another less charitable would be that you have no concept whatsoever of St. Augustine's two kingdoms (of heaven, and of man) so you don't understand why Jesus is logically allowed to say that citizenship in His Kingdom supersedes all other citizenships.

>And you seem to advocating for some sort of anarchism by claiming any government at all existing makes you abandon god,

So comparative theology was simply a review of various world religions that have achieved prominence throughout history; none were given any particular weight or preference because that would defeat the stated goals of the very curriculum. It wasn't a supermarket where we were intended to decide which religion we liked best, and the aim was never to determine Which Religion Gets It Right.

No, it’s more like “don’t steal,” “love your neighbor,” and that whole Sermon on the Mount bit. Caring for the poor? Yeah, that wasn’t a Greek strong suit. Greeks were more like, “You're poor? Well, sucks to be you.” Jesus, on the other hand, made pitying the poor *cool*.

And holidays? Western culture is basically the Christian calendar with bonus shopping days. Christmas, Easter—none of that’s from Plato’s playbook. You think charity and goodwill come from the Parthenon? Meanwhile, Greek gods were busy turning people into animals and hooking up with mortals. Great for stories, not exactly a moral guide.

Our institutions? Also Christian-rooted. The church was Europe’s first university system, and they held onto that monopoly for centuries. Even democracy as we know it?

The best I have read is that as opposed to a physical manifestation of God (like the wrestling match in Genesis), Moses was struck by illness on his way home. Perhaps a little too much burning bush fumes? (Note many consider the bush to be possibly an allegory for a psychedelic experience)

So anyways ""the Lord let him alone"" after his wife circumcised his son. We all know the Jews take circumcision pretty seriously and so does the OT. Some readers figure that as Moses was raised as an Egyptian, he may not have been circumcised himself, thus angering God.

That really only opens the question about the omniscience of OT God, though. How does he only notice this apparently significant issue after already choosing Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt?

The simplest answer though is in the translation footnote in my annotated NIV Bible, that the Hebrew ""him"" could possibly have referred to Moses' son instead. That would make a lot more sense, but there's no way to truly know.

The name is similar in the Romance languages. In Italian, Sunday is called domenica, which also means “Lord’s Day” (from Latin Dies Dominica). One finds similar cognates in French, where the name is dimanche, as well as Romanian duminică, and in Spanish and Portuguese, domingo.

Not who you were talking to but your conversation made me curious. In English, we get our days named from planetary sources. But in other languages, such as Greek or Italian, days like Sunday are directly connected with Christianity but it seems like only the weekend days have Christian roots in naming. However, there are languages that keep to numbering as a way to avoid pagan naming that also has roots in the creation story.

> In some cases, the “ecclesiastical” names are used, a tradition of numbering the days of the week in order to avoid the pagan connotation of the planetary or deities’ names, and to keep with the biblical name, in which Monday is the “second day” (Hebrew יום שני, Greek Δευτέρα ἡμέρα (Deutéra hēméra), Latin feria secunda, Arabic الأثنين).

Likewise read the tragedies of Euripides and Sophocles, or the comedies of Aristophanes, and compare their influence on the Elizabethan stage to the Bible’s influence. Yes, Shakespeare referenced religious stories for his audience; however, he never claimed any specific religion. His cleverness appeased his Protestant Queen and Catholic King equally. 

Deny all you wish. The facts are obvious to any intelligent and discerning reader.","lqgzqcm"

Does he have reformist takes, sure, but the core is still there. Meanwhile him adopting many ideas from The Republic was not going to happen, or is a downright hilarious thought in the cases of some of those on women etc! Look what he pictures in Du contrat social, Émile or Julie - differences between how boys and girls are brought up, cosy nuclear families as a (spectacularly hypocritical) ideal. (and much as I couldn't resist heckling that his notion of a primitive state seemed so very familiar to cosy rural nuclear families!) It just, despite the way he lived himself, wouldn't even make sense for him to be able to reframe his entire world like that.

Obviously they weren't US Evangelicals. Those are a bizarre blip who seem to willfully have very little to do with historical European Christianity (and derived ideas). (And I'm increasingly having to try to tell the conspiratorial sods that French Revolutionaries weren't simply the evil atheists they'd like to imagine, but could have deep religious feeling, which frequently only makes them even madder about it. If Evangelicals were half as sincerely religious, they wouldn't be half as bad, and I'm a committed atheist)

Yes, *of course* Neoclassicism is crucial to this period. That doesn't mean Christianity isn't important. Or even that Rousseau's Swiss upbringing (and Marat's) and the impressions that gave them of what a state could be isn't. It all matters.

Even just pragmatically, like all people in any time and place, they were going to draw on previous ideas, yes, but also just use takes on them that supported what they wanted (now that, Evangelicals can do). So, shiny ideals of Classical Republics, yes, as evidence, look, it's not just us coming up with something crazy, this can be a real thing, it's not unreasonable to say we could have a Republic. That doesn't mean their image of what that means is especially accurate to what even the real Roman Republic was (would have much less place for the middle class and social mobility than wanted).","lqh5uft"
