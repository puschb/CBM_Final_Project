In its essence, the book is standard conservative political propaganda — an anecdote-driven, broad-brush attack on legislators trying to solve contemporary social problems and on the executive branch officials trying to enforce the country’s laws.

This is decline of western civilization-level bad. This is apparently the new normal for federal jurisprudence. Mere activism. Like a kitsch version of justice.",""
"ls89tgi","Porn_actor_JD","2024-10-16 17:13:40 UTC","I agreed with much of the article, but the author missed an obvious point here. Gorsuch bemoans the Fisherman’s 30 day loss of liberty, imagining what it must have done to his family. Well, in poor neighborhoods in America, a lot of people have lost family members for much longer for doing much less. Gorsuch is a hypocrite because there seems to be no criminal law too harsh for him when it comes to non-white collar defendants, but corporate criminals should be above the law. This is a justice who has voted to keep innocent people behind bars and deny them a right of appeal. Yet he would foreclose the government from acting when it’s trying to protect our fish stocks from lawless commercial fisherman.",""

"ls8ylpn","Literature-Just","2024-10-16 19:23:24 UTC","I've been working through the book and came across this same article. And when it comes to the fish story; I disagree with the reviewer. The reason the case is as onerous as it stands is that it, in my opinion, begs the question: is it just to send a man to federal prison because he caught some fish that were below the size threshold set by the department of fish and wildlife (an unelected body). I know some of you out there agree with this as a matter of fact simply because it IS ridiculous to throw someone in prison for such a thing using a law that was designed for prosecuting an offender that is far more odious than a man running a fishing business (Enron). I'm none too familiar with the laws concerning the capture of fish but it is my understanding that most people receive a fine from Game Wardens and not 30 days in a federal prison over the holidays and labeled a felon. I think that is the point Gorsuch is making here that prima facie this does seem cruel and unusual. I also hope those who disagree will read the case law and see that if you agree with the sentence against John Yates, you're siding with supreme court justices that you more than likely find much more reprehensible than Neal Gorusch (Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas).

Another point for consideration is that the reviewer even agrees with Gorsuch in the case that rich, powerful people are at ease in an environment of over-legislation because they can afford expensive lawyers to represent their interests should they run afoul of the law. This is absolutely true. Legal representation is very expensive. And when we live in a society that is governed by so many different laws then, yes, it becomes very difficult to navigate the laws of the country for those who are unable to afford good representation.

For those of you who seem upset about a sitting supreme court justice writing a book... well. I enjoy that a sitting supreme court justice took the time to write a book as it gives me a window into the thoughts of a supreme court justice. I don't always have time to review the proceedings of the supreme court unless I've taken a very special interest in the topics. 

Also, I disagree with the reviewer, in general, because he brings a lot of baggage into his article, and it clearly leaks out of his writing. For example, he comes down hard on the text for omitting the eyewitness testimony of a worker who saw the business owner throwing fish overboard. I feel like this is a minor oversight, and it does not do much to change my opinion on the matter at hand. I can come to understand how one could take the matter to task, however, as, nonetheless, it is an omission of a fact of the case.",""

https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/17-1618

I'm not a lawyer, but the gist of the opinion seems to be this: 

* If you would not fire a male person for being attracted to a female person, it's sex-based discrimination when you fire a female person for being attracted to a female person. Vice versa in the other direction.

* If you would not fire a female person for calling herself a woman, you cannot fire a male person (i.e. someone born with the biological traits that usually result in someone who sees themselves as a man) for calling herself a woman. Same thing in the other direction.

The problem tends to be that there are a lot of laws and there are very broad laws which means the laws then become arbitrary through the choice of enforcement.

Take as an example resisting arrest. It is a very broad, subjective law which, instead of just prohibiting a very specific set of activity, gives a police officer broad discretionary power that they can selectively use only when they want to. Due to that nature, its a power that often gets abused by police officers.

And whether someone was a Founder (did they have to just be in the convention, or did they have to vote a the end, or could they not be in the convention but have played an important role like Jefferson, and are we counting the state conventions?) is just as complicated as ""the public"", was it anyone in the US, was it people who could vote? Did they have to meet voter qualifications in just their state or would any state do? If someone could qualify in MA but not in Virginia but they lived in VA, are they the public? How about women and enslaved people? Are Indians part of the public? What if they're one of the ""Civilized"" tribes? What if they were converts? Are people under 21?
