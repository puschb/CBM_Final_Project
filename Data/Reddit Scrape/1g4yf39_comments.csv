A lot of this is an interior design question. You might want to ask in a couple of those subs. Or just browse them for ideas.

Although honestly I think designer-y people can take the visual display side of books too far. For example some people shelve books by color. (To be fair that does work for some people.) A wilder example is turning the books so the spines face inward and you just see pages. I’ve actually seen photos doing that, but I question if they actually read or just see the books as design props.

You’ll have to decide where on the spectrum you want to land. Do you want to aim mostly for usability, mostly for visuals, or somewhere in the middle?",""

"ls8nqgn","HorseWestern62","2024-10-16 18:26:16 UTC","I've always found organizing books is half the fun of owning them. When I first moved in with my partner, we also faced the ‘grand bookshelf dilemma’. For us, it ended up becoming a fun activity where we got to decide how to put our personalities into our shelves. What we did was mix things up a bit. Key books that have special meaning or that just look really cool go out on a main shelf. Anything that we reference often, like cookbooks or travel guides, get their own little space too. I remember I kept a Harry Potter set right in the middle – because you gotta represent your classics, right? 

Some people like to organize by color for that whole rainbow aesthetic, but I can never find anything that way. I usually just go with a loose genre or mood-based organization, like placing thrillers separate from romance novels to keep it interesting. Oh, and if you have any decorative stuff, like a globe or a quirky bookend, that can break things up nicely and let your personality shine through. The overall goal is to make it a little piece of art that you can still actually use, you know? Even adding little keepsakes or photos between books can give it a cozier vibe without cluttering it up. Just ever so often, do a little reshuffle to keep things fresh... or buy more books.",""

My library has a shelf for donations that anyone can go and pick up something from in order to own rather than to borrow with no strings so I like giving my used books to them.

But how do I pick what to keep? Marie Kondo it. ""Does having this book make me happy? Am I ever actually going to read/re-read it? Do I think others will get more joy in owning it than I do?""

I have 5 bookshelves around my house of various sizes. Prettier books and things that are more universally appealing to people go in common areas that guests might go into. The books I love the most and that lack universal appeal go in my bedroom. The in-between go in common areas that guests rarely, if ever, go into but that other family might go into.

If you only have one shelf and you're mostly concerned about aesthetics, prettier books up top, less pretty books below. I try to put similar size books together on my public shelves. Hardbacks with hardbacks, paperbacks with paperbacks. Barnes & Noble classics with Barnes & Noble classics. Penguin books with Penguin books.

Personally I like to sort my bookshelf as such. (It's five shelves tall.)

shelf 1- My personal favorite books, from Shakespeare to coin collections given to me by my grandma. I like to organize this layer with the tall books on the end and short ones in the middle to create an arch effect.

shelf 2- fiction books organized by the author's last name.

shelf 3- my larger ""coffee table"" books, books of maps, art and paintings, pictures, etc. Some I stack on their faces some sit upright.

shelf 4 & 5- non fiction books by genre then by author last name, going something like history, biography, philosophy/general living, science, nature, film.

I have some minor sorting preferences, I like to put all my higher quality prints in one section because I think they look nice next to each other. I also switch between my large books being on the middle shelf and the bottom shelf, anything on 1, 2, or 4 looks strange.

For storage purposed I tend to keep tattered books or ones that I'm not fond of in other areas or boxes, I have a large handful of pulp scifi/western books that were fun one time reads but aren't in good shape. I've found over the years that a well organized/well curated bookshelf is actually a pretty good talking point whenever people are over.

I'm mostly a believer in curating your stuff to fit your space (vs. buying more furniture to accommodate your stuff). So whenever it looks like I'm accumulating books faster than I can read them, I pick out 1-2 that don't ""light me up"" as much as they might have before. Could be any of the following reasons:

* Never particularly liked the cover
* Don't see myself rereading it
* Didn't end up liking it
* Been sitting unread for years, but could easily find another copy when I do feel like reading it

And I put the 1-2 picks in my closet until I decide what to do with it weeks/months later. Usually they go to a Little Free Library or get passed along to friends/family.
