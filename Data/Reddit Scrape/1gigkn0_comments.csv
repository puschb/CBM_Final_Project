*The Last Hurrah*, Edwin O'Connor.

In non-fiction:

TH White's *Making of The President* series feels surprisingly fresh for being as old as they are.

Michener's *Report of the County Chairman* is a perennial favorite, though I'm sure it's because I'm partial to Michener as a novelist and we share a love for Pennsylvania.

John Jacobs's *A Rage For Justice: The Passion and Politics of Phillip Burton* was a gift from an old lover and reads well about when paid with Richardson's *Willie Brown* and *Season of the Witch* by Talbot - you get a sense of the political world that created Kamala Harris.

Miriam Pawe turns anything she touches into gold. *Browns of California* is the first time somebody has tried to tackle the entire family they produced two California Governors, while her biography of Cesar Chavez and her work on the UFW are similarly vibrant and set Chavez clearly in the context of post-New Deal California.

"lviwmms","MightBe465","2024-11-05 14:17:42 UTC","Manufacturing Consent (by Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman). Its introduction quotes an introduction written by George Orwell intended for Animal Farm. Orwell's introduction briefly discusses how Britain, a relatively liberal and democratic country, also had systems of control and censorship, which were generally driven by business interests and at-least-somewhat-upper-class social norms rather than explicit legal prohibitions. I don't either book in front of me, but I believe this was quoted excerpt from Orwell's introduction, which, perhaps not incidentally, couldn't make it to print in the British press:

  
""Unpopular ideas can be silenced, and inconvenient facts kept dark, without the need for any official ban. Anyone who has lived long in a foreign country will know of instances of sensational items of news—things which on their own merits would get the big headlines—being kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that ‘it wouldn’t do’ to mention that particular fact. So far as the daily newspapers go, this is easy to understand. The British press is extremely centralised, and most of it is owned by wealthy men who have every motive to be dishonest on certain important topics. But the same kind of veiled censorship also operates in books and periodicals, as well as in plays, films and radio. At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question. It is not exactly forbidden to say this, that or the other, but it is ‘not done’ to say it, just as in mid-Victorian times it was ‘not done’ to mention trousers in the presence of a lady. Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing, either in the popular press or in the highbrow periodicals.""

Manufacturing Consent's analysis is essentially a breakdown of how this ""not done"" stuff works in the United States. I think its use of certain principals, such as ""filters"" as a means of explaining how certain ideologies make it to print, are at least as important for understanding politics in liberal democracies as Orwell's doublethink.",""

It isn't normal or healthy to get defensive over someone commenting on a work of history. It certainly isn't normal to take criticism of an academic work personally. Me pointing out that Elton is a bad recommendation for Tudor history isn't some slight on your character.","lv6yrsk"

"lv71uns","bigjoeandphantom3O9","2024-11-03 16:03:08 UTC","It isn't that I *prefer* them, it is that it is out of date, and fails to represent where the historiography currently is. I'm not criticising you, and it is bizarre that you'd take a criticism of a book written by someone you've never met as a personal criticism rather than a statement about a history book.","lv71d5b"

"lv74ruj","bigjoeandphantom3O9","2024-11-03 16:18:21 UTC","That quote is from at least 1977. It is an outdated recommendation to say the least. 

I have no idea why you are so personally attached to this book, or have taken such great offence to my pointing out that it is out of date. It is genuinely a bit unhinged that you are this sensitive to correction.","lv73abx"

"lv76vr6","bigjoeandphantom3O9","2024-11-03 16:29:18 UTC","I'm struggling to understand why you are so attached to this book? Are you just an egomaniac that is terrified at the idea of being corrected? You don't even seem to particularly like the book, the author, or the topic, considering you've said absolutely nothing about the book itself, just repeated ancient quotes about it.

It's an out of date book. There are much better places to start with Tudor history. It isn't that deep.","lv767o0"
