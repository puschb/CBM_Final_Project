Drawing breath, she seems to grow a little taller in her seat. ‚ÄúI can tell you that Appalachian people felt betrayed by that book a long time before he became a Republican politician. I‚Äôll begin by saying: anyone is entitled to write a memoir. That‚Äôs his story, fine. But for him to say that his story explains all of us ‚Äì I say, no, I resent that, because it‚Äôs very condescending. There‚Äôs this subtext all the way through it that suggests we‚Äôre in a boat that‚Äôs sinking because we‚Äôre lazy, unambitious and uncreative, which I resent.‚Äù",""

""Back in Tucson, her interview tapes began to pile up in what she describes as an ‚Äúimpugning‚Äù way; in the end, she wrote Holding the Line because she saw ‚Äúno other decent option‚Äù. Only later did it occur to her that the story had historic implications: ‚ÄúThis was the moment when the forces of capital teamed with governments to crush labour. A lot of it turned [in the US] on the air traffic controller strike [of 1981]. Reagan broke that strike overnight. He fired 11,000 unionised controllers in a single morning and then ‚Äì this is the really shocking part ‚Äì he banned them from working in the federal service ever again.

The mainstream media spent months ruminating on the election and trying to figure out how they were so wrong about Hilary winning. They latched onto *Hillbilly Elegy* because it seemed to communicate the same attitudes that were coming from Trump voters. And so the book blew up as an ""explanation of how Trump won"" when really it was never intended as anything other than ""my life in Appalachia and how i feel about my hometown."" 

(Remember, *Vance was a never Trumper in 2016.*)

But with fame comes corruption, and in Vance's case it seems that when the *Hillbilly Elegy* movie got blasted for being a piece of garbage (which it objectively was from a movie standpoint), he took those criticisms way too personally. Because that's when he started caring about politics and cozying up to Trump and Co.

Vance is the perfect example of how political power corrupts. He was not a ""good"" person before he wrote his book, but neither was he as ""bad"" as a lot of people want to believe, and his book was very forthcoming and honest about how his life had gone and what he saw in his community, even if most of his community thought he was wrong. His downfall has been that he couldn't handle the fame that came with the book, or perhaps more accurately he couldn't handle the criticism that came with the fame. And he decided to give up the decent parts of himself in order to gain the power required to hit back at those critics.

I used to have high hopes that he could lead a new generation of conservatives who didn't bow the knee to Trump. I was wrong, and I'm still a little bitter about it to be honest.","lqn06gw"

Each community is isolated, I lived in a county bordering another state, literal 20 minute drive, and yet knew several people who had never left the county in their entire lives.

You find pockets of hippies who just want to live close to nature.

Plenty of outdoor enthusiasts who are there to rock climb or whitewater or mountain bike, etc.

You find seniors who like the quiet

You find universities

You find farms

You find ruins of abandoned industries

You find solar farms and windmills

You find those who just want to be left alone.

You find those who want a close community where they know the name of everyone in town.

You find world class Radio Telescopes

You find stunning vistas of nature on display and hillsides logged to the ground.

You find shacks with a winter‚Äôs worth of firewood stacked out front around the corner from multimillion dollar mountain chateaus.

There are certainly common causes that most ‚Äúworkers‚Äù can get behind, and arguably all ‚Äúworkers‚Äù *should* get behind, but they are fairly high-level and broad. But even something like ‚Äúhigh taxes for the ownership class‚Äù is pretty broad. Is the goal to eliminate an ownership class at all through these taxes? Make sure that all basic needs are provided for? Cap the theoretical amount of income inequality? Wealth inequality? Cap it where?

For any specific, non-trivial, policy ‚Äúworkers‚Äù will be by definition not ‚Äúunited.‚Äù Anything like a government can only handle so much contradiction before it breaks. If 90% of the members of the new all-powerful and united ‚ÄúFourth International‚Äù (is that what number we‚Äôre on now?) decide that the best thing is if the airport ticket checkers get paid the same as the tarmac workers, and that if the tarmac workers stop working because they are sick of being sucked into jet engines they will be labeled counter-revolutionaries and suffer whatever those consequences are, that 90% will matter a lot more than a small number of people truly committed to ‚Äúuniversal standards.‚Äù

I really think that a more just world can only come from firm labor unions that can freely form coalitions with and against each other on a midi scale, some variation of our current Democratic systems but more focus on adjudication and arbitration and less on direct policy-making, and economic/capital markets focused on ownership by defined collectives of individuals rather than by massive groups of individuals turned into amorhous blobs of capital. Basically coming at Socialism from Liberalism rather than the other way around, because ‚Äúunity‚Äù is ultimately more about exclusion than inclusion, and I don‚Äôt think that society can make a workable large-scale incentive structure without some degree of income / inequality.

On a social level I‚Äôd like to shift the concept of ‚Äúownership‚Äù into something more like ‚Äústewardship,‚Äù and shift the default economic unit from families to communes of ~150 people.

But mostly I want to stop worrying about what ‚Äútrue socialism‚Äù might look like and start expressing our values and deciding what policies and structures they might bring from nothing into a fuzzy focus, and start to move on from there.","lqpbkkh"

There is nothing more American than that. Caring for your fellow man only goes so far. American society was built on the ideals that anyone can build themselves up in this country. Is it a perfect bastion of the ideal? No. But it's a work in progress just like everything else.

"lqtcxek","AllFalconsAreBlack","2024-10-07 18:21:39 UTC","I think the methods employed to garner sympathy were very different. Whereas Dickens used humor and absurdity, Kingsolver used sarcastic self-pity and ironically tragic observation. Whereas Dickens introspectively analyzed personal flaws and active complicity in immoral behavior, Kingsolver remained extrospective and left agency out of the portrayal. The traumatic influences were amplified, addiction was added to the equation, and yet the psychological struggle remained specific to fatalistic internalization. Both characterizations involved a certain narrative duplicity in their recollective perspectives, but while Dickens's portrayal reflected a psychological and moral development of character, Kingsolver's felt like a finished product from the start. And all of goes without mentioning how Kingsolver included things like an exceptional athleticism and attractiveness to her character.

So, do I think the exceedingly sympathetic main character was similar in Kingsolver's adaptation? Yes. Do I think such a sympathetic character was necessary in the context of such traumatic experience? Most definitely.

You are, you're just engaging in sophistry.

But I'll bite. The statement, ""Appalachian people enjoy cornbread,"" could mean that the average Appalachian person enjoys cornbread, or it could mean that among the people of Appalachia, some of them enjoy cornbread. In other words that statement is a little unclear in just how many Appalachian people are the subject of the sentence in that it could mean all of them, most of them, some of them, or just a few of them, because we don't know if ""Appalachian people"" refers to individual Appalachian people, or to the overall community of people from Appalachia. Does ""people"" refer to plural individuals or a single community? That's the ambiguity here.

The statement ""The Appalachian people enjoy cornbread,"" is much less ambiguous. While we still don't know to what extent the people approve of cornbread, the statement clarifies that ""people"" refers to a singular community, and is therefore making a statement about the overall feelings of the community. It's a much clearer and stronger statement, it is capable of being untrue in circumstances where the other statement, without the ""the"" would still be true.

>But as written the ‚Äúthe‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change the meaning.

Yes, it definitely does change the meaning. Saying simply ""Appalachian people"" doesn't really require you to speak for anyone who you haven't spoken with. It's certainly, objectively true that Appalachian people don't like JD Vance or his dumbass book, because we have heard from Appalachian people who don't like him or his book. We don't really know the extent of this disapproval, but we know there are in fact Appalachian people who don't like him.

But saying ""The Appalachian people"" does almost certainly require you to speak for someone whose opinion you just don't know, because it's saying that this thing is true of the community, of the people, not just individual people.

TL;DR you're wrong, adding the ""the"" absolutely changes the meaning by clarifying that the word ""people"" is being used to refer to a single community rather than a bunch of individuals who happen to be from Appalachia.","lqnargn"
