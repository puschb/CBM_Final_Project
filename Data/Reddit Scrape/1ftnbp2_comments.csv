In my school the principal has ended all classroom visits to the library for kids to check out books, she believes it wastes instructional time. Given these kids are rushed along in the halls between classes, given less than 30 minutes for lunch and ushered out of the building within 10 minutes of the final bell.. they simply have no opportunity to come to check out books. The few who do literally skip a meal to do so. So this isn't coming out of nowhere.",""

This is probably the problem:

>This development puzzled Dames until one day during the fall 2022 semester, when a first-year student came to his office hours to share how challenging she had found the early assignments. Lit Hum often requires students to read a book, sometimes a very long and dense one, in just a week or two. But the student told Dames that, at her public high school, she had never been required to read an entire book. She had been assigned excerpts, poetry, and news articles, but not a single book cover to cover.

Because it leads to:

>Twenty years ago, Dames’s classes had no problem engaging in sophisticated discussions of Pride and Prejudice one week and Crime and Punishment the next. Now his students tell him up front that the reading load feels impossible. It’s not just the frenetic pace; **they struggle to attend to small details while keeping track of the overall plot**.

I try bringing a variety of short stories to them (the school don't give us books and the library doesn't even work), some get engaged by the stories, but lots of them get unfocused very quickly and have no interest at all on reading. They also complain about the size of the story, if it's one page, they don't say anything, but when it's 3 pages onward 'this is too long'. It's quite challenging, yes. They themselves admit that unless it's a short video they have difficult paying attention. 


The article talks about schools not stimulating reading as a habit, but I also wanna remark how parents contribute majorly on this, kids learn their habits first at home (schools most of the time are dealing with that aftermath). So parents just shoving kids at screens, don't read or buy them a single book and miraculously want them to pick up on reading.... 


I think in general reading is increasingly seen as having little value, with people preferring other ways to either learn or have fun. Which to me is very sad. ",""

Schools were teaching cueing theory - you might also know it as reading recovery or whole language, where instead of teaching kids phonics, or insisting that they memorize words, teachers were teaching kids to guess based on context cues, letters and pictures.

This creates kids who can bluff their way through simple readings with a good enough understanding of what's going on, but cause disasters when they try to advance to books with harder readings and no more pictures. 

It's funny how the science of education is so, so bad sometimes. Massive decisions are made on bad science and tiny sample sizes.

"lpti0g4","JungBlood9","2024-10-01 14:45:00 UTC","I just finished a 7-year career teaching high school English, and the expectations around reading in my career v. when I was in school were vastly different. 

The biggest contributor to the end of reading novels at school, without a doubt, is that we essentially can’t ask kids to read at home anymore. And if you aren’t reading some of the book at home, then what the hell does class look like? It takes months to read a book in 45-min class period chunks, and those 45-minutes get so monotonous and boring. But if you break it up with discussions and activities, it takes *even longer* to finish. It’s such a catch-22. 

I’ll outline all the reasons why we “can’t” assign reading at home any longer:

1) The kids straight up won’t do it bc the “no homework” movement has caught on so much that they have 0 stamina or expectation to even spend 5 minutes on a task at home. It will not happen. And when no one reads assigned homework reading, you can’t do any fun activities or discussions in class because no one did the reading. So class quickly turns into reading time. 

2) Admin and teacher training programs are squawking “equity” as another reason to kill any type of homework. And honestly, this point is pretty fair? When you assign reading at home, the kids with quiet, encouraging home environments get the work done, and the kids with the shit end of the stick (loud chaotic home, working/babysitting) don’t, and it furthers the divide. 

3) The expectation for the kind of executive function we can expect out of a teenager has plummeted. It’s considered ridiculous, if not cruel, to ask a kid to remember to bring an item to class. The books going back and forth between home and classroom? HA! Yeah 45% of the class at any given time has either forgotten or lost it. A massive portion of my job as department chair over the last 7 years has been desperately trying to clamor together the money and the time to restock the literally *hundreds* of books the kids destroy and lose each year so that we can have enough for the kids the following year. 

I hate to say it, but unless something radical happens with admin and parents, I just don’t see how it’s feasible to assign (longer) novels in class. I got away with doing 1 a year, but it was always long and grueling as a result of the above issues. It’s simply a different world now.",""

"lptzr3y","invisible_iconoclast","2024-10-01 16:22:02 UTC","I am scrolling and scrolling through comments and not seeing what is likely the biggest source of this by far: teaching whole word/whole language “reading” in kindergarten and first grade, rather than phonics.

I learned about it back in 2017 when my then stepson was sent home from kindergarten with a book to practice reading and an instruction sheet for parents that stated explicitly *not* to tell the child to sound out words, or even focus on the letters at all, but instead to *guess* based on pictures, the surrounding story, etc. This is what poor readers do. Context is something good readers use to determine *meaning* after they have already phonetically read a word, and is useless for those who can’t even read past a third-grade level (there’s a reason that’s the grade level SO many are stuck at!). I swore at that instruction sheet, immediately started Googling, went down a rabbit hole, and emerged livid. 

He can still barely read and cannot spell. His district saw their falling literacy scores and implemented a phonics curriculum in 2022, but it was too late for him, and remediation in higher grades is just too expensive for public school districts to offer.

Fortunately two years ago the investigative podcast Sold a Story was released and in the interim there are now 39 states that outright *ban* cueing in curriculum, including mine. I didn’t know that when my own child started kindergarten and the relief I felt when I saw her teacher would be using UFLI exclusively was truly immense. I had been planning to teach her how to read myself, but despite knowing the basics since she was three, she resists instruction from me and thrives in a classroom environment. Throw single-parenthood and full-time work on top, and I was dreading this year. I just finished Sold a Story a few days ago and encourage everyone to give it a listen. I loved it, despite already knowing all the information presented.

In time, this course will correct, as more states enact curriculum bans, hopefully followed by the federal government. This is a problem that has been brewing since the 1980s and was accelerated about 15 years ago. We are seeing the results now with staggeringly low levels of reading comprehension in high schoolers and ability period in adults.

Many of the kids we teach are programmed to absorb information in short bursts and often with a dose a visual imagery to go along with it. When the human brain is absorbing information in one way, all the time, and that way so quickly rewards the viewer, it’s HARD to adapt.

Comprehension depends so much on recall, and inferring from that information, and a lot of kids can’t do either, let alone both simultaneously. It will literally take years of work, and practice, to build that stamina back.

The downside is we are fighting a war on two fronts:

- Phones and other electronics will always be an inhibitor to progress. Many kids will tune out and disengage, especially when they know they have a better alternative at their fingertips.

- District initiatives often dance around the problem by requiring teachers adapt to the students in front of them, and change instruction to accommodate that. Without rigor and standards, we will continue to be missing the mark on this.",""

Younger generations not reading is a product of modern technology, and it isn’t negative per say but we have to adapt as a society and in a academia.

"lptnxep","LevitatingRevelation","2024-10-01 15:17:31 UTC","I guess a lot of people are old and staring back through rose colored glasses, especially considering the top comment in this thread and it's replies, but ""Reading"" in general isn't something that can be taught, because learning how to do it has to come from a place of interest. It seems like a lot of people seem to be forgetting that when English Teachers assigned reading assignments to their classes, at least 90% of the kids never read the book, and if they weren't doing abridged notes of the assignment, they were using spark notes which gained popularity in the late 2000s, and still exists as a means to not have to actually read from cover to cover.

>It's particular mind-bending because ""here kid, read this book"" is basically the original version of ""here kid, take this tablet"". It's practically the easiest thing for a teacher to do when dealing with English, to the point where it's legitimately hard for me to believe a majority of schools aren't doing it anymore, considering my shit tier public schools did this in almost every English course I had to take.

Like for instance, these two situations are not even remotely the same. Tablets have many different applications, with many different functions, which can draw and keep the attention of a vast majority if not everyone based on something it offers. I mean has it seriously been forgotten that the books they try and force kids to read in school end up being Shakespeare, A Handmaid's Tale, To kill a mockingbird, Catcher in the Rye, etc, etc. Okay yes, these books do have themes that Children do need to learn to shape their view of society, but they are BORING AS FUCK. NO ONE outside of someone who actually enjoys reading, would enjoy these books as a first time reader. Teacher's, The Curriculum, Schools, literally bore Children out of reading, and they do not do anything to change that, they keep the same boring literature, and end up with the same result.

I often find the most hilarious thing about these types of studies is the amount of scientific study, and just straight up conjecture that gets thrown out about how students can't ""comprehend"", they don't ""learn that way"", when quite literally the reason why they won't sit down and read is that the book is fucking god awful boring, it was boring when you were in high-school with less distractions, and it they haven't had some sparkling remaster - it's still the same boring god awful book you didn't read cover to cover.",""

"lpvjdas","el_toro7","2024-10-01 21:10:40 UTC","The problem with engaging this material is that, for these students, it's just not comprehensible input. The reason for this is that these students are not fluent enough in their native language. I know this is shocking to people, but comprehension is low because these students have not ever had to seriously engage with written English at a higher level than simple technical prose (like in manuals, guide books, simple text books, etc.), and most long-form complex English (like in movies) is aided in comprehension by the visual art (and likely still missed for its point). 

This is nothing against them, really. The ubiquity of the internet, social media, and smart-phones has made it this way. Even where schools/parents have tried to encourage reading, wherever these same schools/parents have enabled or fostered continued access to and use of these devices and technologies, they effectively take with the left hand whatever they've given with the right. 

The solution is also a bridge too far for many: the solution is that these young adults need a new, healthier relationship with technology, and at the same time, they to be put on a reading comprehension plan that gets them into comprehensible input texts, which will probably involve 18-22 year-olds reading 6th-10th grade novels and non-fiction work. 

But I think dramatic improvements can be made within a few short months. I believe that one semester of re-orienting towards devices and technologies, alongside a careful reading/analysis plan of a dozen or so books (say, one book per week--but these will at first be embarrassingly short and simple books), would do wonders for a student's mental health, confidence, and later success in post-secondary education.

My guess is students will first try to manipulate the teacher into giving them a good grade out of pity, before sitting down to read the dense text.

An educated population is essential for a healthy democracy, and I fear a hidden cause of this is the insane cost of tuition these days.

5/. Can you crushingly dismiss any mode of literary criticism in one sentence that features the following word(s): 'facile', 'specious' and/or 'bathetic'?

7/. Do you refuse to do any media interviews unless the entire programme is devoted to you? Do you threaten to walk out of the studio unless Melvyn Bragg/Dick Cavett/Michiko Kakutani allows you to smoke?

8/. In contrast with your pellucid literary style, is your personal life hoggish, corrupt, rapacious and sexually convoluted as a wormcast?

Definitely a symptom of us not teaching *how* to go about thinking things. Put simply, have ideas of your own, and then try to bash them against other ideas. 

Really simple concept, but I realized I never really had ideas of my own and tried thinking through them carefully well into college, embarassingly so. 

The internet *can* help, especially if you get into a community. I found tryhard video game circles, depending on the people ""leading"" at the time, can really inspire critical thinking in a fun way (since well you're trying to optimize a game), but sometimes not, obviously depends on the person. Since you're constantly trying to evaluate and judge ideas, and the less mature a game is, the more original an idea you can come up with, and the more you can feel like you're a pioneer = you can invent more ideas on your own = you actually know what it's like to have original ideas, how to evaluate them critically, etc. 

I find it astonishing even how some technical people (including myself) can get so far without having actual unique ideas of our own based in at least some decently thought out logical reasoning system.

------------------------------

Okay back on topic with books, yeah the reason why this stood out to me is because I used to just read books kinda uncritically, I never knew that when ""note taking"", if I ever did that, it was totally acceptable and valid to just bash on the author because *you* think it's dumb. But obviously then you have to evaluate that against other ideas, sure. But I think the desire to get a good grade definitely doesn't optimize for that kind of thinking. 

Maybe I was just dumb in high school and y'all geniuses actually did think super critically about your books, but yeah. Even though we read tons of books in high school, didn't explore this aspect much.",""

"lpw0ssk","P0pu1arBr0ws3r","2024-10-01 22:50:25 UTC","I've encountered this myself in my education.

In elementary and middle school and start of high school it was constant essays about some specific detail or aspect of the book, having to find evidence and get the overall plot. It was a lot of just a bunch of novels, or for history or science class, textbook reading. It got rather boring reading what I have to read, I often spent a long time reading somewhat late at night and then I wouldn't remember specifics, and I never got used to the idea of highlighting or writing in the book itself. It led me to find reading novels boring nowadays, however I also realize a key aspect of my understanding of learning comes from my remembering some key fact or scene I find interesting or relevant in some medium, as opposed to a more thematic or directly visual approach.

By middle school I was on track to doing CS which I'm mastering now. Then, I would be googling and stack overflowing, in high school there was a textbook for CS but it was mostly for problems and occasional reference for me. However in high school I would still have textbooks and literature bought. Sometimes we would work directly with the literature, or write directly in a textbook (across two Spanish classes I actually managed to complete 90% of a textbook work and lessons, where in most classes it would usually be up to a quarter of the book). In middle and high school both schools had a laptop program, so some of the books were accessed online and often purchased in bulk by the school, so I didn't always have to haul a giant book if a class required it daily (before then it was literally carrying a stack of books between classrooms).

Anyways, my high school was a college prep school so junior and senior year the classes were taught more as college classes, demanding more of an understanding of the themes of the material but not specifics and not strictly for novels, but perhaps more literate advanced texts (on the likes of Shakespeare and old English complex). When learning about shakespeares older works and old English, we studied more how English evolved both in text and I'm themes, and actually ended with reading Brave New World (or I read the minimum to get by adequately in the class) and then watched some movie related to it thematically. Also in that class we were instructed to read Hamlet alongside watching the movie adaptation of the play (nearly a line by line reenactment, an excellent adaptation), which really helped visualize what was going on instead of playing guesswork like with the average half-reading I do with a novel.

And then I took screenwriting, a whole new medium that was never discussed in any precious class. Sure we discussed movie adaptations and poems and short stories, even some visual novels at one point, and in other classes more full text textbooks instead of ""California standard"" books. But it made me realize how effective visual and audible mediums can be to convey what would take a novel perhaps multiple sentences to pages to describe metaphorically. How the way a scene is visualized, can directly convey the writers intent, so that I experience and understand it from what I see at that moment, instead of trying to put words to an image that I no doubt get wrong. And screenwriting is intended to be direct and literal, and that doesn't make it any less or more valid than another work of art or literature.

On a separate note, my physics C teacher had us read a book about I think natural logarithm, something not related to physics directly but a good example of the sort of open ended discussion which college may present in class. He didn't require us to read the whole book, just some excerpts and then discuss with us. This is quite similar to what I'm doing now in one of my classes...

Now in undergrad, I went into CS at an engineering school, took some basic writing and rhetoric classes, not much for literature. I took a visual rhetoric class, which was about how to visualize thoughts and ideas, interesting as it broke away from traditional essays or reports. I also had some history/social science classes and a creative writing class where I read some primary and secondary sources, which is more interesting and understanding as opposed to reading some long research report or novel chapter, but they were set up as intro courses which was all my CS major required, so what I did in high school as general college prep was actually more than what I did in undergrad. But when it came to textbooks, sometimes the university would bulk buy, but otherwise I would only get if I actually need it, and I would look for a free copy first- tuition would estimate some $200+ for textbooks, most I'd pay is $60 if I can't rent and cant find it for free. And all digital wherever possible, so I could create digital notes and bookmarks and keep a library without taking up space (generally I think digital books are superior, but I won't stop you from enjoying paper only if that's your preference). Eventually my classes focused on projects and work rather than tests and reciting material, so the textbooks became references and I ended up not reading much in my junior and senior years. However I did do gsme development with my CS degree, so some of the classes involved looking st games from a literature and art perspective, to provide another perspective on how to depict or convey a story and events.

Now in my CS masters program, its about the same as undergrad minus the general classes, with one exception: research. I'm in an HCI class, which is essentially my introduction to what academic research is as we are having to read 10+ page research papers twice a week. Like novels, I'm getting bored with them, and they aren't all of my interest, but some of them and their details are of interest, and part of the class we discuss the contents of the papers as they relate to human centered computing. Theres a lot of detail that honestly I could care less about, but it is factual and at least intended not to be as open ended as some creative literature.

In the end, I think the constant requirements to read books made me dislike reading later on in school, until I actually experienced some other works than the standard choice in elementary and middle school. Being able to enjoy a bookkr literature and understand it doesn't mean you can read a book quickly and remember every little detail, but rather theres different ways which people can understand a work, whether its reading it quickly, reading it alongside an audiobook, seeing it pictured, or seeing a writers interpretation in the form of a screenplay or movie, or viewing the results in raw form or summarized in research. You could learn material better one way than another, but school isn't always designed to allow you to experiment with new ways to learn and comprehend and retain material. And in the real life, while being able to comprehend literature and art can make you enjoy it better, its not practical unless you're going into that field, whether in research or in practice.",""

While I understand the need for the breadth of texts at that level, it becomes like a mechanical process at some point , mostly looking for passages / quotes for essays rather than reading simply for pleasure.

I regularly read classic literature like Jane Austen. I just can't imagine getting to adulthood and not being able to read an entire book (or not having the motivation to). ",""
"lpz9mw1","LiteraryTimeTraveler","2024-10-02 14:17:57 UTC","I’m a high school librarian and taught middle school for over a decade. My two cents is that teachers are trying. Kids are often not invested in school the way they once were. There are good reasons for this, but it is still terribly problematic. Plus, with the advancement in tech (eg: social media, smart phones, artificial intelligence) their ability to pay attention for long periods of time and/or work at something difficult for an extended span of time is completely shot. I feel like this problem is a multi-layered onion, so much so that it feels impossible to solve because it’s so dynamic.",""

When I was in elementary school (4th grade), I remember choosing to read Anne of Green Gables, not because I wanted to necessarily,  but because we were required to read a certain number of pages within a given interval of time that our parents had to sign off on. We then had to write a blurb about the book. I can't remember exact specifics, but I remember feeling like it was an impossible task- but I did it. And I was very proud that I did. 

In high school, I remember sometimes I would buy the cliff notes version of books if I didn't want to read a book required for school (bad, I know). The internet was around, but not like what we have today. I would just take the bus to the book store and find what I needed.

Nowadays, if you want to write a book report or engage in a class discussion without actually reading the book, there are a plethora of free resources on the internet. Heck, just the other day, I looked up Lord of the Flies on wiki to remind myself of the plot (I actually did read that one cover to cover).

La Ilíada y la Odisea son textos complicados que requieren conocimientos sobre mitología griega y mitos para saber interpretarla. También, es un texto que viene del griego... No todas las traducciones ni todas las notas son iguales. Según la edición te sueles encontrar prólogos con debates a favor y en contra sobre debates de su origen. Es más, la mayoría de la gente no entiende porque extrapola lo que ve en la película de la guerra de troya y espera encontrar algo parecido en la Ilíada... ¿Cómo abordas un libro cuando todo el conocimiento popular ha sido dilapidado por el cine? Si mucha gente que conozco se la ha leído y no sabe que es  Ilión.

  
A lo que voy es que justamente esta obra no te da conocimientos, requiere conocimientos previos y herramientas para entender. Encima la ilíada que está llena de dioses y sus relaciones entre ellos. Los dioses son prácticamente los protagonistas del libro. 

  
Creo que recomendar a alguien sin conocimientos que se lea la ilíada es de las mayores putadas que le puedes hacer y probablemente le hagas odiar la literatura clásica... Si un profesor se quiere poner subidito y recomendar una obra griega podría recomendar Edipo rey de Sófocles que es una forma perfecta de entender la diferencia entre el ciclo épico y el ciclo tebano y después seguir escarbando en la literatura griega.

  
Yo entiendo que la gente ya no lee. No lee nada. Casi todos los libros que busco están descatalogados. Las ediciones bilingües no se encuentran salvo que pagues por libros antiguos un alto precio.

I hate how there seems to be no winning in the current education system. On the one hand your dilemma is 1,000% legitimate (I'm a writer and work in a library too, so don't interpret this as devaluing the need for reading), but my sister is a middle school English teacher and I get the other side as well. Her class periods are literally 45 minutes. Just getting everyone to settle in for class takes five, and the last five are basically shot as everyone gets antsy because she can't waste any time for breaks or slowing the pace down—she has standards she needs to hit after all. 

On a good day she'll have about a half hour of instructional time, and on a bad day she'll never really get their attention for any one of a dozen reasons.

American education needs to be torn down to the ground and built up again because it's not working for *literally anyone*.","lptgzn5"

I went through college on a six course load, volunteering in honor society charities, and two part time research labs, wrote an honors thesis, while being in a relationship. This is while I watched many of my friends from high school overdose and die from heroin, be killed by gangs, and go to prison.

I tried my damnedest to get through the Odyssey in college (having also gotten about halfway through it in high school) just to start school on the right foot, but still managed to fall short.

At the end of the day, academics alone take up a significant portion of a student's time, especially with the work across all classes. I barely had time to study for APUSH, AP Physics, do all my math homework, etc. and also read half a book I may or may not be particularly interested in in a week, and that's before factoring in having some semblance of a social life, familial obligations, extracurriculars like band taking up a healthy chunk of time, depending on the season. I also didn't have a job in high school, but that's a not-insignificant factor for many students too.

And I know the article suggests that students currently aren't required to read entire books, but in my case, I was required to and ended up batting 1 for \\[insert gobsmackingly high number of books here\\]. I inevitably picked up more than my share of bad habits and wrong lessons on time management from my successes anyway, but it did teach me to pay attention in discussion, what details to mine for a passing understanding of the whole work, and how to write convincingly well enough that I had the slightest clue what I was talking about.

All to say, it's asking a lot of kids to tear through a book they may not even enjoy, written in an English that's all-too-often hard to parse when language has evolved so much in intervening centuries, on top of whatever other academic obligations are also vying for what little time they have, doubled down if they're not particularly fast readers (I know I'm not). I understand that rushed feeling all too well (and I love reading! There are even some of those books I missed back in HS and college that I'm circling back around to actually devour as an adult), and I'm not sure how much of that can realistically be fixed on a fairly breakneck reading schedule outside of learning how to get as much out of a given class reading as you can while accepting you might not be able to get through it all in the allotted time.","lpt205h"

"lpuxkib","Blarghnog","2024-10-01 19:18:27 UTC","The problem is much deeper than just substituting one educational approach for another. Instead of assigning full texts and encouraging thoughtful analysis, schools now often pull brief excerpts from books and ask students to complete worksheets that demand simplistic, predetermined answers. This shift fundamentally distorts how students engage with literature.

I recently recommended Henry David Thoreau’s Walking to a teenage girl I know, and we read about 50 pages together, passing the book back and forth. By the end, she was in tears, utterly moved by the beauty of the prose and its remarkable depth. I bought her a copy, and she said something that struck me: “I’ve never read anything like this in school. I didn’t even know writing could be so beautiful.”

This points to a profound issue in our education system. The prescriptive, reductionist approach inherent in Common Core is directly responsible for displacing deep, meaningful reading. By breaking books down into fragments and converting them into exercises, the system reduces even the most beautiful writing into a mechanical task. It turns literature into a burden rather than an intellectual and emotional experience.

Many argue that technology and shortened attention spans are the primary reasons students no longer engage with long-form texts, but this ignores the core issue. The systematic deconstruction of literature under the guise of standardization has stripped away its richness. The goal of Common Core is clear in its name: to create a uniform curriculum that can be measured and compared across schools. In this pursuit, students are deprived of the chance to grapple with great works of literature that once inspired past generations. Instead, they are given bite-sized portions, designed to meet benchmarks rather than provoke thought or wonder.

The true tragedy is that in focusing on what can be easily measured, the system has lost sight of the larger purpose of education. Rather than exposing young minds to transformative works of literature, it has reduced learning to a series of tasks to check off a list. Students are being denied access to the kind of writing that has the power to elevate, challenge, and inspire. In this way, they are robbed of the very thing that education should offer: a glimpse into a larger world of ideas, experiences, and possibilities.

The focus of education has become raising the floor, emphasizing reading comprehension rates and ensuring that no child is left behind. While these objectives may sound commendable, they miss the essence of education entirely. Children rise to the level of expectation set for them, and when teaching becomes an exercise in managing metrics—ensuring basic comprehension and meeting standardized goals—the system consigns most students to the lowest common denominator. The result is an uninspired, mechanical engagement with literature that fails to cultivate curiosity or a deeper intellectual life. Instead of challenging students to reach their full potential, this approach keeps them tethered to mediocrity, depriving them of the profound experiences and transformative ideas that only great literature can provide.

Sorry to all the teachers that have to work in and defend our current system on this one: I strongly feel our current approach is failed.","lpt205h"

Then something has to give, it's not a matter of good discipline and time management.

Now his students tell him up front that the reading load feels impossible. It’s not just the frenetic pace; they struggle to attend to small details while keeping track of the overall plot.

Even if there's a problem with schools not requiring students to actually read a dang book, I could sympathize with the students here, if they're actually being expected to read books of the length of Pride and Prejudice every week. I have an English degree from 20 years ago and that is not a book length I would have encountered with a 1-week reading time in any of my classes. We had like two weeks to read Nabokov's *Ada* one semester and I am pretty sure I'm one of the only people in the class that finished it, because I didn't have to work more than one weekend a month and I had a light schedule in a couple other classes; that class had easily the most intense reading load of any of my English classes. I wasn't a fast reader at the time, but I'm much slower now. Pride and Prejudice could easily be 20 hours of reading for me, which would mean that just the reading material is already over the expected weekly homework load for a 3-credit class. Add in a paper that ought to take at least a few hours to write and it's the same load as some of my 4-credit upper division math courses, for a freshman-level literature course that's probably a gen ed. There's no way in hell I'm getting through Crime and Punishment in a week if I have anything else to do in my life, unless I'm skimming some parts and doing zero critical thinking or reflection.

I wonder how many of the professor's students 20 years ago were actually reading those books for the first time and actually finishing them, and how many were just using cliff notes to have sophisticated discussions. What's the possibility that a few students now are just more honest and actually telling the professor something no one would have whined about in the past?

Professors, particularly those with long careers, can sometimes assign books with an unrealistically short reading and digestion time, because their perception of how long it takes is skewed by having read it multiple times before and having had years to digest it, so they think of how long it took them the last time they went through it.","lpt205h"

_Uh, stuff that diagnoses your ability to critically engage with the text? The likelihood of a question asking something about the text is gonna be pretty directly proportional to how important that thing is to the text? You can gauge what aspects are important by, you know, understanding the text? Like, do you just want me to tell you the answers right now, or…_

They also get uncomfortable if you teach just by talking and demonstrating stuff on a board instead of having PowerPoint notes. Even if I do make a PowerPoint, I don't write whole-ass paragraphs on there or even very many bullet points, and a slide might just be a single word or image as a visual aid for what I'm talking about. So I never understand when they complain that I didn't ""upload that PowerPoint."" ""Bro, it was the word _coherentism_ and a photograph of a web. If you didn't write down what the class verbally discussed, looking at this slide at home ain't gonna help you know shit, so what's the point of uploading it?""

Thankfully, over the course of the semester, students get used to not being spoonfed everything and genuinely start to enjoy just critically thinking and discussing the materials.

Students in the past didn’t have audiobooks or youtube to ai or sparknotes, they literally had books and eachother. Every minute students spend nowadays with advanced tech, like all mentioned above, that is less time in their lives they ever had a chance to grow reading skills. 

I can read a whole text for english class in 9th grade, infer my own information, write a paper, and still perform poorly because maybe I didn’t understand.

Using these resources is a skill in their own right, never think otherwise, but then you get what we have here. Students never had an opportunity to grow as readers and writers in book and textbook knowledge, they grew as multimedia readers and writers.

That skills is as useful, if not arguably more useful in this tech world, than reading books. Don’t believe me? You can see it for yourself.

I have had a student who was attempting an assessment. The first task of the assessment is like,

""1. Go to the Blackboard shell for this class. Navigate to the same place you downloaded this assessment sheet and download the file called 'Ergonomic Checklist'. Fill out the checklist and include it with your final submission.""

He calls me over and says he doesn't know what to do. I'm always happy to provide clarification but I try to help students get to the solution themselves. So when someone asks me for help I start by getting them to summarise what they think an instruction means or what they've tried so far.

This kid just says ""I don't know."" when I ask him to elaborate. I ask if he's read the instructions and he says no. So I tell him ""OK, can you try reading them, and then we'll see if they make sense?""

He turns back to the word doc on the page with this first task. He flicks the scroll wheel back and forth to slide the page around. Then he turns back to me. ""I don't know what it means.""

I say to him, ""What does the instructions tell you?""

He say, ""I don't know.""

I say, ""Can you please read it out to me?""

So he does, then still says ""I don't know what to do.""

I ask him to read the first sentence again ('go to the blackboard shell for this class').

He does, and I say ""Ok what do you think that means?""

He finally concedes a bit. ""I need to go to the blackboard website?""

So on and so forth until we get all the way through.

 In today's economy, your students more than likely are working (and not everyone qualifies for work study, so it's hard jobs like food service, retail, low paying education jobs, low pay manual labor, etc) and likely have to take care of family members as well. Then they also have to stay ful- time to keep any scholarship money they have, so that's more credits than just your class. Then if they are planning to do something after college, they will also have to have volunteer hours, unpaid internships, research projects, leadership, clubs, shadowing, etc. And not to mention students who are athletes or other students that have scholarships that require extracurriculars. 

In an ideal world, yes, students would sit and read the textbooks and the assigned readings multiple times all the way through but that's just not how it is. 

I am not saying that students always deserve a study guide (I only had them in some lower undergrad classes and that was for math classes and I graduated from undergrad pretty recently) or that the other factors of how schools taught reading and writing haven't impacted this, the rest of my professors never did them), just that I really dislike the narrative that oversimplifies a complicated narrative.","lpt4a64"

We have extra tissues on hand and the bathrooms are ready to receive students who need a more private moment. It's an important milestone in our curriculum because a classroom full of sobbing 11 year olds is a classroom full of children getting to experience what it's like to be a human being. 

Another similar moment is when our second graders read Charlotte's Web. It's the first time in our curriculum where we ask our students to face squarely - but still age appropriately - questions about death. Fern takes in Wilbur because she insists it isn't fair to kill him because he's a runt. To prove her ""wrong"" her father forces her to take care of him and bottle feed him as if he were a human baby, as of to say ""you think this pig falls into the same moral category as you and I? You think it's a question if injustice to kill a pig who will only cause problems later? Go ahead and pretend - let's see how it works out for you."" Later on, Wilbur panics when he realizes that he's still food, and is forces to face his own impending mortality. Charlotte is the one that guides him through his crisis. 

And this is important! The ""human"" animals in E.B. White's novels are not at all like the ""human"" animals of Narnia. What is it like to eat a strip of bacon and think of Wilbur? I don't believe we have a moral obligation to be vegetarian, but we're not fooling anybody by hiding the complexity that comes from being a meat creature that eats other meat creatures. 

(There's this bear that Susan kills in Prince Caspian, in the heat of the moment to save their lives, but she turns deadly pale because she acts not knowing whether he murdered a talking bear of human moral worth, or a mere ""dumb beast."")

There is a direct and bright line from Charlotte's Web to Where the Red Fern Grows, to East of Eden and Crime and Punishment; a curriculum of novels help human beings to understand their humanity and the perennial issues we face.

We have books in the house (some argue this is a privilege - miss me with that shit. Libraries exist, you can buy books for less than a dollar each at thrift stores even now - it’s not privilege, it’s prioritizing putting a little bit of resources/planning to this). 

We (the adults) read. Sometimes we all just sit around and read. 

The kids have access to screens/tablets, but it’s not all the time. We limit it. None of them have cell phones yet (I’m actually not a fan of this last bit personally, as I think it’s limiting their social connections to not text with friends, but my exhusband is super controlling and refuses to support this). 

This has been going on their entire lives, and I don’t know if we hadn’t done this and suddenly introduced books when they were 5 if it would work.

It’s some well done journalism, and a story that’s still unfolding: only last year did the governor of Massachusetts announce an effort to finally rid the state of cueing theory based instruction. Efforts in other states aren’t too much further ahead, but are only targeted at teaching current children — there’s still a whole generation of kids who have been harmed by this instruction and do not like to read or struggle with it as a result. 

There has been a lot of blame recently placed on phones and other mobile devices (look at some of the other comments on this post), but I think cueing based reading instruction has been more damaging socially. It doesn’t just affect reading comprehension, but also spelling and writing as well. My sister is in undergrad, and comparing notes, the quality of student has definitely gone down. Many classes have online discussion board components, and students are unable to write anything meaningful to discuss. Dealing with people on Facebook Marketplace has also gotten worse: people are not able to read descriptions, and often cannot spell or message in complete sentences. The quality of forum posts has also gone down, as spaces are overwhelmed by folks who just cannot communicate effectively communicate through text.

What’s happened is terrible, but the only way it’s going to get better is through getting involved and advocating for science based reading instruction, not only for new students, but also for older students who were harmed by “whole language” instruction.","lpt4w1k"

This is one of those things that makes being middle aged a positive for me. The schools were better at teaching reading when I was a kid.  When I was in grammar school learning to read involved have readers plus a phonics workbook. So each day's reading lesson was the class working together to read from the reader, then we all pulled out our phonics workbooks and worked on the lessons there, and of course you were writing words down with a pencil to reinforce the lessons in your mind. My older siblings had phonics in school, so did my parents. 


When my oldest sibling's kids started school the schools were switching over from phonics to whole language and several of them struggled with learning to read, particularly the oldest. I suppose she helped her younger siblings out though. 


In grammar school we had a library and went there together as a class to check out books.


Since the school was near the public library we all went there as a class to get library cards in second grade. This sort of thing doesn't happen anymore.  Getting a library card used to be a rite of passage.

You can absolutely reach saturation with a sample size of 33 (in fact, in my research, I've generally hit saturation at around 10-15 interviews - if it takes more than that, your RQ is probably too broad). I think if the question is ""what have you noticed about students' ability to read"", you can get a very comprehensive view of the situation by asking 33 professors for their insights.

It's an unfortunate tendency of our quantitatively obsessed world that we see data in the form of numbers as better and more rigorous than qualitative data. But it isn't, it just isn't. High-quality qualitative research is just as rigorous as quantitative research (which can often hide its shoddiness behind a statistical sheen). In some ways, you can get a truer picture of the world from interviews because you are able to dig deeply into the precise nature of your subjects' experiences, rather than a generalized average of many peoples' experiences, which may be generally true but lacking in specificity.","lpt9udl"

Like we all just don't want to admit this for the most part, kids don't read because they have superior forms of entertainment, straight up. I think most millenials had that period in their lives where they read a lot as a kid, and then as soon as video games/the internet came along, they stopped reading. It's because you found a better form of entertainment, plain and simple.

This whole conversation sucks because it hyper focuses on the symptoms instead of the problem. The problem isn't that kids don't read or are on ipads all the time, it's that our entire society doesnt value critical thinking as a venerable trait. Anti-intellectualism is rampant and we belittle people who try to rise above that as smartasses and snobby over and over again. Nobody wants to be a fucking nerd. Kids not reading is a symptomn of that problem, not the cause of it.

I had that same issue where i read a ton as a kid then stopped once i got introduced to video games and the internet. The thing is i was able to actually still maintain the ability to critically engage in complex topics because my dad and some teachers/professors I liked specifically encouraged that. To my dad, it was better that i got a B+ and was an intelligent human being than if i got an A and didnt understand what I was learning. School has been more and more reduced to a function to achieve a score to (hopefully) achieve a higher salary, and kids all know this and are acting accordingly.

They also give you the opportunity for a head start on the Iliad specifically, gifting the book before school starts and telling you to read at least the first quarter by the first day of class. If you didn’t completely finish the reading for a particular subsequent class, you can likely survive discussion just fine and catch up next time or when studying for the test.

Of course, I wouldn't have been able to fit that when I studied Computer Science in college but I wasn't a lit student and that wasn't the focus of my major. But personally, workload as a CS student was around 50-60 hours a week with projects, higher than the workload I have now that I work. But the main reason why this was fun, is just that a big part of the workload I had as a student was tremendous fun.

The professor generally gives you the social context, etc. Also footnotes and introductions give that info. It's rare that you have to do independent research on the background. As for analysing and rereading and letting things sink in, you learn to be able to process things more quickly. After a bit you really don't need days to let every book sink in. You still can, of course, but not needing to take ages every book is an extremely useful skill.


Also, classes are generally on a topic, not just a book or two. In order to learn about the topic, you need to read a certain amount of things in a certain period of time. It's not normally feasible to have an informative class that gives you weeks per book.","lpt9air"

But its something that should be adjusted in lower education, so that when college presents students with more complex works that isn't just a novel, it doesn't come at a surprise to try to understand it, and if possible, allow the same medium to be presented in whatever format the student opts to learn with as long as if they can get the necessary info from that format.","lpw0ssk"

They could not handle it no matter how many accommodations I provided: late turn in, extended deadlines, partial in-class read aloud. And the school would not allow teachers to assign homework, so if we wanted to read full books, we had very little time for direct instruction about grammar, mechanics, and analysis, though I made as much as I could. 

Despite the negative outcome for me, my students left that year having read at least 3 novels from cover to cover, writing 2 essays and 1 narrative, all with actionable individual feedback. They had never written a real essay before either, and doubtful they’d read more than one full novel a year.

Then there really isn’t much reason for a kid to have one at all if they aren’t old enough to run around the neighborhood.

Get rid of the touch devices.  Schools need to stop normalizing it from a young age.  This is from the perspective of a software engineer that lives with an elementary school teacher:

any school that is “trying” but that hasn’t banned phones has effectively said “well we tried nothing effective and it didn’t work”.  

It’s like shoveling sand on a burning house while there is a fire truck right there.

—-

Not trying to be a dick, just bluntly honest.  It is for lack of trying.  It’s the smartphones. 

If I were caught having my flip phone in middle school or high school, I would have been sent to detention.  

Today schools act like it’s an obvious right for everyone from a kindergartener to a high school senior to have it available to them all day.  When it is clearly the reason for their lack of reading, writing, research, and reasoning skills.

Touch devices are only good for consuming content, mostly entertainment.  They are not computers.  The phone encourages laziness and an attitude where you don’t need to know anything because the phone can be used look it up.  But they lack the language skills to actually use Google effectively.  They don’t find out until a boss says they can’t speak to customers because their emails are atrocious.  And they will most likely think that’s mean.

I say this as a gigantic computer nerd.  Bring computers back to the classroom.  Get rid of the phones and tablets.  Teach kids to type and do actual research.  Hire teachers who actually know how to use a computer beyond placating kids with YouTube.

Schools let kids and parents pressure them into having toys in the classroom and calling it education.","lpt6mzn"

Maybe two, but I think we still only did one (edit: pretty sure it was two, because I remember doing two novels in sixth grade).

Unless it's a short novella, I've never been able to read a book in a week or in two. At least not if I have other obligations. I could do it if I were away camping for a week or something. I've always been embarrassed by how slowly I read books, and if I'm reading something, at some point I stop carrying it around with me and start only reading it at home so that nobody notices I've been carrying the exact same book around for over a month.

Maybe I'm part of a brainrot generation, but I could not imagine having to read a full-length book a week for a college course. If I were only taking _one_ course that semester and not working more than 20 hours a week at a job, sure, but since that course would probably be one of _four_ courses I'm enrolled in (in addition to a job)… no way.

Most undergrad honours seminars I knew of, in my department or in others, either focused on independent research to prepare students to write a thesis and didn't have their own course readings on top of that (because each student would be doing their own project and finding their own readings), or it would focus on a course topic instead of independent research, with the class having its own readings. In the latter case, students (such as people I knew taking honours in psychology) would be doing a single book the entire semester, analyzing it chapter-by-chapter.

In my class, we were expected to read a book a week, write a paper on each book, write a midterm paper and final paper, _while_ working on our own theses (and the only reason I took the course was because I wanted to do original research/do a thesis). My grade tanked in all three other courses I was in, even though those courses were no harder than the ones that I had up until then always gotten 'A's in. I've never had a course with a workload as high as that undergrad honours course even in my master's degree. Maybe my constitution was fragile, but I had no problem with finishing coursework before taking that class, and then struggled with getting started on stuff and turning things in ever since taking that class.","lpt4fnc"

I have friends who teach high school English, and they have students with second grade reading levels. I've got a few fifth graders with 1300L lexiles. 

The problem isnt just a total lack of academic achievement in absolute terms but the huge chasm of individual ability that exists in lots of this nation's classrooms. If 90% of your English II class is below grade level, 20% of your class has IEPs a mile long, and the majority of your class is barely reaching middle school reading ability, good luck teaching a novel to the class. 

There's no amount of differentiated instruction that will solve that problem. 

Then you combine this with how tied funding is to standardized testing is. They aren't tested on understanding novels. They're tested on decontextualized reading passages. So your literature class becomes a decontextualized reading passages class. Maybe, maybe, you can get a short story in there. Or maybe you can get them to read graphic novel Frankenstein. But good luck even getting administrative support. 

At my elementary school, students read 5-6 novels a year in class. 

At my friend's highschool, which is a different district in the same city, there are students enrolled in English I and English II *simultaneously* because they didn't pass English I the first time. And if that still doesn't work, they get put in a credit recovery class which is basically supervised computer lessons. The issue with that is that to pass, you have to pass all the tests, but the tests are all multiple choice, and you can have as many retakes as you want. Monkeys who can type with a random distribution can pass those credit recovery classes. 

The kids know this. It's *painful*. Nobody should be surprised when they don't put any effort in when they're treated like this. 

But the problem isn't going to be fixed unless we are willing to apply some creative solutions to how to educate a 17 year old who can barely read Beatrix Potter without humiliating them. 

For thousands of years, no human being has ever been educated on a diet of decontextualized reading passages. It's ludicrous to think that doing so is capable of producing an educated human being.

Reading is/was hard. As a little kid we seem to all love books. In grade school I started struggling with reading. I often liked the books our teacher would read to us, but struggled with assigned reading, and that generally continued through high school. 

It was not until college, and after graduation that I learned reading could be fun. The books I was forced to read rarely clicked with me, and I can still remember how much I struggled with Laura Ingles Wilder's books in 3rd grade. I could read them, but I often fell behind cause I hated what I was reading.

The only books I recall liking were To Kill A Mocking Bird and Fahrenheit 451. 

I still feel like I had some wonderful teachers, but none were able to foster a love of reading in me. Some of that might have been the fault of the curriculum, some is on my parents, and myself.","lpt8hri"

That shouldn't be shocking to you. Reading a book is not ""just like reading a sentence only longer,"" it's reading thousands of sentences that form a whole. It involves sustaining attention and exercising comprehension over hours, days or weeks instead of several seconds, following the thread of a narrative, remembering what you read last time, anticipating what may happen next and understanding the meaning of the whole of what you've read.

I hope you remember the sense of accomplishment you felt the first time you read a book with chapters, or a long book, or a book that you regarded as a novel instead of a picture book. You knew then that reading a book is a skill, you've just forgotten.","lpt8hri"

"lpw6dnp","Any_Advertising_543","2024-10-01 23:24:11 UTC","I will say that a lot of people in the comments aren’t appreciating that they’re being asked to read a whole lengthy book in one week. That’s not easy on top of other assignments from other classes, especially if the class isn’t something students are taking by choice, but it instead some sort of required class.

I went to UChicago after graduating from a rural school. In the first week of school, one of my core classes assigned Hobbes’ Leviathan. I had no experience reading philosophy (I am now pursuing my phd in philosophy fwiw lol) and I was incredibly overwhelmed. 

But I actually don’t think that’s what’s going on here. It seems more likely to me that the students aren’t prioritizing this particular class and don’t have the time to read whole books for it each week. I had to take a medieval history course and my professor assigned two whole books a week. Our discussion sections were terrible because nobody had read the books. I literally study medievals now (particularly Scotus and Aquinas) and I still never finished a single reading assignment for that class. It was a required course and I had other assignments that I thought were more important. 

I’d like to make one final point: asking students to read a whole book each week is likely *forcing* them to rush through it. The most rewarding undergrad class I took assigned 12 pages of Aristotle for the whole quarter. Each week we read a few paragraphs, but we gave the text the attention it deserves. I ended up falling in love with Aristotle, which quite literally changed the course of my life. 

TLDR — asking a student to read one book per week isn’t too demanding, but asking a student to read one book per week on top of their problem sets, labs, papers, and other reading assignments might be way too much.","lpt8hri"

The context for this is a movement, supported by common core, to have student learning timelines determine unit lengths (including moving on early if assessment indicates that they already learned all the goals and extending in they don't quite get it yet) as well as teach a broader variety of texts because students were graduating unable to parse any besides long form literary fiction (there's a certain irony that we traditionally only teach students how to read novels and write argument essays with no crossover). Both of these require focusing on shorter works, which allow finer and on-the-fly control of schedules and a broader variety of works. The pendulum turning against homework may also be a factor.

The exams stay the same. Some CA might be different but largely depends on modules.

Reality is that schools became way more competitive and score , test results , grades is all that matters to parents and their kids.

Getting a university degree became an absolute must (unless you have family in trades) so people who shouldn’t be in academia join it and universities oblige because it’s free money.

…So schools and universities adjust to it. Universities became more corpo friendly and are printing a lot of papers to satisfy socioeconomic demand for higher skilled labour force.

Universities also adapt to it by shifting graduate skills to higher levels. Back in the days a bachelor degree would provide you with basic research skill and solid base ground for being considered at the threshold of expertise.

Nowadays all those skills are pushed to masters and doctorate programs.

Objectively, my mother was out of her depth when it came to being a master of the subject matter at hand (like math) or social studies (she wasn’t particularly knowledgeable on the wider world). But one thing she did very well was encourage the ability of self teaching. Of discipline to be able to push through and self guide my own lessons. So by the time I did join public schooling (because she recognized the potential for her to serve her children very poorly if she tried to keep going), I was a straight A student, which I continued for a very long time. 

So while the approach worked for ME for a WHILE, I’m also not sure how much of it was my mother and how much of it was me who just legitimately enjoyed learning. I’d imagine a different personality or demeanor (a kid who loves sport and getting tough and tumble etc compared to me who’d rather be in reading or playing a game) would have floundered there

Some have never read to their kids at all, relying on audiobooks, podcasts, and YouTube videos for the bedtime routine. 

Reading to your child is more than a nice bonding activity, it helps create a positive relationship to reading, encourages kids to practice by reading aloud, and connects sounds to letter shapes.

Four course at a time is typical, if a course is three credits and the minimum ""full time"" load is twelve credits.

A much more reasonable estimate, considering that undergrads might actually sign up for five or six classes per semester, is 8 to 10 hours of homework per week.

For example,  I never particularly cared for To Kill a Mockingbird but I think it continues to be taught because 1)it's about a social issue and 2)there's a good movie version of it. IBID for Handmaid's Tale, 1984, Great Gatsby,  Animal Farm,  Shakespeare... 

I've taught literature at all levels (and have published several books) . When I did a demonstration lesson for a high school job, I was shocked to learn that they were still teaching OF MICE AND MEN. That's not even the best Steinbeck; it's chosen mainly because it's short and easy to read.  Unfortunately there's not much leeway for high school teachers to choose class readings; reading lists receive a lot of scrutiny at the high school level, and for the teacher it may be easier to teach books which aren't going to raise any eyebrows among parents or administration -- even if the texts aren't considered exciting or relevant by students.  

I  found Gatsby to be a snoozefest in high school, but I had a chance to read Fitzgerald's other works in graduate school; almost all of it was great and very readable.  

People complain about the literary canon -- but that was a mostly  ideological debate.  At the high school level it boils down to the cost of class sets and whether something is likely to appear on the AP exam. 

College profs probably have more freedom to choose reading lists, and the irony is that by that age, many students would have lost interest in doing serious reading. Perhaps one can only hope that these people rediscover reading in their later adult years at  book clubs or even audio books. 

Perhaps the whole idea of English classes need to be ditched entirely  and h.s. students should be required to join and participate in a student book club where they can choose their own reading lists.","lpuyvbn"

"lpv0p85","TheMadFlyentist","2024-10-01 19:34:44 UTC","That is certainly a factor, but doesn't appear to be the whole story. It has always been that case that some parents read to their kids while some don't. There are plenty of adults that successfully read books in school but never read for pleasure or had parents who read books.

It seems that screen time (and thus attention span) is a huge factor. The instant gratification and dopamine overload that most kids are exposed to these days is insanely toxic to their attention spans. There is no shortage of evidence on this.

The students this article is referencing don't just have trouble with comprehension, they are overwhelmed at the prospect of spending several hours in any given week actually sitting down and reading a book. It says in the article that the students are protesting the assignments in advance of even attempting to read any of the books. The mere *thought* of being required to read for that long in a week is abhorrent and foreign to them.

Luckily the newer generation of parents seems to be listening to the evidence and spending more hands-on time with their kids, so hopefully the ""iPad kid"" phenomenon is passing, but a lot of zoomer/gen-alpha kids now effectively have learning disabilities as a result of so much screen time during prime development years.","lptxz5x"

> In general, the aforementioned research on reading suggests that although there is some very modest evidence for shared environmental influences, genes are the primary force in shaping familial resemblance in reading skills.

There's a caveat that the research only applies for ""late elementary school age or older"" but that's what we're talking about here.

It's easy to confuse this correlation because the people that read to their children are the ones that are literate themselves, so it is entirely correct that the children that get read to are the ones that are most literate - but that's because their parents are literate and they inherit those genes!

Could you please edit your comment to make sure that people that come along don't get this preconception that ""it's not reading to them at home when they're little""? Thanks!

1) reading writing that goes beyond being just informative and that is not structured specifically to highlight the informative bits is its own skill that they never learned; they are used to reading texts that are designed to be gleaned to answer a straightforward question and then forgotten, or even just googling for the exact fact they want,     

2) they've been taught that it's more important to learn ""critical thinking"" and ""comprehension"" than ""content"" or ""facts"" because you can just google the latter, but the problem is that those ""just facts"" are both a foundation that you stick new facts on and the language that you have higher level discussions in; comprehension and critical thinking are not separable from what you are comprehending and thinking about, and 

3) if something is not easy for them, they immediately give up.  Giving up can take different forms--some immediately quit while others will push on and mindlessly read the whole paragraph even though they didn't understand the first sentence.  But there is no perseverance. When I was in college my major had rooms booked for multiple hours multiple days a week where at least one TA for the class would be present so you could just go and bang your head on the problem sets for hours; it was just understood that it would be hard.  Now I can't tell you the number of times that a probably twenty year old has told me that this problem is impossible, they've tried everything, when what they've tried is that they read it once and it didn't immediately solve itself.  I think there are at least two different things here--one is attention span/aversion to difficulty and being used to short-form and easy-to-digest entertainment, but I think the other is a sort of perfectionism, where if they can't do it perfectly they shut down and try not to draw attention to it instead of being willing to ask questions or struggle.","lptbonn"

Flow state is much harder to find now, as our brains have essentially been highjacked by gambling like attention grabbing smart phone features life infinite scroll and endless notifications.

They don't know what I teach or why I teach it because they don't have the experience or knowledge.  I have had only a couple of principals with a liberal arts background (seriously, two.  One English, one history.   I once worked at a school with *5 principals*) and they were the only ones who had any idea of what any teacher was doing.  Probably coincidentally, they also had the most in class experience. ","lpvhfmx"

Yes. I went to a school famous for working its students to death. The absolute worst time I had there was a semester when I had probably 3 or 4 mathy STEM courses, and an elective. For one of the STEM courses, the professor had a problem set that was due every single class, three times a week. It was basically just 6 days a week of studying. I have used next to nothing from any of those classes since graduating. I thought about that semester on a weekly basis for years. It was, no kidding, a completely transformative experience.

The workload is the lesson. A lot of people don't face any serious intellectual or time management challenges until they go to grad school or start working. Worse for them, they think they did, but they didn't. At some point, these Columbia students will be asked to do something. It will be the hardest thing some of their peers have done, in terms of workload or intellectual demands. It will be easier than what the Columbia students did when they were 19. It's not just a matter of stress or time management either. It also raises the bar for what it means to push yourself intellectually.

If I give an intern access to an information warehouse and ask them to gather some information from it, they need step-by-step instructions on how to find the info I've requested. Same with the new hires who are recent grads. I'm all for giving people grace while they learn a new platform and a new office culture, but it doesn't get any better even a year later, there is still zero impulse to write down instructions they've previously been given or even to intuitively guess at where a setting might be located within a platform. It's honestly disturbing!

The part you quoted is about a subset of the research the authors used, not their overall conclusion. 

>(I expect that the overall change is due to smartphones and the internet creating intense competition for short-term attention, but I don't have scientific sources for that.)

I suspect that plays some role, too, but as far as I know, the broader trends in literacy rates have a much higher correlation with changes in reading education than with the introduction of smartphones, etc. 

It really isn't a mystery why literacy rates in the US dropped. There was a widespread setback in reading education - started by some shoddy research and prolonged by a refusal to acknowledge better research once it came along - where teachers were taught methods that amount to teaching children how to fake reading comprehension instead of actually teaching them how to read.

Two, they have parebts who will just do things for them or demand they get everything handed to them from the school no matter how much it actually inhibited growth. Three, a lot of teachers, either through good intentions or burnout, just give students answers at the first sign of struggle.

A lot of studebts have a mindset that there is only ever one right answer, and if they can't get it right away, they'll never get it.

"lpuyjgi","flamingtoastjpn","2024-10-01 19:23:30 UTC","I taught/TA’d at one of the top engineering schools in the US and I’m going to add a few things to what you wrote

- as an extension of your 3rd point, students aren’t getting adequate individual attention to build the skills to work through problems. This starts with increased class sizes in primary school and doesn’t get better in college. When I taught calculus, I had a line out the door during office hours every week. There’s no way on earth to support 85 students with 3 hours of office hours. Probably half of those 85 needed 30-45 minutes of individual attention per week and they didn’t get it. That early hand holding is what’s supposed to help students develop their own strategies to bang their head against the wall productively. In my experience, when students give up immediately it’s because their knowledge is too far below the baseline required knowledge to make meaningful progress, and they can’t fix that without help.

- the focus on getting underrepresented groups to go to college is great for class mobility but reduces college readiness, and this has nasty knock on effects. In the past, a much larger percentage of students had parents/family/friends who were both vested in the their success and able to help. When a decent portion of students were able to “phone home” for help, that both increased tribal knowledge among the student body (who could then better rely on each other) and also reduced the load on instructional staff (who could then better assist students without those connections). Now everyone relies on instructional staff and students rely on each other less, with entirely unsurprising results.

TL;DR we need a lot more instructional staff or this isn’t going to get better","lptk8eq"

So, I'm not quite sure I understand what you're saying here. Are you suggesting students believe they can comprehend and critically analyze a text without understanding specific academic terms and technical language? That would contradict their capacity for comprehension, and by extension, the ability to apply any sort of critical analysis.

Comprehension requires an understanding of the content and facts presented, so I don't understand how one could follow without the other.

Pride and Prejudice is shorter and would be a lighter week, while Crime and Punishment is longer and would be a heavier week. But it’s heading towards an appropriate average (depending on the rest of syllabus of course).

I don’t judge anyone whose life is too crowded to fit in the “standard” amount of studying each week, but also that’s the design of college. 12 credit hours is “full time” and about 24-36 hours out of class studying each week on top of attending classes—a literal full time job.

Many extremely bright children do get missed. Nobody notices they can't read because they rely upon memory and context cues. The example above is someone who's gone to great lengths to accomodate their difficulties by intuitively seeking out other mediums to gain knowledge. This ability usually hits a ceiling - for some people it is early primary school school and others it's university. There's a continuum in terms of severity and where the difficulties lie.

I'm just really passionate about this topic - it isn't about skating by. Some people claw their way in.

How could a teacher go into complex themes and provide quality questions if every kid is reading a different book?

In the same vein, we teach mixed numbers to kids at age 8 or so, why? They are only for baking. If you write 1 1/2 in any other context, it means 1 x 1/2 because that's how algebra works. Then they show up in college not knowing what 3/2 is.

I got the reputation of being very knowledgeable quite fast. I learned a lot by hart and the things I didn't know, I know where to find.

So sometimes it was faster for my coworkers to come to me, explain their problems and I would give a solution then looking it up. And I loved to help people, especially the new ones. If it where tough questions I would help, but if the solution was easy I told them where to find the information and let them do it. For the most times people 25+ approach me 1-2 times with similar questions before learning by them self.

But every year in the beginning of summer after schools closed we had 15-25 new kids age 19 come and work for us. They got two weeks orientation and training then 2 weeks on the phone with help then they were on their own. (this changed to 4 weeks with help and two tiers) they had to pass the first tier before getting the second tier).

Most new know that they could come to me for help, and I gladly helped for I wanted for them to learn. But when they aproched me with the same question with the same simple answer, I first showed where to find the information and then stopped helping and only tell to look it up then self. Most who didn't stayed past 3 month stared to ask other people instead as it was easier then to look up the information themselves.

I had a term I used and told them in a ""inpromto meeting"" if they didn't stop asking they would never learn and they would always have trouble to keep another then the most basic jobs.","lpvx5iu"

"lpvvhfx","ColumbineJellyfish","2024-10-01 22:18:20 UTC","I think this is nice to get a small child to enjoy reading, but it's a very limiting technique.

A lot of literary devices are not transferable to visual mediums, and a bunch of tricks which can be employed in a play or a movie do not make sense when translated to a book. Plenty of books have very little or very confused visual aspects to them, trying to picture them in your head like a play or a movie rather than focusing on the actual words being written would make it significantly difficult to understand or enjoy them.

If you go on /r/writing, you'll see that one of the major issues aspiring writers have is treating books as if they are movies, and getting confused because they're struggling to use visual devices instead of literary devices.

Not to say don't do it because you're reading for your own enjoyment, but kids in school are supposed to be learning language arts, and I think this would interfere with that.

Ultimately I think there's 2 separate issues: (a) kids need to learn that reading is fun and do it for pleasure, and become faster readers, and (b) kids need to learn that school is not designed to entertain them, and it's normal for humans not to always be having fun.

I'm a Dutch book nerd, and can compare between language courses I had in high school. For Dutch and English we had to read whole books in lit class besides the standard testing texts in the language classes. For German we only had the standardized testing like you describe it. I grew up with vacations in Germany and even at some point as a teenager got through my vacation books too fast, and read German YA books my dad got me, so it's not like I wasn't inclined to read German books. Still, looking back, that died down. While I still read English and Dutch and saw the snippets of standard testing in those languages as inspiration to look up books and read them, I never read anything in German after that vacation. I was too busy snippet-ing, and it somehow didn't occur to me to try German books, or that that language would have complete books too.

So if I want to teach a novel, I can't have the kids read a chapter for homework and do activities around it in class. Now I have to spend of all class time reading the chapter and then the next day doing activities with it. So now novels take twice as much time or longer to teach in class.

The two skills do not completely overlap. 

When I was a senior in high school (way back in the 1990s) we had AP English split into two different ""tracks."" You could take AP English Literature or AP English Language. The assumption was that if you took the Literature course that the student could take both the Literature and Language tests without a problem. The Literature test focused on literature, of course, but the Language test had a greater emphasis on short form non-fiction.

Due to scheduling conflicts I switched from the Literature class to the Language class mid-year. After both tests several students gathered in the teacher's classroom to talk about it. This was the first year that both classes, and therefore both tests, had been given at my school. The Literature students who took both tests found the Language test to be a bit more difficult as they had studied very little non-fiction throughout the year. I found the two tests more or less equal in difficulty.

And then to actually do it a couple times to figure out how to arrange their legs etc.

Maybe one or two per session would do it. All the others just wouldn't listen or pay attention or persevere. In a group of 5-10 of them it was easier to just put the little guys back on their feet for them. 

The little vests they wore had handles and everything to make it so much easier. All my fellow instructors moved to picking them up so the rest of the group could continue down the slope.

I would've never built problem solving skills and resilience solely through school. 

In contrast, when I participated in math contests I would often spend hours proving/solving a single problem. The tool set was wider, and there were multiple intermediary steps to find and pursue before being presented with a solution. I became comfortable with brainstorming, filtering, testing promising paths, then repeating the process over and over again. In doing so, I improved my intuition and problem solving. However, I only became involved because my parents went out of their way to find me challenges.

I remember an exam I once took that asked for my opinion, but my opinion was incorrect because it wasn’t grounded in comprehension of the significance of the work I was critiquing at the time. It was one of the first times that I had been asked for my opinion as opposed to a more blatant “yes/no” question. Now that I look back on it, I understand why I was incorrect, but I hadn’t developed the ability to discern what was actually being asked at the time of the exam because I was so used to the idea of a single correct answer that I didn’t understand my opinion needed to be supported in a specific way.

"lpvogp0","mg132","2024-10-01 21:38:18 UTC","What I (and friends in a few other disciplines) have experienced is that a lot of students we encounter seem to think that there is a bright line between advance factual knowledge and being able to take a piece of written material and answer comprehension or critical thinking questions or use it to pose and solve a problem, as if the latter are skills that are not benefited by (and sometimes almost entirely predicated on) already having context.  (I suspect this comes from their exposure to a certain style of ""reading comprehension"" test prep materials and tests.)  A different but somewhat related issue also seems to pop up when students are expected to remember things from much earlier in texts that are longer than anything they've encountered before; many just don't want to do it or are not equipped to.  

I find that the students I encounter even in upper div science classes seem to think that ""facts"" questions are completely distinct from ""experiments"" questions or ""problems.""  In their experience how factual knowledge works is that you either come into the test with certain facts memorized and then flush them as soon as the test is over because memorizing is silly, we have google now, or you're given a short text to read which contains everything you need to know in easy-to-glean fashion with little background knowledge required (and also you flush everything as soon as the test is over or you're done discussing the passage).  The idea that actually the reason I've assigned them this content in this order is that it is meant to be learned in a context and retained so that they can build on it and use it as a language to talk about more difficult and complex problems seems to elude many of them, even as they bemoan the types of classes that they regard as memorization-heavy or the types of pset problems they regard as plug-and-chug and claim that they want more interesting problems that require critical thinking and not just memorization.  

But if I give them one of those more interesting problems, they bounce right off of it, in part because they deride the factual knowledge needed to understand the ""language"" the problem is written in  and/or the ""plug-and-chug"" approach to making some of the nitty-gritty steps of the problem automatic to them to free up space to think about the big picture.  They think that being expected to retain and build on factual knowledge or relatively basic math is boring and anyways kind of stupid because Google exists, but ultimately this hamstrings them by making complex problems and longer texts much harder than they need to be.  It is a lot harder to read either a novel or a word problem when you have to constantly stop and look up words/events/concepts/equations/etc. you were expected to already have internalized as background knowledge or that you read about 60 pages ago but flushed because your high school never tested you on passages longer than three paragraphs or problems longer than a sentence.

 I even pointed out he could have a different book to read at bedtime that he didn't have to journal on but no joy.  I'd still read to him and I'd still continuously offer new or interesting things but it would be almost a decade before he'd start reading books for enjoyment again.  Happily he did continue to read comic books - he didn't think it counted as reading but I did.   As Erma Bombeck once said ""words in a row"".

In 1st & 2nd grade it was just a timekeeping sheet that listed the title and the amount read each day, signed off on by the parents.  That was fine with him.

when you describe a neurotypical kid having \\*some\\* of the same characteristics as an ADHD kid...  would similar efforts assist them both?  Outside of medication, because the difference in how brains function on stimulants would mean it wouldn't really help the ""normal"" kids...

I'm currently in the middle of re-doing my son's IEP.  He's medicated...  and I have him experiment a lot with his meds to find just the right dose...  but even after that he needs other ""interventions"" in class to be successful.

I've always thought that most of the things he needs, just about all students would benefit from (they just don't ""need"" them, they can get by without them, but would they do even better with them?)  Like one of his teachers, when I asked how she structured her class for standardized testing, said she always breaks the tests into 20 min segments, and gives a Move Break in between them!  That would have been similar to what we asked for for our kiddo, but she found it worked best if she gave all her kids that environment.

When I see these articles about ""kids these days"" and it's essentially describing ADHD symptoms it is both depressing (because apparently these qualities will be the downfall of society, and it makes me laugh that people pretend ADHD isn't that big of a deal, but apparently when every kid acts that way we won't survive as a species...) and also weird to me, because they're claiming it comes from too much screen time, and not enough rigor from teachers, and parents not caring, and the gods only know what else...  because it's like, well...  if those things are \\*really\\* causing these dopamine ""hits"" and whatever else, then studying that should have interesting relationships, and possibly insight into or relationships with, the dopamine response in an ADHD brain.  Even if it just highlights the differences (like how ""typical"" brains react in an opposite manner to ADHD brains when given stimulants) it might still be enlightening.

I think I remember maybe one lesson on the UK civil war, and that's interesting, but only in the things I've learned outside of school.


I remember a little about WW1, but mainly just lead up and the treaty of Versailles and the impact on Germany economically, but nothing about how Germany turned around their economy after WW1.


I learnt a few bits and pieces about the war itself, but a lot of that was from English classes as it pertained to poetry and the surrounding circumstances (I'm an avid reader and they were good textbooks, so they had details around the circumstances of the poetry being written).


I don't remember what I learned in school about WW2. To be fair, I probably learned at least a little about it, but I learned a fair bit through other sources (Documentaries, Horrible Histories books, etc...).


I know I also learned a few bits about Egypt early on, and the invention of agriculture, but not very much about the empire as a whole, or how it 'ended'.


Oh, and there's the classic war of 1066, although unfortunately I can't precisely remember Williams claim to the Throne, and I don't know what actually happened on a practical level after the battle of Hastings - did he just rock up to London and tell everyone he's king?


There's other bits besides, and some of these lessons have kind of stuck, but if nothing else, a lot my lessons weren't interesting enough for me to remember the details, or we didn't progress through point to point.




I'm not trying to be pedantic or ""The only history that's relevant is war stuff"". I just feel like a lot of what I learned was little factoids, as opposed to things that made me more knowledgeable.


Like, Egypt invented agriculture. Ok. What happened everywhere else. How did that spread, what impact did it have for the Egyptians, what was happening before then?

My advice: Pick one of the books you’ve put down over the past year, pick up where you left off, and force yourself to finish it.

"lw61ysg","Maleficent-Garage-66","2024-11-08 23:48:27 UTC","Did some tutoring for a math center part time for a while, not a mathematician though.  My education is a BS in Chemistry (almost a minor in Physics) and an MS in Data Analytics  And I definitely can sympathize with what you're describing.  Ran into a brick wall explaining how calculator's aren't an arbiter of mathematical truth (and that floating numbers have their caveats).  There is an absolute break down on people understanding what they're computing (and just basic mathematical reasoning) and cases of chronic decimalitis.

I about broke people forcing and requiring answers be written in exact form (ie 1 + sqrt(3), 2/3\\*pi, and etc).  A few of the bright ones got some time to see the proof of the irrationality of sqrt(2) or sqrt(3) and etc from me when discussing why what their calculator spits out is not the sqrt(2) (but rather a number arbitrarily close to it).  I had one poor student who's world view was a bit broken when I kept explaining that 3.14 is not pi (no matter what their teacher insisted).

I probably frustrated a lot of people with geometry because rather than giving them a property or formula they'd be forced to sit down with me and work together to derive it and sketch out a proof.  Grading people's proofs though hurt there...the two column format they shove down their throat has them more focused on reciting names of properties and theorems than learning to make the argument.  So I would get disjointed non-arguments that didn't demonstrate the required (or that were outright fallacious).

Got some really good moments with the kids since we weren't beholden to the curriculum and got to do a lot of good.  Had a kid that came in and couldn't do polynomial long division.  We talked about what division was (I built up from a repeated subtraction type approach).  We reasoned through the standard algorithm and used it for some simple numbers.  Then I made them tell me the steps and then do them for the homework.  They managed to do polynomial division without ever being walked through it by me.  As soon as what times x gives x\\^3 left my mouth they were off to the races after having deep dived normal division.  The issue wasn't the polynomial long division, the issue was they had never understood the concepts behind division until we did that deep dive.  We're getting to the point where we're training people in button pushing instead of reasoning and numeracy.","lpte9bt"

She encouraged me to write down the info and told me that next time this came up, do my best to use the resource library and then come to her with the answer that I thought was right and she would confirm for me. She was always available to confirm whether I was getting the right answer, but didn’t have to deal with me asking the same question over and over. 
  
I loved that because she knew what she was doing: I was learning how to use the resources but also got more comfortable and confident with the info that way. Pretty soon I was only coming to her with “real” questions. I’m so grateful that she sat me down that day because ever since I’ve tried to practice finding the info myself before asking.

My high-ability students can read unaltered text and build on their current skills, discuss what they took away from the reading, what they found interesting or intriguing, etc. Those kids are generally good at leading themselves with minimal guidance.

It’s an analogy to the scaffolds constructions workers put up while they’re building a wall, which is essential during construction but won’t be there when the building is complete.

Let's take an in-class discussion. Kids have read an article, and you want them to discuss the author's message and how they're using language techniques to be persuasive and engaging. An unscaffolded technique is to just say, ""discuss the article"". Scaffolds in this context might be giving the kids a list of relevant higher-level vocabulary terms with definitions included, then telling them they have to use one term in their answer. You're giving the support with vocabulary, so they have to think more about sentence structure. 

An alternative scaffold might be sentence frames. This is where you give fill-in-the-blank sections that the kids use. It lets them focus on coming up with ideas when they might not otherwise be sure how to put them into words. An example would be, 

""I believe the author wants us to think ___ about ____. We see this in paragraph number __ where they write,"" ____"". The word/phrase "" ___"" stands out because ____.","lpui88c"

To be clear, both accusations were unjust, and Socrates probably would have lived if he kept to the cultural norms expected of him at trial, but he insisted on using that opportunity to argue he ought to be crowned and fed like an Olympic victor. 


But it's frankly wild to see someone suggesting ""the youth"" put a man to death. In what society do the young wield political power?

------

The bit about ""Socrates bitching about the youth"" is probably referring to his position on how the invention of writing was turning student's minds to mush because they no longer had to remember anything, which is effectively today's Google argument. 

But, generally, he wasn't even critical of the young. If anything, he felt they had a right to speak up - leading to charges that he was teaching them to disobey their parents, to do what Aristophanes shows in the Clouds of making the worse argument win out over the better argument through clever sophistry.","lpuxo99"

5% came from the bottom 20%.

I don't think the high-level kids felt that bothered, though. They had a document to follow with guided questions, and they would write down the answers from their peer discussions. The work I gave them was mostly about getting more comfortable reading, discussing, and analyzing the passages and then sharing the critical points of the readings with the rest of the class.

Both are interpersonal romance dramas capped with murders and other exciting stuff, it sounds like that's what appeals to their interests... but yes Shakespeare is maybe better experienced as a play since it's actually... a play. I do think I got a lot more out of reading it than watching it, because I would struggle to get most of the puns and wordplay while it's being acted out. Then again maybe doing it in a classroom where people speak slower and it's closer to the ""stage"" is better.

>I was talking specifically about students, and reading books for class - which are usually selected for their themes and their appeal as being important in some way; rather than because students would find them interesting.

Yeah and what I'm saying is I don't think it's good for students to learn to handle reading things they are not interested by trying to make them into a play/movie. What happens when it's time for them to read more advanced books, or essays, or other stuff that doesn't translate to visual media?

It works to get small children or illiterate people reading ""by any means necessary"".

But I clearly remember plenty of the books we read even in high school were selected for their literary devices, which don't transfer to a visual medium. If I was trying to think of the book as a movie, it would interfere with what I'm supposed to be doing, which is analyzing its' actual written words.

Ultimately I think the answer is (a) kids need to become fast readers, by any means necessary, at a young age, and (b) they need to learn and accept that some parts of life are not fun, they still need to be done, and it's not a bad thing that you're not feeling entertained.

Plus I never understood the need for homework. We spent hours every day in school going over the material. If you really needed a refresher before the test, then either pop out your notes or read the textbook for an hour every day leading up to the test.

Like, I literally went into the ACT completely blind and scored a 31.

My high school gave it for free and required every student in their junior or senior year, I forget which, to take it.

I completely forgot about it and went into it completely blind. Walking into school that day I had no clue we were taking the ACT because I'd forgotten about it. Still got a 31 on it though.

But yeah. I'd go into class getting a 90 -100 on every test, even on my 100 question comprehensive biology final my freshman year in high school. But my grades were always in the B or C range simply because of homework.

I can sit there, not take _**any**_ notes, sometimes while reading a book all throughout the class period, and I'd _**still**_ get an A on every test you threw at me.

You claimed that reading a book is not a skill, and said that no one has to be taught how to read a newspaper, and no one teaches you how to read a book start to finish. You do have to explicitly teach many children what a chapter is, and how to know a new chapter has started and an old one ended, how to recognize books that are a novel versus books where every chapter is a different story, where a good place to pause reading for the day is, how to remind yourself of what happened the last time you read, how to go back and check details you might have missed. All of this is explicitly taught. You do in fact have to explicitly teach kids how a newspaper works, and why the story doesn’t fit on this page, and how to know where to finish a story, and what a headline is, and what a caption is, and how it is organized. That’s aside from the fact that the stamina required for reading a book is something that has to be taught and deliberately practiced.  

As I tried to explain to you, you are obviously privileged and it was obviously normalized to you growing up. I don’t know if you’re trying to be dense on purpose or if you’re just *that* ignorant? That’s why you don’t understand that these things are explicitly taught. Many kids I teach do not have a book in the house at all. If they do, it’s a children’s book. Their parents do not read.

It makes sense to take the classes as pass/fail, and to give it a serious effort taking into account how time has to be divided up. A student who barely meets the passing threshold but actually learned through sincere effort how to properly read and engage with media is getting a lot more out of the class than a student who got a higher grade with less effort, focused on learning the right answers and ignoring the process. That's what I'm saying, is it's really worthwhile to engage with the work even if that means you either lack the capacity or time to excel at it.

 It's interesting . I never recall my parents really ""helping"" me the way we do. Granted, I'm not that old (40), so it's pretty wild things have changed so fast.

Now, he can read. However, he doesn't fully comprehend it because he gets thrown off by stylized pros and dialog. He also can't detect what is behind the plain meaning, if that makes sense. That's what baffles me a bit. I see why teachers struggle in the environment you're describing. You aren't given the freedom to do what is best. Frankly, it's a travesty and is deeply concerning.

But do you really think the subjects of the article, adults who have explicitly chosen to study literature, don’t know how to do things like turn pages or recognise chapters? You are talking extremely basic mechanical skills taught to really young children. It is not what the article or the discussion is about. 

What it is about is that college age adults who have explicitly decided to study literature do not have the capacity to read books to completion. No amount of effort is going to “teach” them how to do that. Because that is not a question of skills it is a question of preference. Personality. Enjoyment.

The simple answer is that these are not readers. They are perhaps kids who have been deceived by the education system into treating literature as an exercise in passing exams. Students who have attend school, done the homework and been taught the answers. Read the Spark Notes. Such students have no place in anything beyond a general university level course.

Because some people are readers. People who like to read. Who habitually read. And some people are not. And that’s fine. It makes no judgement about ability, skills or intelligence to say so. It is simply that some people like reading and some people do not. And the real sad truth of things here is that the former are being encouraged to pursue higher level study of literature when they should not be. Studying literature you meet this kinds of students at every level. They struggle at every new level. They have to learn what to readers is obvious. They have to work too hard to do something that shouldn’t be that hard. They should be taking their joyless ability to read and pass exams and applying it to a subject suited to those, lol, skills.

Not getting all the way through the reading because more important work took up the time you would use to finish the reading is one thing. Choosing not to do the reading and attempting to fake it with spark notes is a different thing. Option A at least forces you to engage with the work to some extent, even if you don't know all the plot (which is not why books get assigned). Option B might let you be able to talk about the plot, but robs you of the ability to practice analyzing the text for yourself. Both are examples of prioritizing more important work and will probably result in a worse grade, but option A is just better, even if it results from the same investment of time.

If you simply can't even attempt the coursework, you're taking a courseload that isn't sustainable and you should be taking fewer courses this semester. There are some degrees with really heavy courseload every semester, and those course loads are what pass/fail is for. Take courses outside of the major as pass/fail and make sure you allocate enough time to do enough of the work to pass, but you should still be engaging with the work, even if you can't get through all of it, rather than trying to fake it.

Furthermore, the fact that people in the past could do something doesn't mean people now can. Skills can fall out of use and become less practiced (whether that's a good or bad thing is a topic for another time). The same article that's creating this discussion (which you probably didn't read) acknowledges this possibility:

> Lit Hum often requires students to read a book, sometimes a very long and dense one, in just a week or two. But the student told Dames that, at her public high school, she had never been required to read an entire book. She had been assigned excerpts, poetry, and news articles, but not a single book cover to cover.

> “My jaw dropped,” Dames told me. The anecdote helped explain the change he was seeing in his students: It’s not that they don’t want to do the reading. It’s that they don’t know how. Middle and high schools have stopped asking them to.

To be fair, this is also anecdotal evidence. The student in question could've been lying, or maybe their experience is unusual. But it is *possible* that most students now can't read a full novel in one to two weeks.

What the other person is arguing is as clear as the summer sky. I'm not sure how to simplify it further for you. This is their comment:

> Modern printings of the Iliad are roughly 500 pages, give or take. The average reading pace for most people is ~2 minutes per page. So, it would take 16+ hours in total to read a book that length.

> An hour a week is only 7 hours.

URL: `https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ftnbp2/comment/lpt4kms/`

If someone reads for an hour a day, that's seven hours per week or 14 hours per two weeks. If reading *The Iliad* requires 16 hours per week (which it may not), then guess what? Most modern students would not be able to finish it by reading one hour per day for two weeks. It doesn't even matter whether the other person gave an accurate reading rate. They believe it's accurate, so they also believe most students can't finish *The Iliad* in one to two weeks.

The paragraph above was another attempt by me to explain to you what someone else is saying. It's a bit funny to call someone's argument ""unhinged"" when you can't even understand it.

Please name the article and author from where you learned that the average reading pace is ""40 pages per hour"". (If you paste a URL into your comment without a code block, the spam filter may delete it.) The first search result I found says the average reading pace for a college student is 250 words per minute or 20 pages per hour (Scholar Within, n.d., ""Average Reading Speed by Age and Grade Level""). Brysbaert (2019) claims it to be 238 words per minute (""How many words do we read per minute? A review and meta-analysis of reading rate"").

> Once again, I demonstrated why the assignment could be done reading an hour a day. AND THE MAIN POINT YOU SEEM INCAPABLE OF GRASPING: PEOPLE HAVE READ THESE SAME BOOKS FOR THE SAME ASSIGNMENTS FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND MANAGED FINE. Thus, the argument that they're being asked to read too quickly for comprehension holds no water.

You tried to demonstrate, but you failed. You've also failed to consider that maybe (and I do mean ""maybe"") college students now have a *lower* reading level than college students of the past.
