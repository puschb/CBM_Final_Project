Which tells me ergodic literature is an intellectual exercise imposed on exiting texts ex post facto, in the hope to influence future text (well, my limited experience of academics tells me it's actually in the hope to appear clever in the moment).

So, maybe? For me, the most useful part of your comment: you got 15% of the way in and didn't like it. Personally, I like puzzles. Personally, I like stories made of words.

"ltikcxy","SamSzmith","2024-10-24 14:14:33 UTC","For me it was never spooky, the book is less about the house and more of an experimental book where there are multiple layers of stories. One of the House itself which is a very small part of the book, one about the owner of the house who makes documentaries which may or may not actually be real, and one about the narrator who finds a book that talks about the two things above and his life.

I honestly though it was pretty boring.","ltgporw"

"ltgs43u","billtrociti","2024-10-24 04:58:07 UTC","A lot of the book is about stories within stories, so there are a few different characters who are only tangentially related to the titular “House.”  My favorite parts are the ones that follow the storyline about the characters who live in the house (I think a lot of other people feel the same).  The clever story within stories was interesting but ultimately I didn’t really care much for it and if I were to re-read the book, would probably skip some of it.  It does help to build tension and mystery though, though.

The spookiness of those parts come more from a big, looming sense of dread.  The dark unknown of big, impossible spaces that shouldn’t exist, and the threat of unseen horrors that lurk there.  It’s not a gory, violent book, but a slow existential creeping.","ltgporw"

A lot of IJ (and the endnotes!) is really funny or absurdist, but I don’t think Wallace is trolling.

Trying not to sound pretentious here but the whole point of the book is that it is a non-traditional take on the psycological horror genre.  It presents itself as an essay analysing a simple story about a creepy house with a simple story bookending how the essay was found.  but if all you care about was the creepy house story then you aren't really ""getting"" the story at all.  All the parts make up the whole.  I am not going to pretend to understand everything that happend, ""Deep reading"" isn't really my thing but I loved the book as a whole.

It is a book about a labyrinth, that is a labyrinth itself.  If you ignore the footnotes and focus only on the story the you are essentially sitting on a cherry picker looking down at the labytrinth from above and saying ""nah, too complicated"" then calling it overrated having not actually ""Experienced"" it.

It's a pretty suspenseful romp and I found the metatextual disgressions pretty entertaining. 

I've read Heidegger and tried to read Derrida, but apart from the obvious nod towards Derrida's metatextuality I didn't find the book to engage very deeply with any of their philosophies.

"lthsozp","typish","2024-10-24 11:13:03 UTC","I understand that the book is a labyrinth, and that Johnny's notes are essential parts of the thing. I enjoyed that.

But I also didn't really see the point, for instance, of the hundreds of zampano's notes that merely cite nonexistent literature. Do they have intrinsic meaning besides making it look even more like a scholarly work? Seriously asking: it didn't look like that to me, but they might well do.

All in all, I also don't know that I see very tight relationship of meanings between all the parts, but I do see people saying a second read shows a lot more. It might, but I don't know if I have it in me to go through it a second time :)","lthdfdc"
"lthdxlf","PM_BRAIN_WORMS","2024-10-24 08:43:58 UTC","I have never in my life called the book overcomplicated or overrated. And what’s so insufficient about words like “get” and “experience” anyway?","lthdfdc"

And it's not like, a backlash to it being over hyped on this subeddit, people show up here wanting to put down HoL. 90% of posts about it are negative, the other 10% asking if it's too hard to read. It's made me like this subreddit a bit less to be honest.","lthdfdc"
"ltj4ugz","Deleted","2024-10-24 15:59:34 UTC","Eh, I’d classify those more as easter eggs than anything essential to understanding the full story. It’s neat when you notice them, but you can enjoy the book just as well if you don’t notice. They are not like Truant’s notes which are fundamental to digesting the story.","ltix0z9"
"ltjtits","Accurate_Matter822","2024-10-24 18:01:28 UTC","Sounds like the book just wasn’t for you, which it did warn you right at the beginning: “this is not for you.” Just know that references to philosophers are not mere references, they act (ironically enough) like the center of the text, the key to unlocking the esoteric meaning beneath the surface.","ltjs766"

"lticbnk","MMSTINGRAY","2024-10-24 13:28:57 UTC","I think you can argue they are integral to the book overall without being in themselves important to any plot. People say 'trim the fat' but it's not a screenplay, and the fat on meat adds to the flavour. Infinite Jest wouldn't be Infinite Jest if it was edited down into a much tighter story. 

So I think you can say it's not important to the story but still recognise it adds to the book. Like you say you still loved all the bits that weren't plot integral. Also when it comes to themes and tone I think all the little subtle things add up a lot more, you might not affect the plot by cutting them but you might lose some of the charm.","lth4q2n"

"lthz8qv","Sudden_Hovercraft_56","2024-10-24 12:03:40 UTC","It's another layer of the labrynth.  you have made the turn by reading the footnote.  do you turn back and keep going down the obvious path or do you turn again by seeing if the source quoted is real.  If it isn't real, what's the meaning behind it?  If it is real, do you go further down that path and read the whole source knowing you will have to turn back and get back to the main path.  If you do, suddenly the labrynth has been brought out of the pages and is now building itself in real life....

Personally, I didn't follow up on any of the Zampano cited sources.  My personal enjoyment of the material stays strictly within the pages of the book itself, but others love that sort of stuff.  It appeals to those that love watching ""The <insert popular media> iceberg explained, how deep does it go"" type of videos and really digging deep into lore.","lthsozp"
"lthyne0","SuitableDragonfly","2024-10-24 11:59:16 UTC","I definitely haven't gone through it in enough detail, but there are 100% all kinds of secret codes scattered throughout those strange footnotes. I've seen some of them spelled out on forums, and I'm sure there must be others. There is a weirdly particular index in the back, for example, which indexes words which aren't normally indexed, and faithfully indexes things that appear to be typos in the running text, but definitely does not index every word in the book. ","lthsozp"
