For the next three days, terrestrial gravity alone ensures that the tomato pulp deposits its liquor in the bowl, filtered through the clean linen drop by drop. That’s how one extracts the essential flavour – the very soul of the fruit. Then add some salt, a few grains of sugar and a dozen threads of saffron – precisely a dozen, mark you! – and simmer over a low flame for one whole day. The broth must never boil, or it will dissipate the soul of the tomato and taste of nothing at all. That’s the only way to obtain this orange shade.’ (p. 27)""",""

I can’t remember the taste otherwise, I was very young (6, 7?) and I would not have been able to identify caramel or toffee then, it was probably mostly maple syrupy?? 

I just knew it was a cool thing to do with my mom, that my little sister was too little to help, so it was just my mom and I making it & just the two of us going outside in the snow. My mom was never a reader, and even then I truly appreciated that she was supporting me by bringing to life something from a book I loved, I couldn’t have said it like that back then, but she made me feel really special by doing that for me.
