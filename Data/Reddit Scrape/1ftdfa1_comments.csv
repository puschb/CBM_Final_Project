"lprgcat","Merle8888","2024-10-01 03:53:34 UTC","Well, I look at it slightly differently. There are so many thousands of books out there clamoring for attention, thousands more published every year, and I read at most 100 a year. So, I aim to read the books I think I’m most likely to appreciate. Past experiences with an author (good or bad) are certainly data points in making those decisions, as are blurbs, reviews, and the quality of the opening pages of the book. 

So the answer is really that it depends. If I read a book, or just a few pages, from an author and conclude they are a poor writer full of cliches, I’m not likely to look at any of their other books (but then, I might if they seriously level up as an author and also have future books that sound up my alley). If I get tired of an author for overusing the same characters and tropes, same. But it’s more that there will always be more promising things to read than returning to that dry well, as opposed to making an affirmative decision to read nothing more by an author. We’re not in a relationship, we don’t need to break up. ",""

I love the book ""Dust"" by Charles Pellegrino (1998) So much that I actually bought a copy (library person here). An acquaintance and I often exchanged books. She gave me one by Patterson around 2010. I was shocked by how startlingly similar it was to ""Dust"". Our next exchange I gave her ""Dust"". When the next exchange happened she explained her shock at how it was basically the same book with different names and a few other minor changes, verifying that I was not overreacting.

If I do make it through a whole book that I dislike (usually end up hate reading the last third of it) I almost certainly won't try another book by the same author. Will never ever read anything by Richard Powers after absolutely hating The Overstory. 

However - I really really disliked Normal People by Sally Rooney, but I do have Beautiful World Where Are You on my TBR stack on the recommendation of a good friend (who also didn't like Normal People). Sooo it's not a hard and fast rule, but in general I won't continue to try to read an author I didn't like previously - life is too short. 

However, if it's the other way around, where I love one or two books by an author and then nothing else lands, I will give up for good after about two books. Isabel Allende was like this for me - I loved House of the Spirits, but then it was like everything else she wrote was basically a different version of the House of the Spirits - I felt like she had one story in her and I'd read the best version first and didn't feel like I had to keep trying.",""

"lpr5g4z","arbor597","2024-10-01 02:37:38 UTC","People have been absolutely raving about Ryan Cahill’s “The Bound and the Broken” series. I read the first book and thought, “okay, this was his first try and he’s self-published.” and tried to ignore the incredibly poor writing, using his inspirations directly (more on this in a sec), and basically just rewriting “Eragon” in his own new way. 

His inspirations are crystal clearly John Gwynn’s “The Faithful and the Fallen” series, “Eragon” by Paolini, and surprisingly Bethesda’s “Skyrim”. He uses the same names, plot lines, and even notable places (Whiterun? Cmon man.) in his books. 

I found the first book incredibly weak, but a solid attempt. The second book was unbearable. I found it to be dull, near-plagiarism, and it was quite evident he was self-published. 

To answer your question: I give it two books before I call it quits. The first book might just be a learning curve as the author finds his/her rhythm, so I always give them a second chance with the second book. Unfortunately, I found the second book in this series to be weaker than the first. Very, very disappointing.

I also am not impressed by if a book is popular, or not.  I generally won't give an author much more of my attention. Like with The Wheel of Time series, for example. The very first book was good, I enjoyed it. The second book was very boring to me, and dragged on and on (my perspective only, of course, others can have different opinions)-- 

Anyway, so as a result, I stopped there. For good. (I know he has a ton of other books in the series - I don't care)

Additionally, if I hate a book and its super popular, or I hate a book and its super obscure, I feel the same way.  For example, I was forced to read ""A Tale of Two Cities"",  when I was in school - one of the so-called classics. I hated that book so much, and never read it, beyond the first 30 pages or so, for my class, even though it was required reading in school. Same for another book called the ""Red Badge of Courage"". On the other hand I loved a book called ""The Good Earth"" which was also considered ""classic"" literature. So it can be hit or miss. 

Random comment about Stephen King, I don't read any of his new stuff. I feel its bad. I agree with others that his best stuff was earlier. Pet Sematery, Cujo, and his early short stories were amazing. His modern stuff can go to hell, as far as I'm concerned, lol",""

I don’t think I’ll ever go near him ever again because I’ve lost all faith in an author willing to put out something like that… my feeling was after selling movie rights to the watchers he was cynically trying to bang out another to bag another movie deal.

Read another straight after I read the previous one—it was good. Read the next one, again, straight after—it was good, but it was trash too.

And really, there's a reason why I am saying it's trash. This reason, in fact, is why I think the other books, including the ones above that I said were good, are trash(One of Us is Lying not Included).

This is because, despite being a crime book, not one book of the 3 I read in High school had a person that was at least quarter-important to the story die.

I read Kate Atkinson's Life after Life last year. The writing style was quirky, but so were the characters and the plot, and I thought everything worked well together. I then read the sequel (A God in Ruins). Writing was still quirky, but there was a lot of overlap with characters in the first book, so it was okay.

I then picked up Case Histories, which has a completely different storyline, and the same ""quirky"" writing style drove me bats. I DNFd after a chapter or two. I very much enjoyed the series on Peacock, though.

Riley Sager is one this year that I tried two of his books, and I just don't like them. Easy reads, but he infuriates me. 


There was also another writer who the first book kinda irked me with him having the characters constantly yawning. But I was still able to read the second book. I was in agony the whole time. They yawned so much! At one point, a mother and son started a chain yawn reaction and this went on a whole paragraph! And several times in that scene!

So those are two authors on my Do Not Ever Read Again list. They got 2 tries. I couldn't make it to 3.


My other one is specifically when they reference Black characters simply as ""tall black"". Irks my soul. Fully immersed in the story, everyone and their dog, familar, butterfly, etc gets an extremely detailed description and the one random Black character is described as ""tall black.""


I actually give 3 tries for that if I otherwise like their stories. I also will keep reading an author if Black portrayal improves over the course of their writing career.

But then, I'm a bit wussie and I don't like violence, so maybe I'm not the target audience.","lpr8ren"

So many established booktokkers often seem to be talking about whatever’s getting a heavy promotion this week.","lprywx2"
"lpthj70","alainel0309","2024-10-01 14:42:19 UTC","I found booktok to be 85% about romance novels. So I dial it in by specifying genre and its still a bit hit and miss.","lprywx2"
"lqh4tpk","LathropWolf","2024-10-05 16:17:28 UTC","Same here, but I don't mind it within reason. Also tend to prefer some ""alternative"" details authors don't think about commonly for any number of reasons.

If it's going to be 5 pages though of a character turning a door knob, yeah no...","lpw0ygo"

I’m always glad to have a good LGBTQ character in a book, but she went off the deep end with the constant brooding depression and the James-Bondish computer tech devices she came up with.  I read somewhere that Cornwell is not writing any more Scarpetta novels, which is a relief.","lpv1kvy"

"lprg5t4","JustaBasicGemini","2024-10-01 03:52:10 UTC","Yeah, all authors have bad days, not all books they write are gonna be masterpieces. Although it does depend on if the characters/plot is bad, or if the writing style itself is bad. Cause to be fair I'm not one to read stories with super long descriptions, like one book I read that had page long descriptions of something. Couldn't read it lol, I need a little bit of a break from paragraph pages.","lprfrvb"
"lq0tcxy","TTurt","2024-10-02 19:14:33 UTC","I was legit ready to argue with you when I read that first line out of context 😂🤣

The nefarious thing about the Taking is that it's not immediately obvious that it's just Left Behind written by HP Lovecraft, but that's exactly what it is","lq0r9am"
"lpucb07","Elulah","2024-10-01 17:28:00 UTC","Yeah.  Normal people is very much out of my comfort zone anyway (book club pick), but I particularly disliked it.  I am trying to expand my repertoire but books outside my usual remit are already up against it so to speak, so then when I cant get away with the author’s style on top of that, or if the plot falls flat (both of those things happened for me with normal people), it’s nail in the coffin time.","lpu0wb1"

I know he usually has conservative aesops for his endings so I was expecting somewhat of a trash ending (having read Sole Survivor, Eyes of Darkness and that one where the cult is trying to kill the main lead's kid because they think he's the devil, whose name escapes me at the moment), but what I for some reason hadn't learned to expect yet was ""ok we have hit the contractually obligated minimum word count to publish, time to wrap up. Uhhh all the demons were sufficiently convinced of her evangelical faith so they went home and put back all the good Christian folk, but all the bad liberals who didn't vote for the right politicians stayed dead and the world was a better place. Also it was Satan. The end.""","lq2x2j3"
