Addie is a teenager in a bumfuck nowhere village in 18th century France. She hangs around France for much of her history in a time when news traveled slowly.

Some people enjoy the atmospheric style of books, but it‚Äôs just not for me. I need someone interesting and dynamic to root for, like Victor or Delilah and Addie was not it. I also came away with the impression that the relationship between the devil and Addie was just very superficial.

They spend like 5 pages on her being a spy for the French Resistance! Second, the *author* could have had her placed nearer those events, like Forrest Gump but...you know, sane and well written. Third, her entire character is totally unrealistic and anachronistic. She has very modern and cosmopolitan attitudes for a shit smeared starving illiterate peasant girl.


If not historical events it could have focused so much more on her interactions with artists - the idea of her influencing art to leave a mark on the world  was  maybe the most ineresting part of the book, but the author did little to nothing with it. I guess that would have taken actual research on art history. And if not THAT, then maybe focus more on the dichotomy between the two leads, one who is cursed with immortality and the other cursed to die. The fleeting beauty of life, the importance of real connections with other people. But again, instead we get a plot where a brooding spooky fairy man is emotionally abusive but so darn hot and brooding our heroine just can't resist.

This book had a great premise and wasted it on a skeevy, poorly fleshed out romance plot. I've read better fay smut on ao3. It gets a pass just because the prose is good and some people want to identify with the manic pixie dream girl protagonist.","lqafzdd"
