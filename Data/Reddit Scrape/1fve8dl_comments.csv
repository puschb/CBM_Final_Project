It made me appreciate the flow of arts and crafts and books in my own life, the magic of time and space that creates the perfect expression of something ephemeral that I get to keep forever.


I didn't think it was good, it read like a beach read.  Then again, making the highly intangible concept digestible is a skilled feat in itself, which turned that thought to admiration.


Putting complex ideas into the world is hard work and it was done in a fun rompy way.  ",""

What it’s like finally to be seen and understood for the very first time when she runs into another mortal human being after 300yrs. It’s captivating and horrific in trying to survive isolation and loneliness through an on going wish between an immortal god and a mortal human being. The will to live and prove otherwise and I love her stubbornness.

It was recommended by a few coworkers so I gave it a read and I just feel like the MC wasted so much of what was an interesting premise. With essentially unlimited time on earth there’s so much she could have learned and mastered and I was absolutely expecting her to have gained some knowledge on earth that the devil didn’t have and that’s how she would beat her curse in the end. Instead she just spent the book hooking up with artists and doing… not much.

She’s not offering ideas or creating art. She doesn’t seem to care what effect she has on the world, or about developing meritorious qualities in herself.

Addie is a teenager in a bumfuck nowhere village in 18th century France. She hangs around France for much of her history in a time when news traveled slowly.

I didn’t connect with or care about the Addie character at all and nothing happened. She witnessed all of this history, yet she still managed to be extremely boring. 

Some people enjoy the atmospheric style of books, but it’s just not for me. I need someone interesting and dynamic to root for, like Victor or Delilah and Addie was not it. I also came away with the impression that the relationship between the devil and Addie was just very superficial.

They spend like 5 pages on her being a spy for the French Resistance! Second, the *author* could have had her placed nearer those events, like Forrest Gump but...you know, sane and well written. Third, her entire character is totally unrealistic and anachronistic. She has very modern and cosmopolitan attitudes for a shit smeared starving illiterate peasant girl.


If not historical events it could have focused so much more on her interactions with artists - the idea of her influencing art to leave a mark on the world  was  maybe the most ineresting part of the book, but the author did little to nothing with it. I guess that would have taken actual research on art history. And if not THAT, then maybe focus more on the dichotomy between the two leads, one who is cursed with immortality and the other cursed to die. The fleeting beauty of life, the importance of real connections with other people. But again, instead we get a plot where a brooding spooky fairy man is emotionally abusive but so darn hot and brooding our heroine just can't resist.

This book had a great premise and wasted it on a skeevy, poorly fleshed out romance plot. I've read better fay smut on ao3. It gets a pass just because the prose is good and some people want to identify with the manic pixie dream girl protagonist.","lqafzdd"

A protagonist with a perfect agenda is pretty boring.  If characters always did the right thing and weren't working from the values they've picked up along the way... Realistic characters have different motivations.  Finding hers self-serving doesn't make them less valid or her less valid as a character.


She cannot connect with people, how can she care about their fleeting stories?  She'll hear more stories tomorrow.  What she can't see is herself.  She has no reflection in the world except for the ephemeral moment someone looks right at her.  Treasuring her image being captured, feeling seen, is really relatable to me.

But Addie can't look beyond her own reflection (neither can Henry, for that matter. I think the reason he's still bummed out when everyone loves him is that he doesn't want connection to others, he wants validation).
