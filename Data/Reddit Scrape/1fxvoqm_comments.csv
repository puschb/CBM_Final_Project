"lqpjkk5","hauntingvacay96","2024-10-07 01:10:22 UTC","Her short story The Lottery is possibly one of the most anthologized short stories ever and is read widely within classrooms. 

With that said, it features a post world war 2 commentary on the ritualistic nature of rural communities whereas much of her novels are centered on women, more specifically women’s identities in a patriarchal society (The Lottery does this also). A lot of her work is about women gone mad. 

I also suspect that her being labeled as a horror writer (she is) and playing that up to an extent means her work doesn’t get the recognition it deserves. 

It’s been interesting being a Shirley Jackson fan over the course of the last 20 years and really watching people, both the general population and academia, find more interest and reevaluate her work. I wonder what that says about her time and ours?

Edit: also I’m taking this as my opportunity to demand you read The Sundial as it’s her best work and also suggest her domestic memoirs, Life Among the Savages and Raising Demons. All three really show off Jackson’s humor and wit.",""
"lqpj14u","PricklyBasil","2024-10-07 01:06:44 UTC","I mean, horror as a category is still looked down on and the fact she is a woman is still relevant, unfortunately.

  
But, that being said, The Lottery is often taught at the high school level now and I’m studying her in college right now, where she comes up quite often as an important American writer.

I would also say that, within the horror and weird fiction communities, she is very well known and popular still.",""

Fortunately, her kids have been good (and savvy)  literary executors, which has sparked a revival of her work and a reevaluation of her place in the literary world. It's a healthy thing that happens to a lot of authors, and important if they're going to go on to assume a bigger footprint in the bookstore and at colleges. 

She tended to be thought of as a genre writer, and I get why that is. ""The Order of Charlotte's Going,"" for instance, is a genre piece -- but you're missing out on really good writing if you only see it through that lens.

"lqpnkkc","Quodlibet30","2024-10-07 01:36:53 UTC","As far as not taught more — yes, it’s probably partly because of genre. It looked like with her final work in progress that she was taking quite a turn in style, but her early death interrupted it.

She had a short, complicated tragic life, with a miserable manipulative mother and a brilliant, controlling and two-faced gaslighting faithless husband. My opinion is she was shelved in that impossible literary place of being “just a housewife” because of the times, despite her talents. Her literary critic husband claimed she wasn’t recognized as she deserved to be, yet he was such a huge contributing factor to mucking with the possibility of her achieving that. He caused such misery in her life between the affairs, keeping her essentially a financial hostage (despite her making much more than he did), binding her closer to her insecurities and leaving her to the childrearing and housekeeping. Not a lot of time for writing, in between all that. 

There was a recent bio of her well worth reading.

"lqw5ulg","quantcompandthings","2024-10-08 04:29:25 UTC","i feel like it's because most of her stories are uncomfortable to read. there is not only no hope for the present, there isn't any for the future either. the patriarchy is garbage, but the current crop of women aren't shining beacons of hope either. her short stories are even more more bleak and depressing than Castle and Hillhouse.

i think what a lot of the so called Great American Authors have in common is that even when they're describing something bad, there is always hope for something better. it's clear who the bad guy is and where the finger of blame is pointing, whether it's greedy owners, materialism and greed, or war and fascism.  

jackson's world view is nothing so simple. even in times of apparent peace and prosperity, people are miserable and hungry, it's hard to tell who isn't a villain or bitch. the people who definitely are obviously neither are usually downtrodden, and end the story even more downtrodden than the beginning.

""The Haunting of Hill House, after The Lottery, is the work most often associated with Jackson, but she is no longer widely read. This isn't necessarily surprising; the successful novelists of one generation often evaporate from the awareness of the next, and it probably didn't help her reputation in literary circles that she sometimes wrote as a kind of thinking woman's Erma Bombeck. (Then, even more than now, the domestic realm was viewed as insufficiently serious.) Still, Jackson's clean, terse style and her toughmindness ought to appeal to the kind of readers who kept Patricia Highsmith and James M Cain in print today. In a way, Jackson was kindred spirit to the hard-boiled genre novelists of her time. She also depicted the cruel jokes of fate and chance unfolding in an amoral universe. It's just that instead of doing it with men and guns, she chose to write about mad, lonely girls and big, sinister houses.""",""

She’s a phenomenal writer.  She’s overlooked because she’s a woman, because her protagonists are women, because her books are classified as “genre,” and because she was a genius at stories when only novels are taken seriously.

The Demon Lover is one of my absolute favorite stories.  The way that specific, concrete details manage to create less and less reality is truly amazing.

I read some biographical works, and it doesn’t seem that she had a happy life.  Her mother and her husband both criticized her pretty cruelly for not being conventionally feminine, and her success as a writer infuriated her husband.

Certainly one of the best of all time. But horror as a genre will always struggle to match the prestige of literary fiction. It prioritizes plot and tension over character, which is obviously essential to the success of the kind of storytelling Jackson does, but it also lacks the insight into human nature that Steinbeck or Austen are lauded for. For better or worse, critics and academics are looking for deep, interesting, memorable characters. Can you even name one of the characters from Haunting of Hill House? I’ve read it and I loved it but the characters were mostly just there to advance the story.

Edit: downvote me all you like. It won’t change the basic facts. Jackson is not on the same artistic level as Hemingway, Woolf, or many of the great writers of the 20th century. She’s not an innovator. She didn’t change the trajectory of literary writing, the way these other writers did. That’s the truth.","lqpinko"

It’s a basic fact that Eleanor isn’t a widely known cultural icon like Gatsby, or Mrs Dalloway, or Mr Darcy. It’s a basic fact that writing effective horror requires the author to prioritize tension and conflict over deep exploration of character. Jackson manages this far, far better than most.

"lr2mac1","WendyDarling-2024","2024-10-09 10:51:35 UTC","Well I’ve only read the three books of hers I listed in my original post. What I noticed with each of them is that for the most part the main female characters are bristling against being told what to do and who to be. They all have a very interesting, I would almost say “free thinking” mindset. It’s not necessarily a stable mindset - as it often is indicated there are mental health issues. But even within that context there are a lot of creative and original thoughts being expressed. It seems to me that for those people who are trying to ban books to help themselves to repress people and maintain “traditional values” they would take issue with her work. Even if her characters don’t get a “happy ending” - their free thought and attempts to liberate themselves and be more independent go against the traditional roles often forced upon women.

In general I’m not sure how we keep her work or anyone’s work alive in the world. Especially in today’s world. Being a person who enjoys reading has never been something that was truly in vogue even when I was a teen in the 90s. Social Media like Tik Tok or YouTube does suggest that there is a desire to read out there in the youth - BUT I don’t get the impression that same group is very interested in reading books that predate the 2000’s - let alone Jackson’s works from the 50’s or 60’s.

See how silly this sort of thing is? It’s funny that you should bring up Austen, btw. She gets unfairly thought of as “just” a “genre writer” by people who miss her social commentary, sharp wit, etc (…kind of reminds me of the situation with a certain other author). If Austen wasn’t already (deservedly) considered an Important Author would there be a discussion of her literary merits happening in this thread, as well? Can’t help but feel like you’re fixating on an author’s canonical status (or lack thereof) as some sort of end-all-be-all thing.

The novel both evokes fear and says something about human nature. What do you mean The Haunting of Hill House isn’t about exploring character? It’s a character study of Eleanor. It’s all about her loneliness, lack of a sense of self, and desperate desire to find a place where she belongs. These are not uncommon parts of the human experience, and these are also why people are susceptible to things like cults and/or abusive relationships. It’s not just “scary things happen at scary house” or whatever. You’re very much proving others’ point that the “horror” genre label was probably a big factor in why Jackson has been unfairly overlooked.

So do you have an actual argument/explanation? Is it that Jackson wasn’t a stylistic innovator? Sure ok, but her prose is still typically regarded as excellent (and it is), though, and if a lack of stylistic innovation factored into her being overlooked it’s not really necessarily a reason why she should continue to be so. OP never even brought up Woolf. It really does feel like you just don’t want Jackson to have a seat at the cool kids table. Did Fitzgerald innovate? If not, should we get rid of his spot at the table? Other than the point about innovation you’ve mostly just been basically saying “Jackson isn’t considered as Important of an author as those guys because she isn’t considered as Important of an author as those guys” lol

The thing is, regardless of if one thinks Jackson should be considered a “great American writer” or not (I do; I gather that you don’t), OP raised an interesting and, I think, complex question. How is the literary canon decided/formed? By who? How do the taste of the time, artistic movements, and historical context/social movements (during the author’s life and after the author’s death) affect things? How does image/marketing/reception during the author’s life factor in? I don’t know the answers here, but these questions are more interesting to me than tier lists or who invented things. Andrew Wyeth was an American artist whose paintings have always been popular with the public but among critics/the establishment reception has fluctuated (well received at first, but then his work was dismissed by the avant-garde). In the ‘70s, one art historian nominated him for both “the most underrated American artist” and “the most overrated American artist” categories. His legacy has been re-evaluated by art historians recently. I like both Wyeth’s and Jackson’s work and they’re the artists I think of when I think of re-evaluation and how legacy isn’t a static thing. There’s not some objectively correct answer to “how ‘good’ of a novelist is Shirley Jackson?”","lqpt1qy"

It’s kind of amazing how some themes remain relevant even decades later, especially when it comes to personal freedom and resisting tradition. It’s sad that even though these characters may not get a ‘happy ending,’ their resistance still sends a powerful message.

As for keeping her work alive, I feel the same concern. I think the rise of book communities on platforms like TikTok (BookTok) has helped in getting people excited about reading again, but like you said, the focus is often on newer releases. It makes me wonder if older classics will eventually fade from view or if they’ll resurface in cycles. Maybe it’s up to readers like us to recommend them and keep those conversations alive.

We love horror and we teach it at our schools. The Road is a horror masterpiece. It won the Pulitzer Prize. You know why? Because it’s both a stunning use of language and a deeply insightful examination of human nature. Haunting of Hill House is simply not at the level of artistic achievement as a book like The Road. Yes, Hill House is good. Yes, it’s widely acknowledged as a masterpiece of horror. But it is NOT an artistic achievement on the level of the great writers already mentioned.

"lr1oqu6","Loramarthalas","2024-10-09 04:25:32 UTC","I agree. It is an interesting question to consider how the canon is formed. Generally, we laud those writers who break new ground or influence the direction of literature. They become the truly great artists, and the ones we point to and say ‘they did it first’. This whole thread is about how we define literary merit, so yes, I am fixating on the authors status in the canon because that was the question asked by the OP. 

But as I said in another reply, Jackson has never really been considered more than an excellent horror writer because her work is derivative, in the genre theory sense of the term, meaning she takes her tropes from other books. The wonky architecture in Hill House is a trope from Lovecraft. The slow unwinding of the intellect brought in by fear is taken from Poe and Gillman. It’s classic gothic stuff and it was already 150 years old when Jackson was writing. Yes, she does it well. Yes, Hill House is a brilliant book it’s one of the greatest horror overs ever written. 

But it’s still a horror novel. It’s still just the continuation of an older tradition. It’s something we’ve seen before, many times. 

Now, compare that to Hemingway who upended how we write prose. His innovations still influence writers today. He gave us something truly new. Or compare it to Austen who brings a journalistic attention to detail in her writing and effectively creates a new form — realism. Is it fair to put Jackson alongside them? I don’t think so. Many in this thread want to claim she’s at their level, but no serious critic would agree.","lr1m9bs"

How are we supposed to delineate between the achievements of women? What criteria should we use to judge them? Jackson is considered a great in her genre.

"lr6o534","MartianHeaven","2024-10-10 01:16:59 UTC","She didn’t invent haunted houses or spooky architecture, but you realize people aren’t *only* inspired by other literature, right? The synthesis of many things, with one’s personal perspective and additions, makes things interesting and fresh. Fun fact: Jackson came from a family of architects. It’s where her family’s money came from, designing houses for the wealthy in California. Right on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_of_Hill_House) for The Haunting of Hill House there’s a bit about her inspiration/process—she talks about reading lots of traditional ghost stories (so yes, she’s was obviously inspired by works in the genre), but there’s other things, too, like reading about a group of nineteenth century psychic researchers and also (Jackson claims) a California house she found in a magazine (that her mother said Jackson’s great-great-grandfather designed).

You didn’t really engage with my questions other than once again bringing up that we remember and value people who innovate/did things first. Yeah, that’s part of it, but is that all there is to it? The formation of literary canon is a part of history. I’m curious about the details of the how, the who, the interplay of the individual and social, that sort of thing. (Also, did Fitzgerald—who, again, OP specifically mentioned—invent a new literary technique? I had a look at his wikipedia page and saw that he thought his works, once popular, were forgotten at the time of his death, but they went through a critical re-evaluation later on… interesting.)

You’re missing a lot about The Haunting of Hill House by thinking of it as just some sort of trope mish mash. ""The Yellow Wallpaper""? Two stories with women and madness, must just be pretty much saying and about the same thing, eh? Eleanor (unmarried) doesn’t have a husband who imprisons her (also, yeah, women in the ‘50s were obviously expected to/under a ton of pressure to marry, but it’s interesting to note that the other major female character of the novel, Theodora, is pointedly unmarried and in some sort of relationship with a partner of unspecified gender), she chooses to go to Hill House and she chooses to stay at Hill House (the others try to send her away for her own good) because she is desperate for a place to belong and she has not connected with other people in a way that she hoped for… btw is there a Poe story about all this *specifically*, this longing for a place to belong and to connect with others and the failure to do so? I could make a whole tl;dr post (The Haunting of Hill House wasn’t her only novel), but I know it’s not going to change your mind, so I’ll stop here.

I get it, your point is that Jackson didn’t “invent” anything. This seems to be the ultimate criterion of literary merit for you and it isn’t for me, so I think we’ll just have to agree to disagree. I’m bowing out of this here. I will just say: I don’t think this is a zero-sum game. The themes Jackson wrote about so well are clearly resonating with people (perhaps this says something about the internet age, but I also think they’re perennially resonant), so I don’t see the “harm” in her re-evaluation. Just because Jackson is being re-discovered doesn’t mean someone else has to be un-discovered.","lr1oqu6"

"lr72mpd","Loramarthalas","2024-10-10 02:52:42 UTC","Sure, and all of this is very interesting **in the context of horror fiction.** Jackson is widely considered a master of the genre these days, after exactly the kinds of re-evaluation you're talking about (not that she was ever forgotten, she's always been popular). But you have to recognise that she's writing within the confines of her genre, which demands that she draws on existing tropes, and prioritises an atmosphere of fear and anxiety for her readers. 

Compare that to, say, Woolf, who creates out of whole cloth new ways of writing about female psychology. Or Plath, who was writing at roughly the same time as Jackson, who gives us such a stunning, devastating book like The Bell Jar, which deals with the same themes as Hill House. We laud these writers because they do something truly new. 

I know that people hate the way genre fiction is viewed as less important than literary fiction, but that's how the literary community operates. We all value artistic writers who push the art form forward. They find new ways to do old things. They rightly deserve to be lauded for those innovations. It's exceedingly rare for someone to change the direction of an art form, the way Hemingway changed writing. For that reason, he earns his reputation among readers. 

No one is saying Jackson should be forgotten. It's the opposite. She's now widely seen as an essential figure in the development of horror as a form. But it's plain wrong to say that she changed how we write, or invented new forms, or showed artistic genius. We reserve those kinds of plaudits for the true giants of literature.","lr6o534"

"lqrmgrz","HugoNebula","2024-10-07 12:27:43 UTC","Firstly, your argument is essentially meritless, as it rests upon the assertion that Hemingway, Woolf, etc, have been taught in schools and discussed ad infinitum over many decades, whereas Jackson was female and writing in what was seen as a genre ghetto, and most of her work outside of *The Haunting of Hill House* and *The Lottery* was out of print soon after it was published. If you can't see why she lacked the supposed stature of the writers you laud, I can't help you.

Given her recent renaissance over the last decade or two, which has seen almost all of her work returned to print, some of it filmed—more, or less, successfully—and lately given the credit it always deserved, it's obvious to anyone that her themes, particularly those of the female experience, along with examinations of isolation and mental health, are not only, if anything, more relevant today, but were years ahead of her time. 

Her writing, with a delicious sentence structure, definition of character through arch, often subtle, dialogue, a wicked sense of humour that underlines as much as it undercuts the narrative, and a way of telling a story under the apparent story, is the equal of Woolf, and surpasses Hemingway's thudding prose in a way I'd expect almost anyone who has read more than a dozen books to understand without it needing to be explained.

Also, ok, (is this how Columbo feels?) just one more thing… what point are you trying to make about Plath and The Bell Jar? The Bell Jar was published after The Haunting of Hill House fwiw. It’s not like the works are the same thing (there are similarities, but they’re not about exactly the same thing and Eleanor and Esther, or Plath, aren’t basically the same or something) and also 1959 (The Haunting of Hill House) vs 1963 (The Bell Jar), if it matters to you. Another fun fact: Plath admired Jackson and wanted to meet her while doing an internship at Mademoiselle. And about TBJ, some similarities and possible influences, how about Jackson’s novel Hangsaman (1951)? Obviously idk for sure, but I doubt Plath would have been offended to have Jackson mentioned alongside her. You really walked into this one, but, again, I get it, Jackson included a spooky house so you’re not ever going to take The Haunting of Hill House, or her as a novelist, seriously. At this point, I’m starting to wonder if you’ve even read it and also if you have any concept of authors as people that live lives.

I guess I don’t see why genre matters so much (and literary fiction is a genre, too). Categorization can be useful, but I don’t see why if something is horror or sci-fi then we can *only* talk about it in relation to other horror or sci-fi, or why we can *only* classify it (or its author) as “good for X genre”. I think The Haunting of Hill House is great horror and great in general. I think The Fifth Head of Cerberus and The Book of the New Sun are great science-fiction and great in general. Jackson’s and Wolfe’s work have genre tropes like a haunted house, clones, and a dying earth (that they didn’t invent) but so what? There’s a subjectiveness to all of this, anyways (there’s not some sort of scientific measure we can use to determine “great literature”—between two excellent writers how can we tell who is more excellent, anyways?—this isn’t a math problem).

But since you’re fixated on genre: what genre is We Have Always Lived in the Castle? It’s obviously not a ghost story. There are no ghosts. Nothing supernatural happens. Mystery? Lol, gee I wonder who poisoned the Blackwood family five years ago, whoever could it have been (and this question isn’t driving the plot anyways). Is it horror (what makes something horror, as a “genre novel”?)? I guess? It is unsettling (though, once again, there’s more to it than just being unsettling). What makes it not (also) general “literature”, though? The fact that the narrator is disturbing and has killed people? Capital L Literature isn’t allowed to have a sociopathic womanchild narrator that has killed people? No disturbing narrators allowed? What’s the deal with Lolita, then? Or is it because the house burns down and then there’s a ruined building and that’s a gothic trope so into the genre bin it goes? Or is the issue that Jackson wrote a couple books (two out of six) with supernatural elements (The Haunting of Hill House and The Sundial, which is satire/horror/gothic but whatever)? 

And that’s it from me.","lr72mpd"

Honestly, the fact that you’re even taking the time to discuss Shirley Jackson in such depth shows that you’re already doing more than most. Sometimes it’s those quiet voices that can create the most lasting impact, especially when they share something meaningful.

As much as I’d like to see educators take up the cause, I think our little conversations here can spark curiosity too. Who knows? Maybe someone lurking in the comments will pick up a Shirley Jackson book because of this and fall in love with her work. In a way, we’re already doing our part.

But hey, if it ever crossed your mind to push it a bit further, I’d totally be down to brainstorm some low-key ways to spread the word. Who says introverts can’t leave a mark, right?","lr9irpx"

Like there’s a concerted effort by critics and academics around the world to make sure she’s not given her due? Because she is widely studied and widely taught. She’s not being hidden or kept away from view. She simply isn’t the kind of artistic innovator that merits the same kind of attention as Woolf or Hemingway. She didn’t changed the trajectory of literature the way those writers did.","lqrllfg"

The one who’s changed the direction of literature. Hemingway’s style was so influential that entire generations of writers copied him. Woolf pioneered the kind of internal, psychological examination of female mental health that Jackson later relied on. That’s why we consider these authors as truly great. That’s why Jackson is brilliant, yes, and a master of her genre, yes, but not an innovator. Not a game changer. That’s no slight on Jackson. She’s one of the best writers of the 20th century. But there’s a clear difference between here work and the work of the authors OP mentioned.","lqrmgrz"

I'm explaining to you the orthodoxy. This is the current state of how the entire literary community views artistic writing. We value writers who do something new. The Haunting of Hill House does very little that's new, even though it's excellent and terrifying. Nothing you say will ever change that basic fact. Is the orthodoxy wrong? Should we place more value on writers who do things excellently, rather than break new ground? I'd say we already give excellent writers plaudits. Jackson is a huge and influential literary figure. But she is not -- and never will be -- the equal of Hemingway or Woolf or Steinbeck or Joyce or Austen. Yes, there are horror novels that break new ground and are considered artistic masterpieces. The Road is one recent example. The classic gothic novels like The Monk or The Castle of Otranto are others. But once a genre is established, and you're using tropes already made famous by other authors, and you're working within pre-defined parameters, it's very hard to argue that you're doing something new.","lrc8629"

Characters are just there to advance the story. 

And every time you come up with a new parameter which tells me that I’m not going to be changing your mind and if I address your questions here this is just going to keep going. You’ve dug your heals in. 

I think you have done a poor reading of her body of work, if you’ve even read further than Hill House.

"lqurp7k","Loramarthalas","2024-10-07 22:58:23 UTC","Time has already told who is right. Jackson is where she is in the canon because her work simp,y doesn’t measure up to the greats like Steinbeck and Woolf. It’s not some conspiracy to keep her out of the canon because she’s a woman. It’s not a matter of taste. She is an outstanding horror writer and widely lauded for that. But she is not an artistic innovator. She did not break new ground with her characterisation or her prose or her psychological insights. Everything she did had been done before by better writers. No one in this thread has been able to give any compelling reasons why she should be elevated to the status of artistic genius, like Hemingway and Steinbeck and Woolf and Austen. It’s obvious why.","lquji13"
"lr070ep","Loramarthalas","2024-10-08 21:48:19 UTC","Yes, she is inferior when compared to the greatest writers who ever lived. Why is that even remotely controversial? It’s so obviously true that I can’t understand why people are so resistant to it. She is not an artistic genius. She’s a very good writer. But she’s working with plot tropes that existed for hundreds of years before she began writing Haunting of Hill House. She’s working in a genre that was already established before she was even born. Nothing she did in HHH is new  I mean, even the representation of female psychology pushed to breakdown was done better in The Yellow Wallpaper. 

What new ground did she break? What boundaries did she push? Of course, you don’t have to do those things to be an excellent writer. Jackson is absolutely an excellent writer. As I’ve said many times, HHH is one of the best horror novels of all time. But the question OP asked is why she’s not considered on the level of Hemingway or Steinbeck. Or if you prefer, Woolf and Austen. She’s not considered at that level because her work is derivative in the generic sense of the term. She derives her stories from tropes she read in her genre. Unlike Woolf, who creates entirely new genres. Or Hemingway, who redefines how we approach the construction of prose. Or Austen who pioneered realism — realism, for fucks sake —- the most important and impactful change in literature since the printing press. 

The fact that I have to explain these extremely basic points in this thread just shows how little you all know.","lqxv22b"

The question OP is asking is about why she’s not considered at the level of Hemingway or Steinbeck. It’s obvious why. She’s not an innovator in the same way as Hemingway, Woolf, or Steinbeck. She’s working in a well established genre with well established tropes. She’s not forging new ground with Haunting of Hill House, the same way Woolf did something never before seen with Mrs Dalloway for example, or Hemingway with For Whom The Bell Tolls.","lqx1m8u"

I'm trying patiently to explain them to you, since it's clear that you don't understand them. 

For what's worth, my own opinion on Fitzgerald is that he's overrated. I get that Gatsby is important because it was a huge bestseller and highly influential. He also captured the mood and spirit of the 20s perhaps better than any other writer. But he didn't really do much that was new. He iterated on the formula established by Austen, Dickens, and Hardy -- wealthy families, working class imposters, tragic endings. But he was a fantastic prose writer, so that carries him a long way.

Your involvement (indoctrination, whatever) into academia has led you to believe that these authors are the be-all and end-all, and that your following this doctrine means you're right, whatever you say, whatever anyone says in disagreement.

And if your university course is as obsessed with the greatest and most innovative of all possible authors, there's a wealth of material you seem to be missing.

Also, King has Jackson beat on sheer depth of characterisation, any day of the week.

Any road up: the question, as you keep reminding us, is why Jackson is not considered at the level of Hemingway or Steinbeck. I asserted it was because she was female, writing 'horror', and most of her work was out of print for many years. In a phrase: literary snobbery and genre ghettoisation.

And everything you have said to refute this has pretty much substantiated it.","lqx2bdm"
"lrdea83","MartianHeaven","2024-10-11 05:39:28 UTC","I was being really rude/snarky and I’m sorry. I genuinely feel bad about it (I know tone is hard to get across with text, so I hope I’m not coming across as insincere here). I think you were being pretty dismissive to others, and acting like they didn’t know anything in the comments, too, though. I shouldn’t have acted like I did, though, and I was definitely being an ass and you were being more patient with me than I was with you.

I think I was mostly hoping for your own takes on things and also trying to get at the idea that I think it’s important to remember that this stuff is subjective/arbitrary and I think at some point really does come down to personal preference (and/or I guess also collective personal preference? Idk how to put it exactly). It’s totally ok if Jackson’s work isn’t quite your thing, but I do think her being overlooked and then re-evaluated is an interesting phenomenon and I was hoping for answers/discussion more than “that’s how it’s been” (I studied history so this sort of thing interests me). I guess I was also reacting because I feel like we (collectively in general) should be careful to not get too caught up in which artist is “better” than who. We all do it, and it’s inevitable, and we all have a sense about/for it (I think there is a sort of threshold of quality that is there but hard to define exactly, but I think every writer we’ve been talking about passes it), but I feel it’s not what art is ultimately about.

I’m not in teaching/academia so I understand there’s things I don’t get and also that your perspective is going to be really different from mine. Like, to me, I don’t think acknowledging an author means kicking another one out, but I get how maybe it could feel different in teaching. Things seem so polarized on the internet and I do see a lot of “we don’t need to learn about X anymore”-type takes that I can see how it could feel like acknowledgement of someone is a “threat” to someone else. And I imagine it’s got to be rough in teaching with AI and students not reading.

I think you’re still being a bit condescending, though. How don’t I understand artistic merit? Also I’ve literally made points that you haven’t addressed at all (for example, by what measure is WHALitC a “horror” novel and not “literature”?). Can’t you see what I was getting at in my last comment: the “canon” already acknowledges excellence without requiring innovation (e.g., Fitzgerald) so why can’t Jackson be considered? Are you saying we should ONLY acknowledge innovation? This is evidently not how it currently works. Please don’t try to shut me down by not engaging with my points and saying I don’t know anything (you’ve done this with other commenters, too). I’m saying this neutrally, I mean this without snark—do you recognize that this is what you’ve been doing?

I think we feel similarly about Fitzgerald. I try not the think about it in terms of ratings, but he doesn’t really click for me personally, and I agree that his prose is great. Newness/invention isn’t as important to me, but yeah I agree, I think Gatsby is recognized for its themes and its picture of the ‘20s. But even if his work doesn’t really speak to me, but it probably does for other people, and I don’t think he should be un-acknowledged or anything. (But I’ve only read The Great Gatsby \\[and it’s been a long time\\] and Tender is the Night, and I really didn’t like the latter, though, so I admit my opinion is going to be limited and not very fair.) 

I hope there’s no hard feelings. Again, I’m sorry.","lrcwcvz"
