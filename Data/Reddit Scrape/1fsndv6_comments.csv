"lplzp5a","dethb0y","2024-09-30 05:44:20 UTC","Those are both stories carried by the effects, actors and setting, rather than the writing itself.

Notably, the Terminator's story line is an irrational mess full of plot holes and inconsistencies - why certain things happen seems to be ""because the plot needs them to happen"". Terminator 2 makes this even more noticeable and is arguably even less coherent as a story. Lots of scenes clearly are meant to *look* cool, but don't make a lot of sense outside of that ambition. 

Aliens is better than either terminator film, but i wouldn't consider the writing the strong suit of the film, but rather the characters and SFX (both of which are absolutely superb) and the well-done sets that really feel ""real"" in a sense. The world building makes no rational sense at all and the actual story itself feels pretty janky. Weyland-Yutani seems like a paradox that exists only for plot reasons (not a sign of good writing), and the story itself feels very forced and contrived.

I won't even go so far as to say borrowing ideas is a bad thing, it's just he's so ham-handed in the way he writes. Honestly I think the best writing he did was in the first Terminator and Aliens(I'll give The Abyss a nod, but that's only good because of the cast). It all felt pretty honest and ""real"". Everything else is just hit a beat, great visual, hit another beat, great visual, and it's all so cliché because he uses other people's work to have a reason to make movies that are visually impressive.

I went off harder on him than I needed to but the dude doesn't have an original story writing bone in his body and his characters are just shallow vessels to allow him to play in whatever cool new visual sandbox he's made. He's a visual creator and excels at that, it's in his background as an fx artist.

As I said though outside of the two aforementioned movies, his stuff is not for me and him commenting on AI makes me laugh. If he actually used AI for his scripts we might actually get some depth to go a long with his vision.","lpx83q2"

The T1000 is sloppily written - it's basically a god. Nothing hurts it, nothing concerns it, nothing impacts it. They hit it with everything from a pipe to a 40mm grenade and it basically just shrugs it off; they end up finally killing it via what amounts to a MacGuffin (that blatantly rips off Lord of the Rings, at that). 

The behavior of all parties is stupid, from the Resistance to Skynet (who, if nothing else, *should* be rational and intelligent above all else) to Sarah Connor to the T1000. No one acts like a person, they all act like movie characters, bumping the scenes forward as they go. 

The T800 is unnecessary and a blatant effort to keep Schwarzenegger in the film. Even his final sacrifice is unnecessary. 

The entire Cyberdyne aspect is ham-fisted; it should be the *resistance* targeting Cyberdyne, not Sarah Connor having a wild idea.

Being able to send more stuff back in time cheapens the first film and basically removes the stakes from the entire franchise - this is born out by later films being increasingly weird. 

There's more but it's just not terrifically well written. 

it IS very pretty, has great effects, lots of action etc - you won't ever be *bored* watching T2. But past that spectacle it's pretty hollow.","lpm1let"

But referring more directly to your point, prognosticating biomedical technology like curing cancer or the common cold within 5 years is really really wild - we may have better treatments, but we are not going to defeat cancer in 5 years - for a lot of cancers, we are not much better off than we were in the '70s when it comes to treatment options 

The thing about the common cold is that it's a moving target - there are so many strains and the strains can be immunologically different from each other enough that it's really hard to target them with one vaccine, even using the modern RNA technology - these immunizations would also have to be updated very frequently because of how quickly the common cold mutates 

Just one example of where they are almost certainly wildly over-optimistic 

Culture technology in 45 years is also completely wild - any travel that exceeds light speed is completely impossible - those laws of physics are almost certainly never going to be overturned - the light speed speed limit is almost certainly a true observation about a fact of the universe that we are correct about 

But then you get into some other wild technologies like tapping the ""grid"" for unlimited energy, computers that can read minds and alter thoughts from a distance using ""effectors"" - drones the size of coins that can noiselessly fly and lay waste to modern aircraft carriers, Dyson spheres/orbitals...
