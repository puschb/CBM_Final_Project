Mark is a reformed killer for hire. He has vowed never to kill again and is currently following a Twelve Step program with several other former killers. His resolve is sorely tested when a Russian thug assaults him, steals his list of those to whom he plans to make amends, and stabs him in the side. He visits an underground doctor that he has used before and she demands 12 thousand dollars. Not a problem for him because as soon as he can get back to his  apartment he has plenty of money. But the Russian has been to the apartment before him and trashed and burned it.  He panics until he finds that the landlady has recued his beloved cat. Clearly the Russian is not going to go away and he is on a mission to solve the problem. But how can he resolve it without breaking his vow? I really enjoyed the humor in this one.

Finished: **A Gentleman in Moscow, by Amor Towles**

In 1922 Count Alexander Rostov faces a Bolshevik tribunal and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol hotel, a Grand Hotel in Moscow where he had been staying. This begins the story of how the aristocrat humorously deals with the progress  of the Russian revolution and rise of Soviet Russia in his own inimitable way while holding on to his manners and gentility. His encounters with the staff, fellow guests, and the authorities of the state committees offer countless opportunities for him to turn misfortune into table turning hilarity. Recommended",""

The 2 witches novels in particular were an early sign that the author was prepared to cast a hard stare at injustice and this becomes a consistent theme in his later writing.

I did read a summary before that though because I had a feeling that might happen. But I still really enjoyed it and Dickens is still on track to possibly overtake Shakespeare as my favorite classical author. 

Someone mentioned that he writes like like watching a movie, and his descriptions are so direct that you can really see that. Plus I love the slice of life writing that is not overly emotional.

**The King in Yellow, by Robert Chambers**.  I don't know why Chambers organized his story collections the way he did.  I really don't.  He hooks you with a few good horror or ""weird"" stories whose plots seem connected in mysterious ways, suggesting that it all may come together later—then swerves in the middle of the book to tell several (usually) mundane, unrelated ones about people whom you have no reason to get invested in.

Anyway.  The first half of the book, up through ""The Demoiselle d'Ys,"" was a lot of fun, but the little faux-poetic interlude that came directly after that was a waste of time.  The stories in the second half remained well-written, but I generally had to struggle to care about their cast of random bohemian art students and their 2-dimensional Parisian girlfriends.  (Both this collection, and Chambers' later ""The Mystery of Choice,"" have some of their better moments set in Brittany rather than Paris—which may reflect something about his own experiences in France, but I can't be sure.)  ""The Street of the First Shell,"" set during the 1870 siege, at least had a real plot and some emotional weight, but I could take or leave the others.

**Damnable Tales:  A Folk Horror Anthology, by Richard Wells** (ed.).  This was a fantastic collection, for what it was, but it stayed almost exclusively focused on Britain and Ireland, which I really think was a missed opportunity.  (Out of 23 stories, there were *two* set elsewhere—both in New England—and one of those was still written by an English author.)

With that limitation in mind, I think it brought together a great selection of stories, with a variety of concepts and writing styles.  There were several that drew plot points or local color from the minority Celtic cultures of the British Isles, which doesn't always turn out well, but I thought it was generally done in respectful and effective ways here.  Of the entries that I hadn't read before, ""Thrawn Janet"" (Stevenson), ""The Sin-Eater"" (MacLeod), and ""How Pan Came to Little Ingleton"" (Lawrence) were my favorites.",""

Chicken Soup for the Soul-esque. It was on my shelf for some reason (I think someone gave it to me?) and since I'm reading down my shelves, I grabbed it and read it. It's from the late 90's, and while there are some good stories in there of people working to make a difference in the world, really, it just made me sad, because so little has changed, and if anything, a lot of things have gotten worse.

Super weak plot that amounted to trauma porn, stereotypes, contrivances, and cliches from start to finish with the most boring and simplistic writing I’ve read in awhile.

The main character Victoria/Sam self-sabotaged, self-loathed, and pitied herself so often for seemingly no reason other than the drama of it all that by the end I couldn’t care less what happened to her. 

At one point >!this 14 year old tries to rob a bank with an old man who has no clue, then has him take her to a drag show to which he gets his ass kicked by a bouncer, THEN after all that she tries to give him a handjob and I wanted to yell at her through the book to FUCKING STOP. Oh and not to mention she euthanizes him with fentanyl and doctors think he just passed away peacefully in his sleep. Seriously?!<

**The Lion Women of Tehran by Marjan Kamali**  ☆☆ .5

I enjoyed all of the descriptions of food in this story. However, the overall story itself didn't really grab me. I think this book just wasn't for me. 

**Ruth by Elizabeth Gaskell** ☆☆☆

This has been my least favorite Gaskell book so far. She makes it very obvious that Ruth beauty is essential to people being willing to help her despite her sin, and hints that if she were less beautiful than they would have been much less likely to help her. That alone kind of ruined the story for me.

**If We Were Villains, by M.L. Rio** - 5/5 stars. I have had this novel recommended to me for some time now, because of the similarity to Donna Tartt's *The Secret History*, which is one of my favorite novels of all time. Despite this, I've seen a mixture of reactions to *IWWV.* I'm not sure if those with the negative reactions went in expecting *TSH* 2.0 and were sorely disappointed or what. While I can see obvious similarities to *TSH*, it's ultimately its own story, and I think it a mistake to try and compare the two. *TSH* is still the GOAT of dark academia, and will likely always be, but *IWWV* is amazing. I'm honestly going to have to read it a second time to catch everything Rio did with this.

**Family Lore, by Elizabeth Acevedo** 3.5/5. Interesting but didn’t blow me away. I adore the author’s writing style & this book really let it shine. However the characters voices didn’t have enough distinction which makes it hard to keep track when we bounce around so frequently. 

**The Jasad Heir, by Sara Hashem** 5/5. I devoured this book in 3 days. The ending was explosive, the stakes are good throughout & I loved the Egyptian-inspired world building. The romantic subplot was one of my favorites of the year (“no one gets to kill you but me” vibes). 

 CURRENTLY READING

**Best Served Cold, by Joe Abercrombie** (pg221) having a good time being back in Abercrombie’s cold & brutal world. 

**The Measure, by Nikki Erlick** (pg12) I started this during lunch because I’ve been itching to get my hands on it. Still too early to say much yet. 

**Emily Wilde’s Map of the Otherlands, by Heather Fawcett** (pg150) a nice breather compared to my other reads . So far I like Emily & Wendell more in this book but the side characters less. 

**A Sorceress Comes to Call, by T. Kingfisher** (pg116) loving finally getting to read a novel instead of a novella from Kingfisher. This is darker than I expected but has Kingfisher’s fun humor throughout.

I didn’t love the racism and sexism, yes you can say “product of its time” and that it’s showing the villains as people on the lower rung of Out There society taking power in the institutional world. I don’t know if that excuses the vibe, other 60s books aren’t quite like that. What I did like and not expect was that the story is very rooted in the societal transformation of the Pacific Northwest and the Columbia river. I lived by the upper Columbia for a while and swam in the cold river on bright spring days, so that hit. It’s like theories I have about the writing of Dune in that way but that’s too much to get into here. Shout out to the excellent *Northwest Passage: The Great Columbia River* by William Dietrich, reading that a couple years back gave me a lot of context to the deeper meaning of the Drowning of Wyam that is the thematic kernel here.

* A Sorceress Comes to Call, by T. Kingfisher—My first Kingfisher book! I enjoyed it overall, but I had some serious beef with the pacing. I think my favorite aspects were the characters and the overall atmosphere.

I just don't love reading so many in such a short period (*Part of Your World, Yours Truly,* and *Funny Story*). This is the book that inspired me to take up that mantle since so many people recommended reading the first two books before tackling this one, but I'm pretty sure I've already got the plot twist clocked (unless there's another, bigger one I'm not suspecting yet). 
* Daughter of the Forest, by Juliet Marillier—I'm liking it so far, but it's *so* dense. I'm still on the first chapter, but planning to hopefully finish it by the end of the month.

Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon.

Only 53 pages into the 1243 of the ebook so far, but it's an interesting experience so far. It's strangely gripping considering not much has happened yet.

I suspect this will be a much faster read than Moby Dick despite being longer (which is not to call Moby Dick lesser, I just needed breaks after reading it for a few hours) I could see me finishing it tomorrow if the grip holds and I read it all day.

"lszmz3c","PlasticBread221","2024-10-21 11:28:39 UTC","**The Girl Who Raced Fairyland All the Way Home, by Catherynne M. Valente** -- a satisfying end to a whimsical middle grade fantasy series that is just as suitable for adult readers as it is for kids. We get to meet almost every character for one last time and are told there's no such thing as endings because life goes on even after you stop telling the story about it. A beautifully comforting ending if I ever saw one.
Overall I enjoyed the series very much and will reread it at some point. It's prettily and cleverly written, full of creative ideas and with a philosophy that I can get behind. I do think it's not plot driven quite as much as I'd like but if it was, then it would be a different series entirely and maybe it wouldn't be as lovable anymore. 


Aside from Fairyland, I also read some poetry in prose -- Rybí šupiny (Fish Scales) by Bohuslav Reynek. It's very old (from 1922!), very Christian (literally every poem carried Christian themes and many were even directly about Christian religious figures) and very in love with the nature and countryside. My favourite was a poem about how clocks are the Devil's creation, I agree that clocks suck.


And I picked up another Czech book, Šepot z lesa (Whispers from the Woods) by Kateřina Surmanová - a spooky ghost story with some similar themes to Stephen King's It, which even gets explicitly referenced at one point!",""

**The Serial Killer Guide to San Francisco, by Michelle Chouinard**

This was a little cozy but still with some thrills and darker background happenings. Honestly I listened to this one, and what’s stuck with me most is how consistently and often the narrator mispronounced words I wouldn’t expect. Still, a fun read!

**Mississippi Blood, by Greg Iles**

I have a tough relationship with this series of Penn Cage books. Iles can really put together a dark, compelling story that’s hard to put down. In the other hand, over 17 years and 6 books, it still really stands out he’s a white man that has a tough time describing and characterizing nonwhite characters (of which there are a fair amount) in ways that don’t rely on tropes and stereotypes. Story-wise this was a great conclusion to its trilogy, but I’d like to see some kind of progress on other fronts in the next one.

**Down with the System, by Serj Tankian**

I don’t seek out memoirs much, but I love System of a Down and grew up on them and Serj’s early solo stuff. Their politics and frank criticisms of the Turkish government molded my world views early on, and this delivered about what I expected given what all I’d already known about him. Some SOAD stories, pre-SOAD life, post-SOAD endeavors and personal tales colored by his political involvement. Pretty interesting!

**I Was a Teenage Slasher, by Stephen Graham Jones**

I was lukewarm on this for the first quarter, but this took a fun turn and made the story structure much more interesting to me when it became clear what kind of story it was going to be. A fun twist on a very trope-laden genre that is horror-slashers. Just not all that horrifying or scary on its own, in my opinion.

**A Thousand Threads: A Memoir, by Neneh Cherry**

After reading **A Thousand Threads**, I realized that Neneh Cherry is the Kevin Bacon of the music world. With her parents, Moki and Don Cherry, there is no artist or jazz musician she didn’t find herself around during her childhood. In her teenage years, she ran in the same circles of many early hip-hop, New Wave, and punk artists. 

Neneh has lived and continues to live a fascinating life. Her writing conveys the heartache and frustration of dealing with Don’s drug addiction. She does a great job sharing the experience of returning to Africa with her biological father, Ahmadu Jah, and his family. The common thread throughout the book is how important family is to Neneh, not just her biological family but also the family she has chosen to surround herself with.

**War, by Bob Woodward**

Another intriguing page-turner from Bob Woodward. Woodward and his researcher have done a tremendous job of telling a story, making it easy to follow while keeping it interesting. For political nonfiction, Woodward never disappoints.

I've been enjoying a lot of classic horror and some science fiction, the fall months always make me crave unsettling, surreal fiction. Im very open to recs so please shoot them my way if you have any!

The White People by Arthur Machen ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I enjoyed this one a lot, I enjoy the story-within-a-story thing Machen does, but when reading a literary analysis of it afterward, I realized I missed some things. So I intend to do a reread soon.



The Great God Pan by Arthur Machen ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This one was so unnerving for me, but I got the ending spoiled for me when I googled a Latin phrase to read the translation. Google supplied the translation and then spoiled the ending for me! Im still super angry about it, but even knowing the ending, I really enjoyed this read.



The Lost Club by Arthur Machen ⭐️⭐️⭐️
This was enjoyable, a very short and quick read, but I didn't personally get very much from it. I like researching and reading analysis of books/stories after I read them, especially if they're chock full of metaphor and allegory but I think in my haste to get to The Great God Pan I skipped that step for this one. So I definitely owe Machen a reread here!



Such Small Hands by Andres Barba ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This was an interesting premise to me, I LOVE a story about evil children and nature vs. nurture (ask me for recs!!) I was really impressed with how well Barba wrote girlhood, and the 1 versus us perspectives added a lot to the slowly ramping horror. I flew through this one, its a quick and easy read but still very unsettling.



The Dead by James Joyce ⭐️⭐️⭐️
I went into this expecting something else, and so I think it fell a little flat for me. Again, upon researching and reading about the themes and analysis of this story, I realized I missed some points, which definitely affected my opinion of it. I enjoyed the writing style and was very engrossed in the story, but I just expected something else, and so this one missed the mark for me. I'll add this one to my reread list so I can come back to it with a fresh perspective.



The Library of Babel and Others by Jorge Luis Borges ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This book contains 7 short stories (copied and pasted) THE DURATION OF HELL, THE REJECTED SORCERER, THE LIBRARY OF BABEL, THE BABYLONIAN LOTTERY, THE CIRCULAR RUINS, THE CARD-TRICK (verse), and A PATIO (verse). 
I won't review each of them individually because it would take far too long because every single one of these shook me to my core. Borges is, in my opinion, a master. I had multiple points in each story that forced me to pause and chew on it for a while. I did not want this book to end, and when it did, I immediately ordered another set of his works to devour. His work hits the mark for me every single time, its not often that a book can give me the shivers, but the ending of one of them (I won't say which) genuinely made me shudder. I can't say more on this as I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone, but I begged everyone I know to read this! It was an instant top 10 of all time for me. The Duration of Hell was tough for me to get into right out of the gate. It was a bit heavy to start out with and it reminded me of Black Mirror and their first episode being a bit of a turnoff if you are easily shocked, but don't let it deter you from the rest of the stories. This is a masterpiece, in my opinion.



Bloodchild and Other Stories by Octavia Butler ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Octavia Butler is on par with Borges for me, I read this collection just before The Library of Babel, and despite how different the 2 are, it felt like a very natural segue for me. To be fair, I'm currently seeking a specific *vibe* this week versus a specific genre or type of story, but this book hit the nail on the head for me. Octavia Butler is one of, if not the first successful, black, sci-fi author, and she very well deserves those accolades! Her writing is captivating, and her concepts are mind-blowing. I felt that her stories focus on humanity and our resiliance and cruelty and goodness. I found this collection to be so thought-provoking. I'll be reading Parable of the Sower soon, and I can't wait!



The Divine Farce by Michael S.A. Graziano ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I love a story that makes you face the horror of eternity. This book was recommended to me after I read A Short Stay in Hell by Steven L. Peck and was desperately seeking something else that made me feel that same bleak terror of the infinite. I have nothing else to say about this except that it was terrifying and hopeless while being hopeful at the same time. I found myself holding my breath a few times while devouring this one, I couldn't possibly recommend it enough. This one was also an immediate favorite for me!",""

Amazing world building. A fairly unique story that reads more like a historical chronical. The prose was a little difficult to follow at times due to convoluted metaphors and vocabulary.

It could have been a trilogy all on its own, intreasted to see where the remaining two books go.

This centred on politics, not my favourite subject, but the characters were likable and the political stuff wasn't too intrusive. It was interesting.

I do think these books get better as they go on, my running out of steam thought has not been validated. I think that these will be a re-read over time.

Actually, I haven't finished this book yet, but I'm pretty close to the end so I might as well post my thoughts. It's a history book about the leadup to the American Civil War and the assault on Fort Sumter. I like reading about the Civil War, but while there's nothing particularly wrong with the book, history books can be hard to get through because a lot of names, dates, and events are thrown at you at once. It was a big event, and as such, there were a lot of people involved, so it was difficult to mentally keep track of everything happening.

That doesn't mean it's bad, as a ton of research went into it, and I always like learning about historical events. However, it's not the easiest read, and a lot of what is described is more about the logistics of taking over the fort, which isn't as interesting to me as the political conflict.",""

I struggle with stories of people who risk their own bodies by taking on big physical challenges. I am so enraged by the wasted life and vigorous health or even the risk of that waste that I can't muster much sympathy for the derring-doers. I'd hoped this one would give me a little more insight into the mindset of the Everest climbers, the extreme hikers, the bull runners, (*Chris McCandless*)  and so on. The title references the note that Largay left before her death due to starvation and exposure after becoming lost in the Maine wilderness, and the whole book hinted at the pages and pages of journals that she kept. Given those details, I'd hoped to read some of her writing and get a chance to see ... I don't know, some sympathetic aspect of her story. Instead, it seems like most of her papers are kept privately, which I have no problem with, except for the uncomfortable sense that her family was likely not involved in the writing and the letdown when it turned out to be just another exercise in getting pissed about people putting themselves in extreme situations, especially when they are romanticizing the experience and may or may not be fully prepared.

**Ink & Sigil, by Kevin Hearne -** Have previously read this, re-listened to the audio book so I remember the story so far before getting to the new book in the trilogy.

**Paper & Blood, by Kevin Hearne -** Also already read, just relistened in preparation for the new book in the trilogy.

**The Best American Mystery and Suspense of 2024, edited by S.A. Cosby and Steph Cha -** To start with. If you like short stories in general - I can not speak highly enough of the Best American Collections each year in general. I don't have subscriptions to any periodicals - so this collection of the 20 best from this year always makes me happy. If you don't want to get the whole book, but are willing to find one or 2 of the stories - the ones I thought were quite amazing were:

*Just a Girl* by Alyssa Cole which initially appeared in something called *Obsession,* Amazon Originals.

*The Body Farm* by Abby Geni which appeared in *Epoch* at some point in 2023.

*Possessory Credit* by Diana Gould which was in *Entertainment to Die For (*Which I think was an Anthology?)

*With the Right Bait* by Gar Anthony Haywood which was in *Playing Games* (Also an Anthology?)

*Baby Trap* by Toni Lp Kelner from *School of Hard Knox*

*Monster* by Shannon Taft from *Reckless in Texas*

*Unknown Caller* by Lisa Unger from *We Could Be Heroes (*Another Amazon Original)

**The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2024, edited by Hugh Howey and John Joseph Adams -**  As with the Mystery and Suspense, I'd recommend just getting the book, but if you are only willing to check out a few stories- what follows were my favorites:

*Eye & Tooth* by Rebecca Roanhorse from *Out There Screaming*

*Disassembling Light* by Kel Coleman from *Beneath Ceaseless Skies*

*John Hollowback and the Witch* by Amal El-Mohtar from *Book of Witches*

*Resurrection Highway* by A.R. Capetta from *Sunday Morning Transport*

*Ankle Snatcher* by Grady Hendrix from *Creature Feature*

*Once Upon a Time at the Oakmont* by P.A. Cornell from *Fantasy*

While also trying to navigate and figure the fangled experience of being an independent adult with all the things (and psychological pitfalls she suffers from) that come with it.

I rarely read contemporary fiction that isn’t sci-fi so it was a pretty big outlier for me and I wasn’t sure where to go next - if you also like it and have recommendations, I’d love to hear them! I really love how realistic it is in its depiction of a character who has survived trauma. Eleanor gave me more compassion for myself and some of the truly dislikable/antisocial qualities I have developed as a result of my experiences, and gave me hope that I can grow out of them. And also gave me a lot more compassion for and curiosity about other people’s unkindnesses. Really such a great character. ","lszslw9"

A lot of McCandles’ viewpoint and philosophy that gets unravelled over the course of the book I found really intriguing and relatable, but of course you see the tunnel vision and self-centred nature of it at the same time, and Krakauer never lets you forget that this is a path to his death. Apparently the movie, which I haven’t seen, keeps his death more of a secret until the end. Interesting contrast to me between how books and movies tend to tell nonfiction stories?

It's intimate and funny, while tackling the extraordinary scope of the Mahabharata set during India's struggle for Independence. Here, I'm actually bored, because I feel the scope itself had a lot of promise but has been squandered on a rather pedestrian narrative. The magical realism, the setting, the period, the premise: they're all better than the actual story and the text, I feel. Ironically, I got more out of non-fiction history books in the last few years than this book so far, and that's such a shame for someone of Rushdie's skill.","lszz4y3"

It's just some of the reasoning for the motivation of characters and the backstory is putting me off.

Then I’d accidentally read something online that said Trixie was dead the whole time, and felt confused—and I’m glad that wasn’t the twist, because the Daisy one was well laid out, in my opinion. Even at the beginning, when Nana is reading her will, the fact that she gave nothing to Faisy but did donate to charities that Daisy did/would have (forgot the exact verbiage) supported. Reminded me of Anxious People by Fredrik Backman in that regard. The twist with Trixie being a part of it…okay, whatever, sure let’s go with it. Nana being in on it too, I see as an acceptable twist. But then Nana killings herself right then?! And Trixie’s story felt a little unfulfilled—she went from sad(ish) about the killings to being fine, all “I can leave school in a year and live the rest of my short life how I want,” was a bit much for me.
