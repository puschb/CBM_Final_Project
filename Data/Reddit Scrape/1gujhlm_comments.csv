Because I've heard that he writes books so damn fast, that there's supposedly many completed books by him just sitting there somewhere because the publisher finds it more profitable to release a book once or twice a year, rather than how many he has actually finished.

Don’t get me wrong, he writes women better than most, but as a woman I still find some of their actions or thoughts unbelievable. I’m sure the exact same thing can be said about women writers and men. We write best about what we *know*. No matter how much he studies or knows women, he isn’t one. He can’t capture that feeling perfectly. 

He gets pretty damn close and I do applaud him for that, but I also recognize it’s his weakest aspect of his writing. Which honestly, isn’t saying much because even Kings weakest aspects are way better than some people best.","lxv0byq"

King writes a lot and I’ve read most of his work, so narrowing it down to 3 or even 5 is hard for me. So many good books.

My biggest disappointment was the complete cut of certain scenes. What’s really weird is I think the scenes would’ve only contributed to the movie, not detracted from it, so I do not understand Kubricks decision to leave them out. Time? Money? Probably, but bad for the *story*. 

Some things he absolutely nailed while completely failing in others. It’s that inconsistency to the original work that takes away from the experience for me. Sometimes he’s super true to it and other times he couldn’t care less. It’s easier for me, as a viewer, if they pick one or the other and not hop between the two.

So I decide to view them as two seperate entities based on the same series of events. Like two news articles writing about the same thing. Both will get the overall gist, while having the words inside them be much different leading to a different experience.

The book is worth it and you can compare it to the movie if you want, but I’d just go into it like it’s a brand new book you know nothing about.","lxva099"

Dreamcatcher was written while he was under the effects of Oxy… which he was on from his accident. He’s quoted as “not liking the book much”, probably because it reminds him of that moment in his life. Wouldn’t surprise me if he struggled coming off it. A lot of people do.

But that’s also why the book is a little weird, even for King. He quite literally wasn’t in his “right mind”. Inconsistency in his work can often be tied back to events in his life, which I think just makes him human like the rest of us. Writing is his outlet.
