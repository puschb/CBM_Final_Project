I remember B&N ten years ago cultivating a ""Cheesecake Factory for book snobs"" vibes. Now, it feels like a positive, welcoming space for multiple kinds of shoppers. The kids' section is full of color and textures and stuffed animals, as well as books. The cafe has a nice seating area that makes sense with the traffic flow, instead of being jammed into a corner. The board game and nerd shit sections are huge, and obviously curated by somebody who knows a lot about the hobby scenes. Plus, at least at my local B&N, the booksellers are happy and excited to help customers find books.

The store now feels like a place I want to spend time in, instead of a space I aspire to be good enough for.",""

I like to browse things a bit before I go into the store, maybe make sure the store I'm going to has the books I want in stock, and their site is always really slow and a chore to use. Honestly it's probably faster to go down to the store and just check in person sometimes.

Then there's their app which is even slower...and, well. I searched for something the other day, it showed 15 results. I kept scrolling and now there's 30! Cool, I guess more loaded in, app's slow. Then...there's 45 results. And then it sets in that it might just be loading in the same 15 results in a loop for some reason, which it was. Bizarre.

If their app worked better, it'd be nice to have like Target or Walmart or a bunch of other stores where it can tell you based on the store that you're in, what section something might be in. Doesn't have to be granular, just...give me something to work with, BN. The other day I wanted a book that could feasibly be in Psychology, Social Sciences, Self-Transformation, or Self-Improvement (or whatever it was called). Had to check all 4 sections because there doesn't seem to be a way to tell from their current app or website setup what section a book will be under.

All that being said, what they're doing with the stores themselves has been really awesome. When I am in a more browsing type of mood, they're absolutely a joy to walk around in, and I never mind getting lost in there. Big fan of their fancy exclusive editions too, those are nice.",""

I also use them for gifts, they have good Lego selection some not found elsewhere. They also have other nice kids toys, board games and puzzles and good workbooks for summer. I use it for teachers gifts too, usually we do a Target gift cert, but I like to put something cute in w the card. 

B&N got popular when I was in my later high school years. I remember driving up there and hanging out sometimes. It was nice you could sit and read. The one nearest us at the time was 2 story. 

Finally, I also think giving B&N gift cards as part of a gift or the gift itself is great bc it’s a nice luxury to go and shop for a book.

"lxjiqba","DomLite","2024-11-17 03:46:51 UTC","I worked at a Barnes and Noble several years ago, and even then they were floundering. It was constant reshuffling of priorities and product. They were pushing their Nook e-readers heavy, and then they dropped off and started pushing more board games/puzzles. After that they tried more in-store events that never really had too terribly huge of a turn out. Then we started selling vinyl which became a *huge* push, even though they'd functionally abandoned the music and movies section prior to that. And in all of this mess the books were *never* the priority.

I can't help feeling like they're clinging to life because they're the functionally the last chain book store with any viability at all, but as I mentioned, half their push is for non-book merchandise because they know they can't survive on literature alone. The sad part is that they could really go hard on being a sort of ""boutique"" store if they really wanted to lean into the aesthetic that they've always given off. Some of their stores seem to have started going this direction, so I'll give them credit where it's due.

Back when I worked there, the music and movies section was jammed full of stuff that we never sold. Just whole walls of junk. We didn't need a ""$5 or less"" DVD section full of c-list titles and forgotten 90's flicks. We had no business stocking the weirdo random selection of pop rock that we shelved. What we *did* sell was a ton of classical music and opera CDs, plus a handful of the latest releases from impressive vocalists. We also sold a *lot* of high-quality film releases from Shout Factory and Criterion Collection, plus lots of documentaries. Outside of that section, we stocked a ton of basic board games that never sold. We *did* sell a lot of the bigger ticket board games like Betrayal at House on the Hill and the like, as well as lots of 1000+ piece puzzles with high-quality artwork. I kept saying that they should trim the fat and stop carrying the cheap junk that never sold because it just deterred people from looking for something specific in a sea of trash. Lean in to the whole ""high end"" thing. Only sell classical and opera music. Only stock Criterion and Shout film releases, along with the box sets of British TV that you can't find anywhere else. Have a curated display of bespoke board games and beautiful/challenging Ravensburger puzzles. Yeah, it would be more expensive, but people would walk in and go ""Oh yeah. This is *fancy*."" I could talk a film enthusiast into spending a bit more on a premium release, or sell someone on a horror-themed board game that could be played for hours on a rainy night in. I wasn't ever going to talk someone into buying the two pack of Ruthless People and Down and Out in Beverly Hills just because it was five bucks.

They seem to have gone down this route, because the last time I was in one of their stores, they had very few movies, but what they did was mostly Criterion, displayed alongside lots of Vinyl, and very little music, most of which was classical or the very latest releases, as well as lots of high-dollar board games and collectables. It's kinda sad that they *have* to rely on this stuff to keep the industry afloat, but with the advent of amazon and digital books it's just the price we pay I guess. At least they've course corrected from throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, and that's really the best I could hope for.","lxiemrl"

"lxih54v","SlowThePath","2024-11-16 23:45:33 UTC","My sister worked at a small locally owned toy store when I was a little kid and she was a teenager. I was 8ish she was 16ish. We were very close. The owners let me come hang out and play with the toys while she was at work. It was so. fucking. cool. to go spend an entire day at the toy store where most of the toys weren't really packaged, so I could play with whatever I wanted. 

They had beanie babies and I loved playing with them so when I had to have my tonsils out my sister bought me a beanie baby to keep me safe. They let me take it into surgery, or at least they pretended to let me take it into surgery. It just occurred to me there were probably some shenanigans there.

Anyway I started collecting beanie babies and that first one my sister got me, Teal, was always my favorite and he was always the king or the president or whatever. Him or the penguin anyway. So my gym teacher was also super into this fad and when I told her I had Teal she asked me if I wanted to sell him to her. We had traded in the past, I think maybe she was taking advantage of my being an ignorant little kid, IDK though. She told me to ask my parents and have them call her if they were interested, so I did.

Now, this is the part I've been getting to. After the call, my parents had a discussion with me about money and the value of my collection after they called her. She offered me 500$ for Teal. That was an unfathomable fortune to a little kid. That's honestly still a bunch of money to me even now. So I weighed the decision and decided to sell Teal and I honestly feel like that was when my innocence left me. I think the discussion my parents had with me was the COMPLETELY wrong lesson to teach a kid (at that age) as it was very much, ""This is worth more money than the joy you get from it."" which now seems sort of fucked up. 

However, my dad ended up taking the 500$ and matched it with 600$ to buy me a computer which I had been begging for ever since he took me to see Windows 95 at his office. It was probably a good choice in the long run because I've been slightly obsessed with tech my whole life. My interest in technology has brought me so much joy and I've spent a ton of time on it, not playing video games, or watching movies, but actually learning about and messing with technology itself, which is really what my dad encouraged by buying me Maximum PC and sending me to coding camp. I've always been more of a tinkerer than a gamer, which people I've come across generally don't understand at all. 

Now I'm finally going to school to study CS.  Yeah I'm going to school late, but you know, shit happens. Life's strange. Anyway that's the story that comes to mind when thinking about mom and pop toy stores. Places like that (and my loving family) provided a significant, positive, life altering experience. That wouldn't have happened at Toys R Us, so it really does feel like we might've lost something. If you actually read all this, thanks. I don't have anyone to talk to really so I rant like this often. My bad.

EDIT: Thank you guys so much for the nice comments. I really needed some support today and I'm so thankful completely random strangers were willing to say some really nice things to me. It often costs us so little to be nice to people and we never know the difference that can make. Some people have suggested that I buy another Teal and I've decided that after I graduate and get my first job in tech I'll take exactly 500$ out of my first paycheck and buy a Teal off ebay. They don't cost 500$ but I want to pay that price so things really feel like they've come full circle. Thank you again for being so nice. I legitimately appreciate it.","lxibw6v"

I don't even really buy books there often cause like you said Amazon is cheaper, but I'm kinda there for the vibe and sometimes its nice to see the book in person before you buy it. 

Also buying it from B&N in person means you know you're happy with the condition of the book beforehand vs. Amazon who seems to like throwing books and even CDs in that shitty white bag that I'm sure gets dropkicked like 5 times in transit. The other day I bought a CD from Amazon, the case was already cracked when it got here. I returned it for another, the replacement was cracked too.

"lxjusef","pistachiopanda4","2024-11-17 05:18:31 UTC","Borders is still my number one but B&N has stepped up their game recently. It feels exciting to be in a B&N again. Now granted, I live in SoCal so it's always had good traffic. But I remember starting to frequent it as a young adult in 2016 and barely having anyone. It's so different now, the energy is there. There are so many young people who flock for YA books and manga. Many authors will do a reading or signing. There are book clubs and events at least once a week. Many of the tables are more than, oh romance and sci-fi. But like, there will be some for Native American history, a BookTok table (lol), murder mysteries a la Stephen King or Agatha Christie, dark romance, etc. As much as I despise TikTok, damn did it push B&N to innovate in a way that gets people excited to read again.

Edit: I forgot to add, it's not just books. While the kids section and toys are great, if you have a nerdy or geeky interest, you'd be able to find it at B&N. They sell book bundles for series or manga volumes, lots of figurines, DnD has had a huge resurgence so you can get books and dice there, lots of cute plushies.","lximia2"

A while later she reappeared and I asked, ""Hey where have you been?"" and she replied,  ""Oh I was off at college."" So when I asked how that was going she said, ""Great, I just graduated."" My mind was blown when she said that. It had been 4 entire years somehow. It felt like a few months. This girl went to high school for like a year, graduated HS, went to college, graduated and showed back up all the sudden and I was in the exact same place doing the exact same thing every day having made 0 progress. At this point I started applying for every Starbucks I could because they pay for college and I didn't see any other way to do it. I took a big paycut and a demotion and have had to move home with my parents.

"lxk8b94","SlowThePath","2024-11-17 07:19:42 UTC","That would be so cool, but it would be very hard to find her as I moved away from that town 24 years ago and I don't know a single person who lives there any more and even if I did, it would probably be hard for *them* to find her. Even if I managed to track her down, the odds that she still has Teal are very low. It's hard to remember exactly as I was a very little kid but if I had to guess she was into the fad more for the profit than anything else. I *do* remember that she bought all the brand new beanies she could get her hands on then would just resell them to people for more money. She was pretty cool because she barely upcharged for me because she knew I was just a kid having fun with toys. These things were really hard to find and for a couple years a lot of them gained value really quickly so if you did it right, it was profitable. My sister always got a chance to snag the newest ones because she worked at the toy store so she bought me a lot because there were like 5 dollars which was cheap and I believe she got a discount as well. She really spoiled me.

Honestly the history of beanie babies is really interesting to read about if you want to go down a wiki rabbit hole. There is also a documentary about it on HBO called ""Beanie Mania."" It was one of the first collectables to be widely sold on ebay back when ebay was brand new. Ebay suddenly allowed this crazy, large extremely efficient market for beanie babies, that I would guess really spurred the craze on a lot and was part of the reason the craze got so large, and the craze was HUGE. God the internet was such a mind blowing idea back then. Don't get me started on how technology still feels like magic to me. Ugh, ranted again...","lxk5q9j"

Maybe I'll feel different in a few years or maybe I'll forget all about this, but I think it would feel really good to spend that particular money that particular way. Overpaying to match that 500$ I received would really seal in the feeling of accomplishment I hope to get when I graduate and land a job. 

That said, yeah, absolutely LOVE the idea of paying it forward that way. I'm actually not a huge fan of kids, but shit, I could probably figure out a way to give away them some toys or something. Maybe I can find something to give to some kids that might spur an interest in technology. Not sure what kind of things a kid would want that would possibly get them to be interested in tech.

"lxj0g33","DeceiverX","2024-11-17 01:45:27 UTC","Honestly, my childhood experience runs contrary to this during the 90's TRU heyday.  We had two local toy stores in town and not a TRU.   If we were rewarded with a toy, we'd usually go there.

I was obsessed with LEGO and nerf guns--the old fashioned pump air tank ones--as a kid.  Not really anything crazy, right?

These local stores were mostly terrible.  Like 90% stuffed animals and various kinds of balls, play doh, and really retro 70's toys like cap guns, ball-and-cup games, rock tumblers similar craft toys,  classic board games, and just generally stuff that felt more like the stuff your grandparents would get you for christmas than things you really enjoyed.  The LEGO selection was always absolutely pitiful with only the smallest sets and reserved to a single small section of a shelf.  Allegedly based on my mom's stories of my childhood ventures, I was brought there once for doing well in school and was so disappointed I told my mom to save her money so I could get a bigger and better set the next time we went to TRU lol.

Going to TRU was a special treat.  They had absolutely everything in huge quantities in those towering shelves.  It was totally corporate as fuck and not exactly a clean environment from the adult POV, but it was unbeatable from a kid's perspective, because you knew if you were going there, you'd find something awesome somewhere in the store, could ride a cool bike down thr aisles, and/or got to ogle and maybe gets hands on at the really crazy and expensive stuff your parents couldn't afford lol.","lxiiomv"

Another way to possibly get 5% back on instore purchases at B&N is if your credit card has a restaurant category. Usually this is for cards that have quarterly categories. Your B&N store must have a cafe for this to work. Purchases made at the cafe count as a restaurant purchase. Many don't realize that you make your book purchases at the cafe.

Let's take standard 9mm (9x19). 23 cents a round to buy new factory ammo.

I shoot a weekly 65ish round match. And a monthly match at 130-240 rounds. Call it 175.

* (52x65)+(12x175) = 5,480 rounds a year, or $1,260/yr in ammo

That's not counting practice, or fun plinking. Just competition. Add in live-fire practice and you can easily pass 10,000 rounds a year.

And that's assuming a cheap handgun caliber.  If you shoot say a .45 that goes up, god forbid .38 Super Comp you're looking at 60 cpr. If you shoot rifle matches it goes up again. 

Sure people reload those higher priced calibers, but that's time and materials. People who have never gone shooting don't understand how quickly you go through ammo.

Strict-on-sale dates used to be standard across the board for hardcovers and paperbacks, and there were hard lines about not selling them before those dates. After physical media stopped being the dominant force a number of years ago, a lot of publishers stopped shipping books with hard SOS dates and allow retailers to sell them upon arrival (as long as they don't openly advertise that they're selling them early on social media). Whereas before nearly 100% of books were SOS, now it's probably closer to 15%. Only the absolute biggest titles have hard SOS dates, where the publisher will send Barnes and Noble's legal team a writ explaining penalties for breaking the dates. If they do not send a writ, the book is not SOS. 

Barnes & Noble's hardware WILL NOT let anyone ring up a book with a hard SOS. 

Barnes & Noble WILL NOT sell hard SOS books before the release dates. 

Occasionally, publishers will send the writs late and if the books are already on the floor, the company will send notices to all of the stores instructing them to pull them. 

Stores like Target and Walmart are the ones breaking hard SOS dates. Target got fined millions of dollars for selling Iron Flame and the most recent Sarah J Maas before the SOS date.

"lxnt5t1","hmasing","2024-11-17 22:13:46 UTC","The CPSIA (Child Protection Safety Improvement Act) created a set of regulations to theoretically deal with issues with lead in toys coming from China by the mass manufacturers, among other issues.

In theory, these were great - but they were applied BROADLY to the entire toy industry, along with a patchwork of state-by-state ""enhancements"" of these regulations.

These included things like sampling and certification per ""batch"" of toys for chemical composition, tracking numbers on the toys to trace to the batch, etc.

My store specialized, as do many specialty toy stores, in not carrying mass-market toys.  So, many of the manufacturers of these toys were very small companies in the USA and Europe.  

The regulations didn't carve out any provisions for these small manufacturers.

When you are making a batch of Tickle Me Elmo dolls, counting in the tens of thousands, pulling samples and sending them for testing at a cost of about $3000 isn't a big deal.

When you are making a ""batch"" of wooden trucks made from maple, beeswax, and linseed oil, of... say... 40 units, pulling samples and having them tested at a cost of about $3000 means you're out of business.

Add to this, that the lobbyists got a hold of the congress and carved out ""self certification"" provisions for the mass market manufacturers.  So, suddenly, the mass market companies manufacturing toys for Wal-Mart, etc, were able to self-certify, bypassing the ENTIRE issue, and the small companies making QUALITY products were unable to ship to the United States because they already had to comply with the European Regulatiosn (which were more stringent), as well as the US, Washington State, etc regulations - so they stopped shipping to the USA.

Or if they were in the USA, they couldn't afford the testing costs. 

This meant small toy manufacturers were crushed by the regulations that were put in to place to try to check the mass market manufacturers, and the mass manufacturers ""self certified"" if they were over a certain scale - which they were.

By producing unsafe toys, they managed to crush the small competitors in the US market through regulatory pressures.
