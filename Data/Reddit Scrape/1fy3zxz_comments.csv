***The Hero of Ages, by Brandon Sanderson*** (Mistborn 3):

The Hero of Ages is the grand finale of a trilogy that simply captivates from start to finish. 
The series as a whole is an example of how to build a rich and complex fantasy world. With each book, we are introduced to new mysteries and nuances of the world, and in ""The Hero of Ages,"" everything fits together perfectly.
Each character's journey is incredible and well-integrated into the plot, with all of them playing an important role in the story. Sazed's journey, in particular in this last book, stands out with its exploration of Faith.


I highly recommend it! And I´m so excited to read Era 2!


“Faith means that it doesn't matter what happens. You can trust that somebody is watching. Trust that somebody will make it all right.”

***Skyward, by Brandon Sanderson***

A fun adventure, and Spensa is so different from much of what I have read in my life. A great main character!

“You get to choose who you are. Legacy, memories of the past, can serve us well. But we cannot let them define us. When heritage becomes a box instead of an inspiration, it has gone too far.”


Starting today:

**Mayflies by Andrew O’Hagan**

A very sentimental story on male friendship (or brotherhood) and growing old with a soundtrack of 80s post punk and jangle pop - lots of Scottish and British talk and references, since the boys were all punky and political. It was nice and made me tear up a bit at times, felt cinematic, although I think it could’ve gone deeper as a literary novel.

**Small Things Like These by Claire Keegan**

I finished this one in a single sitting. Keegan’s writing really puts you in the setting, it made me feel like I was transported to Ireland in the winter. The plot surrounds an Irish man, husband and father of 5 making a startling and unexpected discovery and grapples with making a decision.

It’s a very short novel, honestly I would’ve kept reading if it was longer.

**The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi, by Shannon Chakraborty**

Super fun read that also explores some deep/dark themes as well. There were parts that got a bit too fantastical for me but overall this book was so enjoyable. 4.25/5

**My Sister, the Serial Killer, by Oyinkan Braithwaite**

I wanted to diversify a bit and read some horrors or thrillers for October. This was pretty meh. It focused mostly on the main character's crush on a doctor (who her serial killer sister is dating) and her dislike for her sister. Then it just kind of fizzled out and the ending was so blah. Braithwaite's prose was quite good though, and I loved the glimpses we got into the sisters' past. I think this needed to be a little longer. 2.75/5

**Assassin's Apprentice, by Robin Hobb**

The first book in both the *Realm of the Elderlings* saga and the *Farseer* trilogy. Really loved the character and relationship building in this one. This is very slow and not much actually happens in it, and yet it never dragged. 5/5

**The Obelisk Gate, by N.K. Jemisin**

Second book in the Broken Earth trilogy. I disliked this so much that I questioned whether I even actually liked the first one. So unbelievably slow and boring. Essun's chapters were unbearable; just info dump after info dump after info dump. The two other POVs basically saved this book although unfortunately Essun's was the main POV. I think I still want to finish the trilogy but it's not high on my list. 2.25/5

**The Shortest History of Israel and Palestine, by Michael Scott-Baumann**. A predictably grim read, but I really liked it.

**Ananis's Gold by Yepoka Yeebo** ☆☆☆

I'd never heard of this story before, and only got this book as part of the story graph reads the world challenge but I'm happy to have come across it.  
  
The story itself is so phenomenal it's almost unbelievable, and reading about how this con unfolded and took on a life of it's own was enjoyable, especially the 2nd half which picked up a lot. I'd be amazed if there weren't a movie made about this at some point in the future.  
  
The way the book is written though isn't great in my opinion. The author definitely allows their own opinions come through strongly, which in itself isn't a bad thing but can be risky if the reader doesn't share all your views. The author does put the protagonist on a bit of a pedestal, which with con men can be tempting as they definitely can be a bit of an anti-hero, but that only really works when those being conned are rich and subjectively deserve it, but this is not the case here so it feels a bit off almost praising him. The writing itself is fine but can be a bit of repetitive.  
  
I really enjoyed the story of this, but not necessarily the book itself, I would certainly watch the film!

**Lessons in Chemisty by Bonnie Garmus** ☆☆☆☆☆

I really loved this book, and I expected to like to from what I had seen but not to the extent of giving it 5 stars. It's really a feel good, triumph over adversity story with some tragedies along the way. As a result on occasion it can feel a little bit contrived, certain things happen at the perfect time to move the plot along but the books so much fun and I was so invested in the story I couldn't care less at the time if it were a bit contrived or not.  
  
The perspective shifted from character to character without it being split into chapters dedicated to each one, this unclear shift of perspective can be dangerous but it's done so well here I never found myself wandering who's perspective I was in. Even when it switched to the dogs perspective for the first time without explanation it was somehow perfectly normal and I didn't question it at all.  
  
I loved every character I was supposed to and hated those that I was supposed to, arguably some of these minor bad guys had no depth but really for their part in the story it was perfect. The pacing I really enjoyed except possibly feeling a little rushed at the end, however I've found when I love a book I always feel it's rushed at the end because I don't really want it to end.  
  
I believe this is a debut novel, so I can't just devour everything else from this author immediatley but i'll be keeping an eye out for more of her work in the future. ",""

**Nicholas Nickleby, by Charles Dickens**

I erroneously thought that *Barnaby Rudge* was the next novel chronologically for Mr. Dickens but it turned out it was this one. Read Issues No. 1 (Chapters 1-4) and No. 2 (Chapters 5-7). Chapter 6 seemingly has almost nothing to do with the main plot of the novel, consisting of two stories told by travelers. I liked the one about the five sisters but the other one did nothing for me. So far I can see some of the same kind of material he would later use on the kind of school that Ebenezer Scrooge would attend as a boy in *A Christmas Carol*.

**Story of a Soul, by St. Thérèse of Lisieux**

And the main character displays many of the gritty imperfections of genuine masculinity, which is common to the author's novels. This story was a bit slow to get started, but once I was about 90 pages into it I was hooked. Ended up reading it quite quickly because it was a page-turner. Glad I read it.

I like the premise of this novel. In the present day, some rich guy creates an almost self-sufficient community that uses only technology from the mid-20th century. It becomes a haven for people who are disaffected by modern technology. The community starts out well but problems eventually arise. The novel is serving me well as a thought experiment, as I try to guess the outcomes of different events, and I spend some time wondering if that's how things would happen if it were in the real world.

**Cowboys and East Indians, by Nina McConigley**, a collection of short stories set in Wyoming.  I've been pleasantly surprised by a couple of them, in terms of the complexity and believability of the characters, and the way that the little details of life out here are portrayed.  A couple of the others have been middling, but still well-written.

**Damnable Tales:  A Folk Horror Anthology, by Richard Wells** (ed.).  So far it's had an excellent selection of stories, but it's been overly focused on Great Britain.  (On the one hand, the folk horror genre in general has historically been strongly tied to rural Britain; on the other, Nikolai Gogol was arguably one of the first authors to write in it, and I know that it's branched out into other cultures a lot more in recent years.)  As it stands, the two that I've liked the most so far were ""Thrawn Janet"" (Robert Louis Stevenson) and ""The Sin-Eater"" (Fiona MacLeod)—both of which, coincidentally, were written in Scottish dialects that you could cut with a knife.

My only other criticism is that, although Wells' illustrations are quite good, the decision to place them at the *front* of each story has spoiled a few of their plots.

**The King in Yellow, by Robert Chambers**.  The whole way through this time, not just the influential horror stories at the start of the book.  This is yielding mixed results:  ""The Demoiselle d'Ys"" was interesting and enjoyable, if a little cheesy, but whatever Chambers was trying to do with ""The Prophets' Paradise""... didn't work.

Circe by Madeline Miller (audiobook). I love the narrator's voice, but it was almost so soothing that I found myself not actually listening to the story,  and it was a bit difficult to get into it. Occasional chapters grabbed my attention. 

My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell. This one was probably a start and finish this week. I feel like I wanted more from the story, but I ""enjoyed"" it. I feel odd saying I enjoyed it considering the subject matter, but fellow book people know what I mean.

A Conjuring of Light by VE Schwab. The 3rd book dragged (and could have easily had 150+ pages removed from the 620 length) compared to the other 2, but I overall enjoyed the trilogy. 

Happy Place by Emily Henry. Decent read. I got through it in a couple of days, since my Libby loan was running out. I don't really like how every book, even fluff books, seem to get longer and longer, but...what can you do.

"lqr6cba","Safkhet","2024-10-07 10:02:42 UTC","FINISHED:  

**Imperium, by Robert Harris**  
I enjoyed the subject of this book tremendously, especially its first part. It did feel like the author drew a line as to how far the real events should be fictionalised and I respect his restraint but, sadly, this made it harder for me to maintain my immersion, as by the time something interesting popped up, the narrative quickly changed to the next thing in the chronology of the events. Still, I genuinely loved the story and the setting.  

**The Wave, by Todd Strasser**  
I was familiar with the subject of the book and have seen the film; however, what escaped me before was the impact the experiment had on the teacher, so it was interesting to have some fresh insight into that part of the story, i.e., how power corrupts.  

**Paingod: And Other Delusions + From the Land of Fear, by Harlan Ellison**  
I didn’t expect to enjoy Ellison’s writing as much as I did. It is dark and disturbing and at times pretty damn questionable yet it seems to come from a genuine desire for discovery rather than some grotesque need to shock and awe. It’s not that I enjoy reading men write violence and SA into their stories but I appreciate when they reveal something visceral of themselves, and Ellison has a pathological need to wear his heart on his sleeve. In that I’m not even sure what I enjoyed more, his stories, which in and of themselves were not particularly consistent, or his personal comments preceding each of those stories. In a way, this reminded me of J.G. Ballard’s comments on *The Atrocity Exhibition*, which (although far less personal) made me enjoy that book so much more.  

**Miss Lonelyhearts, by Nathanael West**  
Referred to by Harlan Ellison in one of his introductions. The premise of an Agony Aunt newspaper columnist’s life unravelling as he gets more and more traumatised by readers’ pleadings for help and advice sounded really promising. And yes, it was an interesting tale, but something was missing… I just couldn’t feel the desperation of the main character, there was no arc. It was chaotic and cynical but aside from a handful of letters/personal stories it didn’t really touch me in a way that I expected it to. Like, everything aside from those letters, felt insubstantial, even the final act was almost like a sidenote, though perhaps that was the point…?  

**Diaboliad, by Mikhail Bulgakov**  
This has been on my TBR for so long I’ve completely forgotten about it, until I saw someone else here pick it up last week. What a fantastic read. Can clearly see some of the elements that 40 or so years later came to inhabit *The Master and Margarita*. The pace of it, the anxiety that you feel for the main character as he raced to complete each and every bureaucratic obstacle was insane. Loved it.  

**Dungeon Crawler Carl, by Matt Dinniman**

Was an easy read with interesting, likable and believable characters. A plot that, although not entirely engrossing, kept me turning page after page. To me, the ending felt mostly dull and abrubt, leaving me wishing there was more to it. The story toggles between two narrators with a connection unbeknownst to them and us the reader until almost the end. I personally wasn't a fan of the author's writing style, although I was engaged enough to press on so as to discover the mystery which leaves you guessing the whole way through. I would give others of her books a try even though I'd rate this one a 2.5-3/5 stars. Still a good enough read. 


Finished: The Only One Left, Riley Sager

Increasingly becoming one of my favorite novelist, Sager's propulsive storytelling shines bright in this one. With a cast of complex and nearly tangible  characters, increasingly wild twists and turns until the very last line and moments of audible gasping, it's a read you absolutely cannot put down until the mystery is finally unraveled. A story unlike others, drenched in mind boggling secrets, Sager weaves a perfect web of a decades old lie so intricate and tragic, it left me breathless until it's jaw dropping finale. As with other Sager books, this is a solid 5/5 stars. A must read.",""

"lqroxip","caught_red_wheeled","2024-10-07 12:45:35 UTC","I started Great Expectations, but since I’m just at the beginning I won’t comment on it until later. All I can see for now is that I like the descriptive writing, but I’m not a fan of the very long sentences. I will see how I feel about that as I go along. 

There’s two other things I read, but they are both long, so they’re each getting their own post. My first book I read was for a different reason and called **Literary Theory: a very short introduction by Jonathan Culler**. This book was an interesting case because it was actually gathering information for my graduate degree. 

I applied for a Master’s in English: literature concentration in mid September. Around the time I first started putting things together in August, I also discovered the school with a possible PhD degree that I wanted. I eventually would like to teach in four year colleges, having a background in education first. However, in order to do that, I knew I needed a PhD. So well I was looking at my masters degree, I started searching PHD programs in my area. I found one about an hour away from my current location with a doctorate in literary theory. However, I wasn’t sure how much I knew about that theory, so I emailed the head of their English department asking for more information. I wasn’t expecting a response back but got a response on Tuesday of last week.

The person mentioned that there would be resources I could look into when I went for my masters so I could get more of an idea of it. I won’t be able to do that until I’m accepted, but she also recommended that book as an introduction and to see how much I really knew. There was a deal on Kindle, so I went and bought it and ended up liking a lot of what I read.

Surprisingly, a lot of it was familiar to me, because I got a basic introduction in my bachelor’s. I found out it was probably one of the lucky ones because most Bachelor’s programs do not teach it (and the book argued for putting it into undergraduate programs in some way). It may have been because I was an English (and Spanish) education major instead of just English, so I know some of my classes were specialized to that. But I don’t remember if that particular one was. It also reminded me of what I am currently teaching my adult students, although it was at a more basic level. There was definitely some things I didn’t know, and I was reading fairly quickly because right now my time is limited (it’s the middle of the school year and it’s pretty busy right now). But that made me feel relieved that I knew at least some of it.

As for the book itself,  it reminds me a lot of How to Read like a Professor. It was really cool because that book was with taught me a lot of what I know about literary analysis and how to use it in the first place. It was definitely more of jargon, and I had to slog through some of it. If I had more time it was in a mood to analyze, I probably would’ve tried to decipher it. I bought it on my Kindle for that reason in case I wanted to go back to it later. It wasn’t very expensive in case I didn’t. The other thing that popped out to me (aside from what I already knew, like what the definition of literature was and the literary canon) was that no one can exactly what literary theory actually is, because there’s so many different definitions of literature and ways both writing and reading can be applied. I found myself agreeing with that, and when I tried explaining to my mom later (we live together and she loves to hear my English stories), I could only explain it as I’ve been doing although much deeper and more professional. so it’ll be interesting if I try to pursue it more. 

I jokingly stated that the analysis of those people did make me look like a Girl Scout, but I’m sure I could write something like that and I’ll get more training to do it in my masters. For now, it actually gave me some rough thesis ideas, but I can’t go any further at the moment. It was pretty cool to get a glimpse into the future by looking at the past, and hopefully it will be a logical step once my education and training continues. I’m looking forward to it if it is!",""

So she jokingly stipulates that she'll help if Ooguma goes out with her. Which as one can imagine, Ooguma more than wholeheartedly agrees to. Thus beginning their sweet at times awkward romance based on a misunderstanding as they basically figure out how to relationship. Kanda especially in that regard.


Well anyways. It's a very sweet and well illustrated story. But unfortunately it is a rather short story.

The level of research here is astonishing, and considering it covers some of the most important events in American history, it's really just the perfect storm of awesomeness if you're a history or political buff.

The short stories contained in this collection do range in emotion from nostalgic to gut wrenching in tone. There's a scene described in 'Rattlesnakes' that is downright the stuff of nightmares. And, then there is the final story, 'The Answer Man' that will surely bring a tear to the eye of anybody over the age of 60. Well, quite possibly, to anyone below the age of 60 as well. I've read a few - but not all - of King's short story collections, and so far, I think this is my favorite.

Anyway, this week I finished **Clown in a Cornfield 2: Frendo Lives, by Adam Cesare** which was definitely my favourite spooky read so far! I just love how good Cesare is at making these books feel like you're watching a 80s or 90s teen slasher. Lots of fun and wish I had more books like this!

Next I started and finished **The Carrow Haunt, by Darcy Coates**. I had hoped this one would be spooky given it was about a house haunted by a serial killer. Sadly it wasn't all that spooky and kind of went off the rails at the end. I previously really enjoyed her Haunting of Ashburn House, so was a bit disappointed that this didn't turn out as spooky.

**Enlightenment, by Sarah Perry**

Published in 2024, this is a fascinating novel about an older gay man and a young girl in a small English village. The man Thomas is a writer for the local newspaper while the girl Grace is a friend he's supported and counseled since her mother died. Thomas has also been drawn into an intrigue surrounding a mysterious 19th century woman with a passion for astronomy. It's a melancholy story with a spiritual quality, told in a Victorian style, and  major themes of friendship, faith, and unrequited love. I enjoyed this book from the first page.

A sorta kinda anthology story collection of dark and at times twisted psychological stories (with some of them being interconnected) within a reality where androids are commercially available products. And therein are the stories of these androids and/or the people that own them for various reasons and uses, or just the people that live in this reality that's reached this level of technological advancement. And like I said, these stories are oft psychologically dark ones. Not to mention it's another instance of showing off how much this author must love a certain kind of fashion. The artistic detail here, especially on the outfits, is indeed quite impressive.


But anyways. I've seen a few other works from this author and I've come to like a lot of this persons works. And this one did not disappoint in that regard.",""

**Shameless: Republicans’ Deliberate Dysfunction and the Battle to Preserve Democracy, by Brian Tyler Cohen**

**From Here to the Great Unknown: A Memoir, by Lisa Marie Presley**

I  was looking forward to reading **From Here to the Great Unknown** from the time its release date was announced. I became concerned when the first page (ebook edition) noted that Lisa Marie Presley’s thoughts would be in one font and Riley Keough, Lisa’s daughter who helped finish the memoir, would be in another font. The one sentence given to each example looked similar. As I continued reading, it became apparent. Not only did the font change, but there were also a couple of symbols to distinguish between each person.  It is noted that Lisa Marie struggled for over ten years with writing her memoirs and only started making headway when Riley agreed to help her finish, just one month before her untimely death. Lisa Marie’s portions were completed mostly from recorded interviews intended for the book.

I got what I wanted from this memoir. Lisa Marie shared amazing stories of growing up on the grounds of Graceland and what it was like to have Elvis as her father. She touched on the day her father passed away and what it was like the days after. 

The time of her life that was discussed in pretty good detail was her dating, marrying, and eventual divorce from Michael Jackson. The MJ era and the death of Lisa Marie’s son, Ben, is where Riley’s contribution shines. She adds so much perspective and insight to how the kids felt about Lisa Marie’s relationship with Michael and gives a lot of background on everything that went on after the death of Ben with her mother. From the sounds of it, Lisa Marie probably wouldn’t have been able to be so forthcoming herself. It was still too raw for her.

The one area I was disappointed with was Lisa Marie’s relationship with Nicolas Cage, which was just glossed over. There was always the feeling that the huge Elvis Presley fan Cage just dated and married Lisa Marie to have the ultimate Elvis collectible, and maybe that’s why it was glossed over. Riley’s only mention was that he would always drive a different-colored Lamborghini whenever Cage came to their house.

**From Here to the Great Unknown** was a quick rainy weekend read. Lisa Marie shares the good, bad, and ugly of her life. Riley does a great job of helping tell her mother’s story.

"lqrp3ob","caught_red_wheeled","2024-10-07 12:46:47 UTC","Also, I read something different, but it’s a bit of an odd one. It’s **Final Fantasy XV Universe. This is a set of stories by various authors but published by the company Square Enix.** What makes this odd is that Final Fantasy usually is a video game series, even though it’s text heavy. However, the series is no stranger to side content from other media, including tie-in novels. 

But the 15th entry is notable because it has it has an entire series of novels that are required to understand most of the game. It also has a bunch of films, an anime, and some now defunct mobile games that can still be read about like a novel online. Most of this content is difficult to access, with some never having been released outside Japan. However, websites devoted to the series have compiled a list of all of the works required to understand Final Fantasy 15 with complete story explanations. This is collectively and colloquially known as Final Fantasy 15 Universe. The original authors are credited and mentioned in the pages where the work appears, but since there are many different authors on a single set of pages, I just thought it would be easier to put them all together here. However, Square Enix is the publisher of the original game and the one that approves all of the works that go with it. So they’re listed here as well. Regardless, since I plan to play Final Fantasy 15 soon and I really like the Final Fantasy series, I decided I would read all that first.

For starters, I would like to smack the developer that thought doing this was a good idea. It was really a mess trying to organize the content and figure out what went where, to the point where the browser I was using was giving me memory warnings because I had so many tabs up trying to read it all (each individual part long enough to have its own Internet pages). It took me several hours to read it, even with just the summaries. It would’ve taken me God knows how many more if I actually had access to the content itself (aside from an abridged version of the game, which is what I plan on playing). But I understand why it happened because Final Fantasy 15 had one of the most turbulent developments ever seen in gaming and they just didn’t have the time to put most of it in. it really does a good job of tying everything together, so it’s a shame that most of it didn’t make it into the final product. But I’m not even sure how many people would have wanted to see that, because it’s a massive amount of text and lore to get through. Final Fantasy has never done anything like this before or since, and it’s obvious as to why.

Otherwise, I really liked the slice of life areas it put into what’s normally a pretty dark world. The extra content allows people to see the various political schemes that would eventually lead to the beginning of the game. It does remind me of Game of Thrones a bit, which makes sense because the next game would be based off of Game of Thrones, to the point where the creators watched it before making it. I also like the character expansions the novels brought, because due to the rushed development, not a lot of characters got fleshed out. 

On the other hand, I have mixed feelings about the conclusion. The original conclusion was extremely bittersweet in a series where the darkest endings were usually just ambiguous. But that ending also made it clear that the evil plaguing in the world was gone for good, so the tragedy the characters went through could never happen again. But the novel content introduced a new ending that seemed like it made all of the characters happy. I know a lot of people liked the end, but it was bittersweet in its own way. It makes it clear someone else has to sacrifice themselves for the world to be safe (even if it’s someone not a lot of people liked), and flat out stated that the world has lost its protectors, so there’s no special power to automatically stop tragedies from occurring again. 

It makes a bit more sense when it was revealed that it was planned for players to choose between these two endings in the game. However, this choice would only be available if they bought extra missions with the original game or paid extra for a special version with these missions already attached (a practice known as DLC). But I’m not sure what ending I would’ve chosen, and either way it feels like someone would’ve been cheated out of the full story. The game itself was not cheap because it was made by a major developer, and the concept of locking a true or a happy ending of a story behind throwing extra money at a game later on is extremely unpopular for obvious reasons. I’m not even sure how well that ending would’ve done, or how many people would’ve even stuck around to see it. I don’t think the original game even did that well, and I know the rushed development was a huge factor. It’s just sad to think of what could’ve been, but never truly came. Regardless, I’m glad I could see all the content, no matter what the form was in.","lqroxip"

When Thomas Harris found out he was going to lose the rights to the Hannibal Character unless he published a book with the character... He had to get that book out real fast. 


I bought it on release in hardcover and there were straight up typos in the hardcover first edition. It was so interesting to read because you can see like first draft turned to second draft changes that he and editors didn't catch before going to print. Like sometimes Hannibal is in Nice or Paris, depending on the paragraph like he wasn't sure which French city to locate Hannibal before going to medical school...


I'm sure the version you've read has fixed those errors but man that book was rushed on a tight as hell deadline to retain the character rights. ","lr6gm3y"

I like the reveal of exactly what made Hannibal lose his goddamn mind and he doesn't even know if it's true or not like some dark twisted internal psyche where you have him go over his entire life remembering everything with the Roman Room technique and that's the excuse for his super intelligence later in life but he can't remember exactly what happened with his sister and the kidnappers. 


Well very Freudian repressed memory lashing out in perhaps the most unhealthy way Possible. 


It wasn't a terrible prequel or failing to meet up to the Character, so I have to give it credit for accomplishing the goal the book was trying to do. 


Then inevitably the writes weren't fully retained by Harris for the character and that's why the Hannibal TV show came into existence. ","lrfte3c"

Of all the criticism I've ever heard for naming characters in books, if that's your biggest problem avoid Russian literature like Dostoyevsky like the plague. 


What I do find interesting though is you saying the pages were hard to read and it took you time to understand them and you found it much easier to read other books. And I'm thinking like is this your first dense book? Like seriously do you think every book is meant for like page turning easy to digest? 


There's a very particular skill to create that kinda work that Tom Clancy or Stephen King create with their works. But there's other books written for a more complicated and dense reading experience. You don't just pick up Proust or Themistocles and expect it to be like Da Vinchi Code. ","lr6ysl9"
