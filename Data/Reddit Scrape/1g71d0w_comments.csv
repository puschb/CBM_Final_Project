Which I kind of had to laugh since, say what you will about the ideology of Strange/Norrell, it at least knew how to use footnotes in a playful, fun way.

I wouldn't say I hated it, but I found it thematically confusing. I kept thinking the magic felt closer to the Information Revolution (rare element + knowledge workers) than the Industrial Revolution (burning hunks of prehistoric logs to boil water), yet the 19th century colonialism was played completely straight.

"lsp4wm5","ITS_DA_BLOB","2024-10-19 15:31:47 UTC","I really hated Babel, for all the points you mentioned. For me it was so disappointing, it has such interesting themes, the idea of the colonisation of language and translation, how capitalism is used as a tool to aid this process. It’s such a fascinating premise that’s wasted. 

Also, the time setting of the novel doesn’t make sense. These are characters from the early 1800’s, but talk about privilege and colonialism through a very modern lens. I kept having to remind myself this isn’t a story set today, it’s set 200 years ago. 

Then there’s the characterisation. The way Kuang writes Letty is almost laughable. She could’ve been an interesting character, realising her mistakes and her white privilege and using this to help defend her friends, but of course, no growth can happen, and she remains almost comically ignorant throughout. Even if the intention was to always show that she would never understand the deep implications of racism and colonisation, it could’ve been handled so much better!

It also felt too ‘personal’. It was like I was reading Kuang’s personal grievances, rather than experiencing the story through Robin’s eyes. It feels simultaneously immature yet mature. It doesn’t fit into YA, but also doesn’t fit into normal fiction. This is made worse with the constant ‘tell don’t show’ that Kuang does throughout. 

Also the fantasy part of the story was so inconsequential. Again I kept forgetting this was supposed to have magic, and had to keep reminding myself. 

If you want a novel that battles themes of colonialism, and has elements of fantasy, read Midnights Children by Salman Rushdie.",""

"lsojuj4","Best-Air818","2024-10-19 13:22:42 UTC","I read a review for it that I ultimately ended up agreeing with after also reading The Poppy War. Basically, it said Kuang limits herself as a writer by containing her stories in 'what she knows' (i.e. academia) and not giving into the fantastical elements of the narrative (the magic systems are very limited, function in a very banal, rational way, &c.). So, in effect, everything in a purported fantasy has to be hyperrealist, which is confounding because part of the appeal of fantasy is a big swing (and occasional miss) in imagination.     

I had other grumbles about both, but considering she's such a young and prolific writer, they feel like small potatoes comparatively. I think both could have been tighter, for instance, that it can be thematically confusing, and that yes, there is a lot of unnecessary repetition, but on a whole, I enjoyed both, particularly their perspective and world building elements. It was a nice change from the cotton candy YA fantasy reads I'm used to finding on that shelf (not a slight, just don't read a ton of popular YA anymore, welcome any recs in this realm that are more thoughtful).      

All said, I think her writing is technically superb. You can see how smart she is page after page, but I think that's the same issue I took with Zadie Smith's Swing Time (and I *love* Smith) -- incredibly smart writing does not make a great book. I hope she and her work continue to evolve, that she thinks 'bigger' if/when she leaves the ivory tower.",""

But I thought R.F Kuang did bring forwards a really big question about colonialism and people of colour — whether they should reject institutions with a history of systematic racism or if it’s acceptable for them to take from these institutions because their ancestors were deprived of the opportunity. It’s a question that goes back and forth between Ramy and Robin that never gets solved because obviously colonialism is bad, but is it bad for POC to reap the benefits of it?

It’s still a relevant topic today, especially since schools like Oxford now have a wide array of student backgrounds, and Harvard implements affirmative action as an attempt to rectify their previous standards for students. Is it okay for POC to accept this? Is it okay for them to attend these institutions, to benefit from the prestige and education that was initially barred from them and their ancestors? Is it okay for them to benefit from the funding provided by individuals who would have never allowed them to step foot in the institution?

One thing is that her portrayal of the Opium War in the Canton area isn't something you read every day in a fantasy novel, and I find her characterisations of despicable and heroic figures quite subtle.

The book is also a thesis on the role of violence in revolution, from hope to nihilistic despair. If you draw the connection of Canton-Hong Kong, what's going on with the city, and how R.F.

There is a deep wave of anti intellectualism wreaking this community and it really centers around the fragility of not being able to handle a critique of classism, racism, or colonialism. 

The book is about a lot of other things: how translation manifests in social relationships; how betrayal arises from a failure of and endeavor to translate not just concepts but feelings; how people sublimate and translate their desires in betrayal of themselves and others; how being an other complicates and compounds your complicity in oppressing your fellow people.

My gripe with the characterisation is it treats the reader like an idiot. Yes we know colonialism is bad, and we know white people benefited from colonialism. That does not mean every single character has to exist as an empty vessel for this message. 

Letty being able to grow and learn could’ve opened up a great conversation surrounding intersectionality, could’ve opened the male characters eyes to the issues she faces as a woman, how male privilege can affect her as well.

I ended up abandoning Kuang's book about halfway through less because I disagreed with its core ideas – translation as power relations is something that, with my coming from a country/language in a relatively marginal position (yeah, yeah, this typically American deferral into personal experience as root of all thought and belief. Just indulge the rhetoric strategy for me please), I find both incredibly interesting and really important – and more because the book felt almost insulting in how much time it dedicated to spelling morals out and how much less time it was dedicating to examining these issues of translation; it felt as though the book presupposed a far less critical reader who wouldn't be able to appreciate the *actual* possibilities of the premise. Though there were brief sections alluding to the domestication/foreignisation strategies in translation (I can only think of one paragraph, in the first 100-150 pages, honestly?), I was hoping to have a stronger undercurrent of Bordieu, examining how even is subtle things like these play into the power relations between the languages and their respective communities, how symbolic (but no less real) violence may be present even there. Have the professors insist on mangling the foreign language as to retain a clear silhouette of the ""sacred"" and ""superior"" English original! Have them intentionally erase meanings from the original to preserve ""naturalness"" in English! Have the professors comparing wordcounts to reinforce that (a practice that extended evem into the early 20th century!!)! Have the students rebel through doing the inverse and pushing the boundaries of the English language! Have them pushing the boundaries of what ""translation"" even is to their ends with the silver ingots! 

And maybe all that *does*, by some miracle, happen in the latter half of the book, but the promise and potential it held in my eyes was deeply eroded in the first half I did read. Kuang is consistently very upfront with the tools she wields in constructing her work, to a point that, during the introduction where she... defends her right to write about Oxford?, it borders on what felt like insecurity. And those tools had their very clear limitations, and those were ones that failed to live up to the heart of the work","lsnect7"

I thought the dawning realization that nothing (and especially nothing in academia/at Oxford) is untouched by colonialism was portrayed in a way that I think a lot of people experience it. I appreciated the daring ending.

That said, the novel sometimes feels like less than the sum of its parts. There's so much there but it seems to me like there's a real tension between the didacticism of the footnotes and more subtle emotions initially experienced by the characters. It seems to me that Kuang did not fully trust her audience to understand exactly how insidious colonialism is and felt compelled to really spell it out. At the same time, she is a graduate of Oxford and wants to revel in the tradition and history of a place she clearly has affection for.

* Have her do the minimum possible to help without actually sacrificing anything herself. So she never outright betrays them, she only helps them insofar as it has no damaging impact on her future.

* Have her more definitively try and help them as individuals, but with no interest in the wider cause. 

**Such a Fun Age** by Kiley Reid dealt with similar ideas in a much more interesting way since the people trying to help the main character, Emira (a POC), genuinely believe they’re doing the right thing, that they have her best interests at heart.

> She wouldn’t have to become the perfect ally, it’s Oxford in the 1830’s. There was no concept of ‘ally’ and ‘privilege’ then. 

yes there was - just because they didn't use the same terms we do, doesn't mean it wasn't there. there were people advocating for rights for people of colour, for the end of slavery, and against imperial wars.

> She didn’t need to be someone who wanted to tear down the British colonial system, she could just learn to look at the other’s perspective, and help them as they are her closest friends.

why would she do this when she was in a system she had grown up in, which had provided her with everything, and most importantly of all, which she had achieved more in than she was ever expected to? 

what possible reason did she have to look at another person's perspective when she considered her own to be so extraordinary? 

think for a second about her circumstances. she wouldn't have got in to babel because she was a woman. but then her brother died, and she got a chance. victoire had to lie her way in, and robin and ramy get in as pets of the english gentry.

letty thinks her way in was because of her value, her worth, but she gets in because her family needs an oxford scholar. which of the others would have made it in because a sibling died? none. 

she equates her experiences with theirs, despite hers being a completely different level, and because her only response to being called on this is to get angry and withdraw, she has no reason to grow and learn. that isn't in her nature.","lsqsave"

Also, I might have missed something (because I was hate-skimming the last third or so) but what did Robin et al's sacrifices accomplish?
