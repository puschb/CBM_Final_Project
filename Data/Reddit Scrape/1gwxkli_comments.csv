My only gripe was that I didn't think July Johnson's parts paid off too well. I feel like we spent so much time with him for not much.

"lycz4u8","Robert165","2024-11-22 03:36:50 UTC","The other books in the series, Dead Man's Walk, Comanche Moon and Streets of Laredo are even better than Lonesome Dove, in my opinion. Well, I haven't read Streets Of Laredo. And, Lonesome Dove is probably better than Dead Man's Walk.

But:

Comanche Moon is probably - the best - book I have ever read. Ever. The reason it is so good is that it takes on an existential or philosophical tone, because it details the events before the lead up to Lonesome Dove but it also tells the story from the POV of many native american characters too. It shows that people from all walks of life and all groups of people, all groups have good people and bad people, hard working people and lazy people, honest people and dishonest people, etc. When you add the stripped down POV of life on the frontier, the conflicts between whites and native americans, and, you include the native american POV, it takes on a universal message. It is amazing writing and a rather profound commentary on the nature of life in general, for all people, from every day and age.

It really is the best book I have ever read.",""

Ever since getting into the Red Dead Redemption universe I‚Äôve been really into westerns and Lonesome Dove was one of my father‚Äôs favorite books so I had it on my TBR pile after he passed last year.

I read the other three books in the series and definitely recommend them. Streets Of Laredo disappointed me some, but it did feel like a fitting conclusion in the way it leaves the characters behind, some with hopeful futures, some with nothing. It‚Äôs by far the saddest and darkest of the three so if you want to leave it at LD you‚Äôll still get a decent conclusion and your heart will remain more or less intact‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôre up for it read Dead Man‚Äôs Walk (the first book chronologically in the story) then Comanche Moon, then Lonesome Dove, then Streets of Laredo. But if LD is still fresh in your head you can skip it and go right on to SoL.

There are books that get their long claws in you so that when they are gone, you just have to sit with this new reality of a vacancy in your life until the feelings settle and you're okay with it continuing only as a memory.

Thankfully with books we can revisit them. I want to try out the audiobook version (and already have it), but I know it won't be the same as the first time and I'm worried that the experience will also subvert the memory I do have.

I mean, with McMurtry, all of them are dark as shit, except the Road, which isn't that bad (Oprah picked it for a reason--his only book with a somewhat happy ending, and I have read them all).

As for McMurtry: His early novels are fantastic, from The Last Picture Show (and its sequels) to Terms of Endearment. And Moving On has a special Place in my heart.

I have nothing new or insightful to say. It's easily one of my favorite books ever. And as soon as I finished it I bought up all of the McMurtry books I could find on my local used bookshop.

McMurtry makes a few storytelling decisions in the other books in the series I find irksome, but they are still all incredible reads in their own right. Streets of Loredo is even more tragic and bleak than Lonesome Dove. And Comanche Moon is one harsh and intense goddamn read. And honestly, it may be LDs equal imo. 

McMurtry is so good at crafting characters you feel deeply for, yet his writing is hardly ever sentimental. It can border on cruel, even. But it never feels like he's being cruel for the sake of it...just being true to the story he's telling.",""

But i came to appreciate it in the later half of the book, when i realized he was basically supposed to be Call with all his cowboy mystique stripped away - a man with stupid dream he himself doesn't really understand who gets almost everybody he cares about killed because he's too wrapped up in his own image of what his life is supposed to be like and doesn't know when to stop.

I think McMurtry did an *excellent* job deflating the image of the strong, stoic, quietly competent cowboy who don't have no time for city slickers and their complications.","lydaq5v"

LD stands head and shoulders above the remainder of the series, which is still excellent. streets of laredo is the next best. i think this is because it's easier to show a character later and add layers than to dial a well established character back into a primordeal version of someone you already know. i admit i never understood call. he always seemed to wrestle with self hatred and needed to always be busy, working toward a goal, to drown out whatever he couldn't stand to think about. i don't think it was ever established, or at least i never parsed, what this thing was. i considered it might be repressed homosexuality, a difficult way to be in that time period, considering mcmurtry's work on brokeback mountain, but i don't have any proof.","lycz4u8"

I agree that it could just as easily be read on its own without any of the others, and stand completely alone as a fantastic read in its own right.

**Streets of Laredo** is good, and provides closure for some of the characters, but I really didn't like some of the things that happened in it. It seems downright mean-spirited in parts, as if McMurtry was trying to stick it to all the people who had been bugging him to write a sequel for years.","lycz4u8"

EDIT/ADD: really, If I could read only 1 of the 4 books, it would be Comanche Moon. The split narrative between the whites and native americans is such a novel, unique approach,,,, it really is the best book I have ever read.

The thing I loved about reading them in order is that it essentially creates an epic that spans the entire adult lives of the characters. You see how and why they became the people you meet in lonesome dove. 

Only drawback is i found streets of Laredo to be a letdown after how excellent lonesome dove was. Nonetheless, it capped off that epic story and I‚Äôd be annoyed if I didn‚Äôt have that closure","lyd9bus"

They're all exceptional but Lonesome Dove really is its own thing. The rest are just building out the characters you've come to know through LD and giving them a bit more nuance.
