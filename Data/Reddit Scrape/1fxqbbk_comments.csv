"lqoim2x","MrPuroresu42","2024-10-06 21:25:47 UTC","Always felt like *On The Road* can be seen as a time capsule of that generation of guys growing up in post-WW2 America and also an  encapsulation of the Beat Generation in general. 

But yeah, lot of those guys were so far up their own asses although still fascinating, imo.",""
"lqogfah","The_Ashen_Queen","2024-10-06 21:13:52 UTC","Read it when I was 19 or 20 and it was my favorite novel for about a decade or so. I think the sense of realistic adventure was a lot for my young brain.

Just reread it last week at 36 and I’m not sure if I can even say that I like it at this point. 

The book begins with the narrator defending his buddy Dean, claiming that he was ran out of town for hitting his girlfriend, something the narrator is adamant that he didn’t do. Then we spend a couple years watching Dean hit his girlfriends. 

And by the end of it all, Sal loves Dean more than ever.",""
"lqoetla","Hungry-Ad-7120","2024-10-06 21:05:10 UTC","I finished it after about two weeks give or take, I liked the premise of it as other people stated. I bought a collection of Kerouac books on sale at Half Price and managed to get through On the Road. I think if I was younger and a little edgier, I would’ve enjoyed it more.

And yeah, the guys are really sleazy. Like they’ll get jobs and start working, and it felt like once he’d settled in somewhere and it was starting to go kind of “good” for him he’d sabotage himself. 

I watched a few interviews people had with him and he’s defenitely an odd bird.",""

But as I kept reading I saw Jack you know ditches his family and just kind of f**** around across the United States doing speed smoking weed. And then to know that Kerouac died in his forties because of cirrhosis he was romanticizing a lifestyle that was exclusively destructive. It's not even his best book. I read a few of the other ones they are much better",""

"lqogw3x","PeteForsake","2024-10-06 21:16:26 UTC","It's not an easy book. Like a lot of revolutionary literature, it has been copied and parodied so often that it is hard to read it with fresh eyes. This might be why it is so beloved of people like me who read it first as a teenager, and I'm pretty sure that if I read it for the first time today I would find it tough going.

It's supposed to be a bit like jazz, repetitive but building new variations with each repetition. Kerouac took notes throughout a couple of years of his life, then wrote them out on a massive scroll of paper with no breaks and no attempt to make it easy to read. The idea was to present a novel that felt closer to real life - raw and scary and mundane and sad all at the same time, set to a musical rhythm.

This was part of the Beat Generation's attempt to kind of pull America out of its complacency and generate a counter-culture. On the Road and [Howl by Allen Ginsburg](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl) are considered the two most significant works of this group, and have been hugely influential on just about every ""alternative"" artist since.

It might be best just to read it in bits and pieces rather than trying to get through it in one go. It's experimental and not as polished as a modern novel, but each individual scene is good when taken on it's own. It's also a book of its time, and the casual misogyny is a bit jarring to the modern reader.",""

It’s subjective, and I have close friends who love him, but On the Road and Dharma Bums are particularly annoying.

Vagabonding, drugs, laying about… all cool. Down for it, get it, participate. 

It’s that he portrays what is (imo) a morally and intellectually neutral lifestyle as if it has intrinsic superiority. I’m begging for SOMETHING. Defend it, mock it, do both. Lean on absurdity, surrealism, empathy, idk.

"lqpd5uv","Mountain_ears","2024-10-07 00:28:39 UTC","I read it in high school and loved it. It was right in line with the teenage rebellion and search for alternative lifestyles I was going through having been raised primarily in the Midwest. 15 or 20 years later I picked it up again and thought to myself ""wow these guys are kinda sleazy and all of this feels a little pretentious"". 

I don't think it's bad, but I think it's ""importance"" is embedded in the time it was written, and the individual reader's life experience when it's read. A lot of the concepts from the book are a lot more mainstream than they were when it was written, and the novelty of the ""going against the grain"" loses appeal with age and life experience.",""
"lqon7td","Zestyclose-Coffee732","2024-10-06 21:51:12 UTC","I couldn't get through the misogyny.

I closed the book and put it down forever. 


I know that literature has context, but I also curate what goes into my brain to an extent. And I have complete distaste for misogyny, very little tolerance for it. I put Dune down in the first chapter for similar reasons.",""

I certainly don't think you're the only one. It's probably one of those books where it only really hits for people in a certain phase of their life, but when it hits it *REALLY* hits. Catcher in the Rye being a book I think suffers from the same problem, albeit for different reasons.",""

Especially by the time he was writing ""On The Road"", he was experimenting with a literary form intended to be heard as much as it was to be read, inspired by jazz and contemporaries like Ginsberg.

I can’t imagine much ppl younger than 40 having any kind of attachment to this book. There’s a comment in this thread talking about feeling at ease not reading it because it has misogynistic content.

The characters themselves are self absorbed but the book seems aware of that, especially by the end, they are lost and the lifestyle doesn't seem like something the book is promoting in any way regardless of the cultural memory of it. It's more about the dissatisfaction with what they are running from and what they are seeking than an actual journey towards anything.

The problem with Keruac is he's not a great writer or a particularly good thinker either. So it's less that the characters are terrible people than it is that it's a terrible book if that makes sense. Capote wrote a great book about terrible people. So did Burroughs, and Burroughs was a terrible person himself. This is the problem with people saying you have to view things in their time as an excuse. My problem isn't that they are terrible people according to standards now or then, that's irrelevant. The problem is that the book doesn't say anything interesting about them, it's like we are supposed to be equally as unaware as they are and take their version of events at face value which makes no sense.","lqov95y"

It makes no excuses and doesn't necessarily wallow in any kind of anti-drug statement, but it doesn't glorify it either. It's bare-bones, the author is exposed, and the vulnerability and downsides of addiction come through in a more understated way. Half of Queer is just some weird celebration of yage and his obsession to obtain it. I found the whole book to be offputting in tone and plot.","lr1eht5"

"lr3r93q","Deleted","2024-10-09 15:27:18 UTC","Both Junkie and Naked Lunch show the gritty downside of addiction. What I'm saying is Queer shows what the addict is like when he's sober and away from the addiction, long term- that's what I meant by flipside. He's a miserable lonely person with a giant hole that he is maladaptedly trying to fill with things that do not exist. This is the case with the drug theyre searching for, the relationship he tries to force, the adventure he attempts to have, etc.","lr3e5jg"
