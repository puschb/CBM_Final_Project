We can talk about it in all kinds of -isms and dress it up in more formal language, I often do myself in online discussions.

But that's why he was so wonderful because he broke it down and expressed it so simply:

The flip side is translations. For example, Don Quixote was translated in the last ten years, for the millionth time, but by Edith Grossman, who NAILED it. Best edition I have ever read. Same with (also 10 years old now) War and Peace. So, while public domain, and Penguin, ain't the publisher in the above novels, a good translation is often better than the originals that came out when the books were released.

"lvroyp4","Censing","2024-11-06 19:41:46 UTC","I do agree, I tried Guards, Guards! and gave up, the same with Small Gods. Then I tried Going Postal and absolutely loved it, I'm currently reading (well, listening to the audiobook) the direct sequel Making Money. I'm very fussy about my books even though I love fantasy (gave up on Godkiller, didn't care for Dungeon Crawler Carl, and I have no idea what the hype with Brandon Sanderson is his stuff is so boring), so I'm super glad I stuck it out with Pratchett, it's definitely been worth it already.

The great thing about Pratchett is, although Discworld is one universe, there are many books you can start from. I might give Mort a go next, since that's the starting point for the grim reaper character from what I've heard, very excited!","lvqjyv4"
"lvqrdox","data_ferret","2024-11-06 17:09:53 UTC","This has been a matter of spirited discussion among Pratchett fans for decades, to the extent that his Wikipedia page shows an image of one of the best-known [Reading Guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld#/media/File:Discworld_Reading_Order_Guide_3.0_\\(cropped\\).jpg).

I have no idea how other people encounter the novels when they read one strand of narrative (like the Watch books) separated from the larger world. I started on Pratchett in the 90s and simply read the books largely in publication order (other than the final book, which I have not been able to face to this day). I think I read a couple books out of order early on, but then I circled back and started at the beginning. I tend to think that one should read the Watch, the Witches, and the Death books together. The world is much richer that way. But starting with *Guards! Guards!* is a perfectly fine approach to the universe and is your most direct path to *Night Watch*.","lvqndze"
"lvquk86","FustianRiddle","2024-11-06 17:24:06 UTC","I think the thing to remember is that the Discworld books aren't necessarily a series in that you need to read them all in order. While each book builds the world they're often self-contained enough that not reading the previous books is fine.

I'd recommend trying out a few of the different character books and see which one(s) you want to follow. You have the wizards, the watch, the witches and the ones who got written about the most. The gods have some  books (I am a big fan of The Hogfather and think that's a pretty good introductory book) too. And there are the Moist books. Tiffany Aching books are good though I think more of a ya series that takes place in that world iirc. 

Basically find the characters you want to follow and follow them. I wasn't a huge fan of the wizards books and ended up leaning heavily into the watch books. I thought they were funnier, I liked the world through their eyes better, I liked the characters a lot. The gods and witches are tied for me. 

Really there's not a tried and true method. Pick up a book and read it. If you like the style of writing but aren't into the characters or plot, then try another group of characters.","lvqndze"

"lvrl40z","EmmaInFrance","2024-11-06 19:24:18 UTC","I'm like you, I started with a borrowed copy, from my then best friend Steve, of Sourcery, in 1990. It's still on my shelf, sorry Steve, but also thank you, so, so much!

I then went back, bought and read the few earlier books, and his other early novels including Strata, and then started buying those that had came out after Sourcery, until, Reaper Man came out, which was the first one that I was able to buy when it was published.

After that, I just bought them and devoured them as they came along. Eventually, from Jingo, I was pre-ordering the hardbacks.

I was already a dedicated SFF reader. I was already ready the fantasy of the time, and not just the good stuff that's still popular today. I was already familiar with many of the tired tropes and the level of sexism, especially. I had also read some of the other humourous fantasy with Josh Kirby covers that was popular.

It feels very different reading a book in the year it was written to reading it 20 or 30 years later, it creates a very different context. 

Sir Terry's writing was fresh and novel in the 1990s, and it continued to be so throughout his lifetime.

It may not feel as fresh to a young adult reader in late 2024, but that's because they now have the privilege of reading novels written by an entire generation of authors who have been inpsired and influenced by Sir Terry's writing, empathy and compassion for humankind.

As for where to start:

A lot of people like Small Gods as an early jumping off point, especially if they're atheist or agnostic, or even just not Christian.

It's early enough that there's not too much worldbuilding from earlier books that you need to know to enjoy it, and it's also fairly standalone in terms of the main narrative strands.

But it's also just far in enough into the series for Sir Terry to have found his feet and be comfortable in his writing.

If you're a goth, then Pyramids is a fun jumping off point, as are Mort and Reaper Man, which feature Death.

Christmas is coming, so you could also try Hogfather. There will be characters from earlier books, but that doesn't matter because it's the story that matters.

You can go back and find out more about those characters later.

Equal Rites and Witches Abroad are pretty fun, too.

They're very early on, but I think that the lighter, earlier books can be an easier start for some people.","lvqrdox"

Damn, I haven't read that but was planning to. However *Snuff* was serious disappointment... (in fact, I have absolutely no recollection of anything in it, except that disappointment). Maybe I should just skip *RS* and just remember fondly his earlier works.... (I wasn't fan of *UA* either, but then again, not fan of sports anyway)","lvrc60h"
