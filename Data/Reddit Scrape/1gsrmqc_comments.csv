I ended up borrowing it from a friend and we actually went to go hear Art Spielgelman speak and it was really interesting to hear about his career and everything. Had the book not been in the news I probably would have been oblivious. This was a few years ago, but he did mention that after the discussion of banning it the sales were higher and I had noticed the public library suddenly had a lot of holds on the book.

I do think the discussion of banning a certain book can lead to curiosity and may actually get people to read it.

I don't support books being banned, but I do think there are some books that don't belong in schools. I had a few friends get really into Ice Planet Barbarians and I read one and it was enough for me. I don't think a child should be reading that but if adults enjoy reading trashy books like that then more power to them. The public library can still have them, but there are some books that are pretty much smut or whatnot and children don't need to be reading those or have those in the school.",""
"lxgkwld","TeddyJPharough","2024-11-16 17:27:20 UTC","I think the reasons behind book bans are often hidden behind doublespeak and misinformation, like exaggerating the sexual nature of books about gender or misrepresenting books for BIPOC kids as ""anti-white"" when that is not the case. For sure, I'd believe *some* books have these problems (there are crazies of every opinion), but I think most books should not be banned. Rather, we should teach our children how to question what they read and how to decide for themselves what to think. At a young age this clearly takes a lot of guidance, but hiding ideas from kids will only set them up for encountering those ideas later without context for how to engage responsibly with those ideas. And I'm not advocating for full-on sex-ed in grade 2, but I reeaaallly don't think that's actually a problem.

The now-defunct White Bird Publications released the first two novels of my series in 2022. Unfortunately, this small press was essentially a one-person operation (with various editors working freelance), and the publisher dropped dead (heart attack). She also died intestate, and it took me many months to recover all my rights.

I got the paperbacks back on Amazon and Barnes & Noble uneventfully, and began with Kindle Select on Amazon. After some months, I decided to ""go wide"" through an aggregator. To my horror, I found that all 13 or 14 of the aggregator's retailers, including Barnes & Noble (who were still selling the title in paperback), banned the work on the grounds of ""inappropriate content."" 

Of course, I consider the works literary, and they are definitely not pornographic (despite a few colorful scenes).  Moreover, as an ""unknown"" author, I am quite sure 95% or more of my digital sales will come from Amazon, anyway (as is the case with other titles). However, I must call this perverse decision to the attention of colleague-authors, adding that the far more perverse material of the Marquis de Sade sells virtually everywhere. So, too, does the marvelous film by Pasolini: *Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom --* a work in which the victims are forced to eat excrement, have their genitals burned, their eyes gouged out, etc.

I also remember going into Boarders and checking out some of the romance books with Fabio on them and reading some very graphic scenarios around that time as well. I also helped a friend during high school hide their more erotic books at my house from their very religious family because they knew they would be in some serious trouble if their parents found out. What I'm getting at, is that parents can try all they want, but kids are going to get their hands on the books they want. It's even easier with used book websites and active lists telling us what books are being banned and why. 

Do I believe that young children/early teens should not be exposed to some of the more graphic scenes we read about in romance books? Yes, but I'd honestly rather them read about a natural human act involving (hopefully) consensual feelings than watch some rage induced violence on TV. I mean, I remember my parents telling me that letting my youngest sibling watch Chicago, RENT, and Moulin Rouge at age 10 was ""inappropriate"" but they would let them sit in on their TV crime dramas. 

The censorship around sex and the exploration of sexuality is, and probably always will be, a problem in this country, it's a really difficult thing to fix, and I don't have the answer.

But what is happening across these schoolboards is NOT the careful scholarly curation of appropriate materials, but instead an insidious and blatantly anti-intellectual movement in our most important institution for learning.

The process of selection for books removed from public grade school libraries (as you say, we should admit they may still be freely found in bookstores and most public libraries) has been wholesale co-opted by ignorance and prejudice from small-minded (though perhaps well-meaning) parents who have read NONE of the books they declaim as immoral as well as complicit schoolboards and politicians.

Just take a look at some of the books being removed.  This isn't the case of professional librarians debating about stocking McCarthy or GGM's ""Memories of my Melancholy Whores"", or any number of works that might expose kiddos to gruesome or obscene material and themes they might not yet be equipped to process.  They are banning the most mundane stuff that deigns to represent any uncomfortable/underrepresented parts of society.  Books that deal with perspective and struggles around sexuality and a history of racism.  Mediocre romances and fantasies with a hint of queerness, and once speculative fiction too close to home.

When you look at the actual books being ""banned"", this growing movement can be plainly understood as less a means to protect impressionable children and more a way to calcify existing prejudices.  It is not outright censorship, but it has the exact same goals.","lxgylcp"

Parents can do that in the privacy of their own home, but not in public schools. Public schooling is a government institution that's meant to serve the needs of the broader community/country.

But while they may have the same headline, each of those cases is different. Removing a book from a curriculum happens all the time, and may not have anything to do with the book's merits.

The problem happens when parents, or worse fake parents from groups like MFL, take that job upon themselves to not expose everybody's kids to something they deem unobjectionable (also, ""objectionable"" happens to mean ""different"" way too often in these cases).

If the issue is parental choice and awareness of what their kids are reading, then I'd be fine with school librarians requiring parents' permission before certain books were checked out for students below 17 or 18, for things that are overly gruesome or lurid in ways that can traumatize or desensitize. But when we say ""there are certain topics parents should be choosing whether to expose their kids to,"" those topics move very quickly from pornography to things like race/racism, homosexuality/homophobia, gender, and unsavory histories. Some students don't have a choice in whether or not they are exposed to these topics, and it's not fair *to those students* for their classmates to have ignorance towards them and their identities chosen for them.","lxgylcp"

I think that’s what it should be, not individual parents. If a parent points something out and they’re correct that it’s age inappropriate, then the school board could look into it.","lxi7j62"

All the books that were 'controversial' were on our bookshelves.  He went out of his way to teach all the books that other teachers didn't want to teach in their classes.  He was a firm believer in teaching his students to read and decide for themselves about a book's content.  Anytime a parent complained, he simply asked them if they had any confidence in the intelligence of their child.  To the parents who said no, he asked them to transfer the student out of his class to a remedial English class.","lxhf7as"

I was a staunch defender of Harry Potter to church friends during that time and think it's horrible to criticize books without knowing the content.

ETA: I don't remember the name of the first.  The second is listed by the ALA as the 2nd most challenged book in 2023.","lxhhnu2"

"lxrftun","carolinallday17","2024-11-18 14:45:02 UTC","Doing a similar thing to the MPAA, rather than having a separate body. Like how there's a difference between a movie that's rated R for violence versus nudity, language, drug use, etc. I think the MPAA's system is fairly silly, but it does provide a blueprint for how using a system of content warnings or alerts could be helpful to a good-faith cause of curation.

Whatever the case may be, though, that's much lower priority to me than letting librarians and teachers do their jobs.","lxrbhgh"

Let me be clear: I think we should hire trained media specialists/librarians and then trust them to do their job. They curate collections - I don't think anyone wants Stephen King books in an elementary school library, or Sara J Maas in a middle school. I think that books like GenderQueer or Let's Talk About It SHOULD be available as resources. I say trust the trained librarians to make that choice and decide on which books belong and which dont.","lxgpxj0"

"lxmfl5z","KatrinaPez","2024-11-17 17:48:03 UTC","Also it depends on what the objection is.  For example someone complaining that Harry Potter is demonic because they heard something about Dobby could then read the book and find out that Dobby isn't a demon.  But if the objection is sexually explicit content, if one reads an excerpt that is sexually explicit then that objection is justified.  Reading the rest of the book will not erase the explicit section.","lxi2bzc"

2 Samuel 13:12 describes a brother raping his sister while she pleads with him to stop.

In my NIV Genesis says ""lie with."". Judges says ""raped"" and ""abused."" 2 Samuel says ""raped."" Ezekiel is the only one with graphic details but it says ""defiled herself,"" ""genitals,"" and ""emission."" As for context the prostitute is an adult.

The objection I have for the second book is with very specific anatomical and emotional details of a grown man raping a minor.  It describes the act in great detail using today's common terminology.  As I said it was deemed inappropriate to be read aloud to adults in a public government meeting or to be published in a newspaper (which certainly allows words like ""rape"").","lxjmbig"
