It kills off the main character to a random mook as well as killing off the fan favorite character. Several other up-and-coming characters who were children of the OTHER main character were killed off before the novel starts. It prominently shoots down an interesting character theory that the authors themselves had advanced nearly a decade earlier (Raistlin had a daughter), and just majorly upends the world.

Apparently, it was written because the producers of the game world for the actual D&D tabletop system wanted to shake up the setting and revamp it, and so they yoinked the original authors back to help them do it. According to the Wikipedia entry, one of those authors doesn't even consider the book canon.

>The many character deaths in the book brought the Dragonlance series to an apparent ending point, which was resolved by taking the world into the Fifth Age, the Age of Mortals. That in combination with TSR's change in the accompanying game rules ""ended up splitting Dragonlance fandom"", according to Weis.

1. YA dystopia boys trapped in a weird maze and oh no suddenly a girl?! Also there's monsters?! Is WICKED good?! Fun, interesting, let's find out why. Even that Thomas and Teresa were creators would be a cool twist. Just with a BETTER REASON THEY'RE ALL IN THERE. Even if the reason is like ""lunatic billionaires are just fucking around"" a la squid game. Who cares. What people like most about the series is the characters anyway, so people would still like it. Could still have WICKED as basically the same, the other maze that's all girls could also be revealed, maybe they have to work together in a mega-maze in a later book? Idk james dashner they're your books you do it.

2. Sunflare destroys a bunch of the world and then some scientists are like ""we should release a plague about it"" and everything gets much worse? Now people are anger-zombies and also most of the world is a desert? Fun! The hubris of man! The fear of random sun-based destruction! Even having some of the characters being immune and some people (probably those same scientists) chasing them down and maybe they can go live in secret-there-are-still-trees-here land. \\[Character death because they're not immune\\] could still happen, and be really tragic. We could still have that spin off short story that's just about them and what they got up to, which I liked.

See how these could be really good books if they were two separate books/series.

Idk but then I read The Maze Cutter (basically book 4 set many years after the trilogy) and its absolute dogshit, truly unsalvageable. So now I feel less passionate that they would've been good as two separate premises.","luske6i"

From the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant):

>Conversely, in 1986, [David Langford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Langford) published an essay by [Nick Lowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Lowe_(classicist)), in which Lowe suggested ""a way to derive pleasure from Stephen Donaldson books. (Needless to say, it doesn't involve reading them.)""[^(\\[3\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant#cite_note-3) This proposal involved a game he called ""Clench Racing"", wherein players each open a volume of the *Chronicles of Thomas Covenant* to a random page; the winner is the first to find the word ""clench"".

"lutuerf","DonkGonkey","2024-11-01 08:46:50 UTC","They’re talking about the sequel trilogy that released a couple years after the first 5. Gaiaphage asteroids fall to earth after the FAYZ ends and a bunch of people get transformation powers and have big gory fights just to have them. Not as good as the originals but they’re dumb fun. This is how the end though (it’s worse than OP described):

>!Whenever the main characters use their powers/transform they feel these “dark watchers” observing them. This really bothers them at first but it kind of takes a backseat as the series goes on and it’s assumed that they’re the same alien species as the gaiaphage, or its creators, or something. In a way that’s true. At the very very end of the last book in the trilogy, after the villain of the week is defeated the two main characters (basically stand-ins for Alex and Astrid) are contacted by the dark watchers, and enter the astral realm or whatever to talk to them. The watchers are older versions them, from the REAL world. They’re incredibly successful, world-renowned, genius scientists who have created a perfect simulation of human life basically just to fuck around in; drop an asteroid, make a dome, give people powers. The entire series, including the Gone books, is fake. It’s a game of The Sims where your Sims can think and feel pain and they actually go through deep emotional trauma when you remove the pool ladder while their little brother is swimming. The demented scientist versions of themselves give the main characters a choice: they can either keep living, knowing that they’re not real in any way at all and don’t have any control over their lives, or they can decide to turn off the simulation, essentially ending humanity and life as they know it. Their group ponders this and then the book ends lol!<

The rest of the book is a note from Michael Grant that basically talks about how he and his wife had a hard time ending Animorphs, but they were always so impressed with the creativity and devotion of their fans that he decided to leave this one open ended to encourage fanfiction and deep thought (animorphs is known at this point more than anything else for having a pretty mature and frank depiction of war for a shitty scholastic kids book) that he knows his fans excel at. It’s a sweet message if not bizarrely misguided.

I will not lie to you. I love this ending. It felt like getting punched in the gut and suffering brain damage at the same time reading it, but it’s so funny and bizarre that it’s stuck with me for the like 7 years since HERO came out. Gone always toed the line between YA melodrama and delightful ultraviolence and this is neither of those things. It’s a really good joke","lutqw23"

"lussjzh","Mitch1musPrime","2024-11-01 02:34:45 UTC","A decade ago, I was firmly on the hater side. But as I’ve gotten older and involved in a lot more shit, I get it. He doesn’t actually owe us anything. Not really. It’s his story, his characters, his life to live and his time is running out.

Plus, after watching his moves throughout those same years, it’s clear to me he’s much more fulfilled to be an instrument of uplift and creativity to others. He’s edited a ton of anthologies. Worked as a producer on numerous other projects. Helped put together the super dope Meow Wolf projects that started in his hometown of Santa Fe. Run film festivals at his local theater. Contributed to local art scenes, generally as adviser/mentor/financier. He travels to cons and supports other writers/artists in addition to meeting his fans.

Dude lives a life of service to the arts and what? We fucking hate him for not finishing a book?

I don’t honestly believe that many of the events of the last two seasons of the show will come even remotely close to his planned conclusions, and that’d be fucking weird and difficult to manage my feelings about as the original author. Every word will be measured and weighed against that show, and there’s no fucking way he won’t feel it.

The fact that he created the initial WILDCards sandbox and then passed it on to then hands of other writers tells us that he struggles to believe he can honestly produce a closed story that he feels confident is worthy of publishing and praise. And there again, that lengthy ass series of books is another example of his uplift, too. A bunch of new writers got there earliest cracks at publishing, *with fucking dust jacket credit unlike other series that would have made them ghost writers*, thanks to the space Martin made for them.

Now, I refuse to participate in hate for him. Meanwhile, he told us a long time ago he’d not be offering any updates until the book was finished and ready for edits to publish. He made that update a few months ago, and this time I believe him. It’ll be here next year.

There’s a lot about the final book I dislike - killing off multiple major antagonists in really disappointing ways, the whole author self-insert jag, and the way almost all the protagonists exit the story.

And we know humanity did survive in some form because the framing device is human Archeologist 15,000 years into the future of Emperor of Dune universe finds the Journals Leto left. 


The last Frank Herbert Dune introduces some non human entities that look like humans that both have the Future Sight and are surprised to see a human and he's able to escape and they've never seen a creature evade their capture and sight before. 


We never get an answer for what they were in Frank's writing but best guesses are Titan Artificial Intelligences that escaped the Butlerian Jihad and went to the farthest reaches of the universe far away from The human Empire. Or straight up Cthulhu old one Aliens. All we know was that their plan was to capture and vivisect the human to figure out how it was immune to the sight.

I think I initially didn't like the ending because they all die, but when you think of Trillian and Arthur's survival as dangerous to the fabric of spacetime, you understand why the universe puts them back on Earth just in time to be destroyed by the Vogons.

He had never planned on being a novelist. He wanted to follow the career trajectory of his hero John Cleese --ie Cambridge Footlights review=>radio=>television=>movies--  and had been trying unsuccessfully to get a HHG2G film made since the late 1970s. Being an author was just a accident that happened when Pan Books approached Adams and his friend John Lloyd about novelising their hit radio serial. 

Then computer text adventure games came along and Adams became so engrossed in writing the HHG2G game that he didn't make a start on So Long and Thanks For All the Fish until his editor moved into his spare room after the deadline had been extended multiple times. 

According to his wife she returned home one day during the writing of Mostly Harmless to find her husband in such a state pleading, ""I don't want to do this any more.""

Even if he never finishes Winds of Winter abd Dream of Spring, or finishes them poorly, are you going to tell me his legacy is going to be anything less than as an utterly indescribably *massive* net positive for literature (and particularyl sci fi/fantasy)? 

Hell, if he wrote the first 5 books and retired I'd be glad to have come into contact with his work just for their being the basis of the first 4 GoT seasons. No artist can realistically ask for more than to inspire and deeply affect millions with their work, particularly with its unique quality. Nothing else quite hits you emotionally the way GoT does, because very few writers are willing to hang true suspense into their stories, and fewer still have the chops to build a world and characters a tenth as dense and ibteresting as him.","lussjzh"

And it’s just so unsatisfying to have to headcanon large chunks of a book as “well, the narrator probably is unreliable,“ without there being some other hints or clues about what actually happened. I’ve known other authors to pull off the unreliable-narrator thing pretty well, but (imho) when it’s done well there’s telltale clues and inconsistencies and other sources of information, such that an alert reader can put the puzzle pieces together. To have to hand-wave large parts of a book away with a vague “well, some of this is probably wrong”, yet without any specifics, just makes the whole thing feel so vague as to not be worth the effort.","lut26ne"

He’s a good prose writer, but a bad plotter, and the plot of his books feel like it stands still pretty much after the first 200 pages of book 1.

He created a cultural less absolute totalitarian nightmare state across trillions of human lives for three thousand years. He brainwashed death cult worshippers that were absolute fanatics. It was North Korea x 1000 and because of the Sight no one could oppose him. 


There was no art/entertainment/music/culture anything but worship of the God Emperor. Humanity has a natural desire to create and express itself and that dramatically forced evolution down only one survival instinct: to escape the sight. 


And God Emperor starts off with some humans stealing one of his journals looking for a weakness to exploit to kill him. And he didn't see it coming. Humanity at least some of them had evolved enough to escape his reign of absolute terror. And he's glad the Golden Path is finally coming into fruition.


After he's assassinated, his next part of the plan goes into motion as he transforms himself into a bunch of larval sandworms that can survive off arrakis, so Arrakis is no longer the only place for the spice. Part of his genetic will lives on suffering for all eternity as Worms spread all across the galaxy allowing what is known as the Great Scattering. 


Where without the God Emperor any more humans are finally free to splinter of everywhere and do whatever they want. Want to become a transhuman Cyborg? Go to this region of space! Artistic Hedonists go here! People who want to reestablish worship of Jesus Christ here! Everyone fucks off everywhere in the Great Scattering and Humanity is never rules under one empire ever again. ","luv52we"

Eric does not want this, but there's basically no getting out of it without incurring the wrath of the vampire society, Sookie would be in grave danger. Eric is despondent, because he can't think of a way to fight it and protect Sookie.  Sookie, despite knowing his maker's treatment of him, still somehow blames Eric for this, and is super pissy about it like he cheated on her, and eventually just leaves him to be sold off (even after Eric does some things to ensure she won't be taken by his new 'wife'). It's genuinely horrible.!<

I'd respectfully disagree there. The first book is obviously Roland and Jake's, the second about pulling the team together, and the third was them actually adventuring as a unit. They'd need that time to build a bond in a weird-ass world where the baddest dude ever is just being cryptic and telling them they have to go someplace for reasons. It'd have felt trite to me if Roland just stopped in the last act of the second book and did a big exposition dump, plus the fourth book sets the stage for the remainder of the series.","luvifqx"
