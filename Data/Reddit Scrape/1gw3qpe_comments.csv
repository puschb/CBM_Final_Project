"ly6prbl","Fantastic_Surround70","2024-11-21 02:14:02 UTC","In May 2012, I was suicidally depressed. My life was in tatters. And i was flying to a conference. They were offering vouchers to give up your seat and take the next flight. I had resolved to complete my presentation, sort of wrapping up my academic career, then after flying home and getting things in order, use the voucher to fly to a different city and end my life. 

I took the offer,  sat a few hours, and they put me in FIRST CLASS on the next flight. 

I settled in and took out Irvine Welsh's ""The Acid House."" Soon enough, an airline employee was seated next to me. I nodded and carried on. 

A minute or so later, I noticed the guy across the aisle talking to my seatmate. Then they switched seats. 

""Hey, I saw you're reading Irvine Welsh, and I had to talk to you..."" and for the entirety of the five hour flight, we talked about everything under the sun. Deep conversation, light humor, really, everything. Cliche: I felt I'd known him all my life. 

We hugged and parted at the airport after exchanging phone numbers. Neither of us ever called. 

But I felt hopeful, lighthearted, even. I thought, ""What the hell, maybe I can patch enough of these moments together to make it worthwhile.""

I flew home after the conference, my life still in tatters, but with that warm little memory and a bit of hope. 

Anyway, it's 2024, and I'm still here. There have been good times and awful ones since then, and my life is currently in tatters once more, but I'm going to go ahead and live. 

I still think of Bryson fairly often. I hope his life is good and that the world rewards him somehow for saving me that day.",""

A friend and I got in the habit of bringing books to read while we waited in line because we're both big readers and had enough longstanding friendship as to be comfortably silent with each other. There were basically three reactions to seeing a pair of teens reading books in line for what was at the time the world's tallest roller coaster. Most people never gave us a second look. The majority of folks who gave us a look, looked at us like we were crazy. And the remainder looked like they were extremely upset they hadn't thought to bring a book for an hour long queue.",""

I ( in sweats since I change always at my lab job) babbled some stupidity about how Martin was a great but uncommonly harsh writer, much like king sometimes, how I loved Pratchett and Tolkien. We walked the lenght of the city, my usual stroll to my job, and he said goodbye going to his job before running after me and asking me to lunch. I was OVER THE MOON. 

We met in the city square, he treated me to pasta, and we both gushed about fantasy till he commented there was a Tolkien fangroup, a Smial,  in the city and he was part of. I begged him to help me enter, he was happy to, we had to run to our jobs since we almost went over the lunch hour.

And he vanished. Remember: barely facebook, didnt share phones, I stupidly thought I would see him in the train. Nothing. So I searched for the Tolkien group, when to an initiation, finally was invited to a "" Tavern"", a party in costume. I dressed TO THE NINES like an Noldor lady expecting to see him again. And I saw him. With his girlfriend. AND HE DIDNT RECOGNIZED ME.

But for a day, I was stupidly happy...",""

I agreed and she gave me her book, which was Ben Elton's Chart Throb. Very cheesy read. 

About an hour into the flight I look over at her and she's somehow about over halfway through my book, which was a good 800 pages. She basically put her finger down the middle of the page and would scroll from top to bottom in about a second and then turn the page.  Another 45 minutes later and she hands me the book saying she's completed it.

Me being doubtful, I asked her to give me a summary of the book. She then proceeded to provide a detailed description of the plot up until the moment I read to.

Turns out I was sat next to the European Speedreading Champion (I've never verified that this was an actual thing and I never got her name). She has a learning difficulty which makes it impossible for her to read full sentences word for word but by her own description she just reads the middle word of each line and her brain just puts it all together. She said there were a few downsides to it. One was that reading was becoming too expensive for her and that she couldn't get lost in worlds because she would read them too quickly.

I often think of where she is nowadays especially with the wide availability of audio books and apps like Libby.",""

Because, as with all things, alcohol made reading even better (tbh retention went down, but aesthetic appreciation of language and attention went up what with all the mental cobwebs being cleared out in the flood).

Anyway, I had a boozy book club at a bar scheduled for noon on a Saturday. I wake up early and am like ‚Äúwhy not make a day of it?‚Äù so I head to Rays Happy Birthday Bar a few blocks from where I was living in south Philly. Rays has a clientele of nurses getting off night shifts so they open at like 730 am. So I‚Äôm there bright and early by 745.¬†

Sometime around 9 I‚Äôm probably on my 4th or 5th sitting alone at the tables outside where you can smoke enjoying the sunshine. I‚Äôm slowly wending my way through the New Oxford Annotated Bible (which I was reading out of historical/literary/sociological interest) and some guy, already clearly drunk, sits down next to me and is like ‚Äúah the Good Book‚Äù

I‚Äôm like ‚Äúfuck‚Äù. The guy grills me a little bit about whether I‚Äôm a Christian, refusing to take my polite ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just curious‚Äù as an answer until I explicitly tell him¬†I‚Äôm not a Christian. Then the guy starts going on about how he‚Äôd been in a dark place but Jesus had come into his life and saved him. And I‚Äôm sitting there thinking ‚Äúobviously I‚Äôm in no place to judge but we‚Äôre both chainsmoking and getting hammered before 10 am outside a shitty bar in south Philly. This is a very bleak image of salvation.‚Äù

The guy asks if he can pray for me and I say sure, thinking that the prospect of keeping me in his nightly prayers would get him to leave me alone. Instead he starts praying out loud in his¬†normal (loud) speaking tone starting with the Lord‚Äôs Prayer and then petitioning god to enter into my life. And all the while he‚Äôs maintaining eye contact with me the whole time.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about the way, when you walk
down a crowded aisle, people pull in their legs
to let you by. 

Or how strangers still say ‚Äúbless you‚Äù when someone sneezes, a leftover from the Bubonic plague. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt die,‚Äù we are saying.

And sometimes, when you spill lemons
from your grocery bag, someone else will help you
pick them up. Mostly, we don‚Äôt want to harm each other.

We want to be handed our cup of coffee hot,
and to say thank you to the person handing it. 
To smile at them and for them to smile back. 

For the waitress
to call us honey when she sets down the bowl of clam chowder,
and for the driver in the red pick-up truck to let us pass.

We have so little of each other, now. So far
from tribe and fire. Only these brief moments of exchange.

What if they are the true dwelling of the holy, these
fleeting temples we make together when we say, ‚ÄúHere,
have my seat,‚Äù ‚ÄúGo ahead‚Äîyou first,‚Äù ‚ÄúI like your hat.‚Äù‚Äù","ly73qqx"

Some of my favorites that aren't generally talked about in book-y places, even if by known people are:
Kiln People by David Brin
The Light of Other Days by Clarke and Baxter
Artifact by Greg Benford
Destination: Void by Frank Herbert

It‚Äôs not romanticized per se, but it definitely paints a picture that leaves out the true stress/strife associated with law school, especially in contemporary times. it also slightly eggs you on just because of how he writes it off as an ambitious but intellectually fulfilling journey. which it can be but i think the best proof is just taking a general pulse of law school now and it‚Äôs not like that at all really.¬†
i actually think some of the law subreddits have in their wikis not to make your decision to attend based on the book.¬†

i am also very impressionable and my career is a trash fire dumpster so i started getting sucked into a law mindset. that lady made me realize it would actually make my life worse.¬†

It‚Äôs kind of funny in the book, but you can tell he is scratching some horrors out as it‚Äôs alluded that he had some marital issues but he never really goes into depth talking about all the strains it had on his life.

Marx is one of the ‚Äòmodern‚Äô ideologies (alongside capitalism, science, communism, etc) which postmodernists teach to be skeptical of.
