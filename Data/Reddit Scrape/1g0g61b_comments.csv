"lr982w5","randommusings5044","2024-10-10 14:24:29 UTC","I started with The Vegetarian, good book imo though my favourite by her is Human Acts. 


Based on the three works I have read by her, I would say her strength and her style is sparse, almost clinical at times, and her eye for observation is very powerful. 


Be it chronicling modern Korean societal isolation or certain historical events, her storytelling has that element of transcending the specific place and striking a universal chord. The Vegetarian reminded me of Japanese author Sayaka Murata's work e.g. The Earthlings. Kang's work has elements of the surreal and it can also veer into the brutal quite unexpectedly. 


Another thing - she has range. All three works I have read by her have been very distinct in subject matter and authorial voice. ","lr8sjro"

"lrdvfqa","randommusings5044","2024-10-11 08:52:09 UTC","Without going into too much detail: 
 
The Vegetarian is about how society stifles an individual, how we cannot let people be, even those near to us from the perspective of a young Korean lady. It then goes into surreal and slightly horrifying territory to explore the deeper implications.  


 Human Acts is chronicling a tragedy that actually happened in contemporary Korean history through multiple perspectives. It is done in a very humane manner, this quiet strength emanates from the writing, feels very universal. Very beautiful and powerfully executed work. 
 
White Book is one I did not get but its a meditation on grief and different facets of the colour white as related to loss, while also processing a personal tragedy. If you have read and liked Yiyun Li's nonfiction work or Bluets by Maggie Nelson, this one might work for you.  


I haven't read Greek Lessons so I am unable to comment on that one. 



As many other posters have commented, We Do Not Part is coming out in early 2025. This is by a different translator duo (all 4 titles above available in English so far have been translated by Deborah Smith). I also saw a comment on r/literature in their thread commemorating the Nobel win that We Do Not Part is a worthy successor to Human Acts (which is my favourite by her so far). 
So this seems like an interesting title to pick up for multiple reasons. 😁","lrathyp"

Kafka on the Shore I had a goddamn hard time trying to figure out what exact branch of Queer the Librarian was when they explained it. And that book was translated to English in 2002, back in the Don't Ask Don't Don't tell days. 


Turns out it's a very specific Japanese cultural queer position that is not in every LGBT culture in the West. Kinda like the infamous Ladyboys of Thailand being a unique cultural thing. 


So there's a major character in that novel that represents a very specific trans queer position unique to Japanese culture that I have to read though an English translation made to sell to Americans during the Bush Administration, and gayest main stream awareness that the general audience is aware of if Will & Grace or maybe Queer eye for the Straight Guy. 


Kafka trying to understand this characters position in society when they themselves have a hard time dealing with it is a pretty poignant and remarkable theme, especially given the era and cultural conservatism of both Japan and the Anglosphere as whole during that time period. ","lr8sh1a"

I swear the only reason they tried to give Sartre the Nobel prize for literature (and the only cheeky bastard to turn it down) was because Camus died in a car crash. ","lregu1d"
"lrduqyd","randommusings5044","2024-10-11 08:43:58 UTC","Yes as u/DonnyTheWalrus said it means simple, very contained, not much ornate vocabulary or lush phrasing. Usually its a conscious authorial choice to convey a theme. McCarthy's The Road is a very interesting example of this. Ursula K Le Guin also has this way of writing in my opinion. ","lranb7y"

one critic described that book “like a cross between a Pynchon novel and a Confederacy of Dunces”, which sounds great ngl.","lrdwb6s"

The Japanese market is big enough to sustain the media industry, whereas the Korean market is tiny so Korean media execs have always pushed towards international expansion. It's so normal for Kpop groups release music in Japanese and Chinese and they have done so for decades - how many Jpop groups do the same?","lr9x5h1"
