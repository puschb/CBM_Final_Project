"lu1kw0i","UtopianLibrary","2024-10-27 17:59:31 UTC","Literacy rates are dropping at extremely concerning levels. She likely has a ton of juniors reading at a fifth grade level and an administration breathing down her neck to pass everyone. 

The sad thing is these kids do not have the reading skills or ability to understand Hamlet. It seems like her words are being taken out of context, especially considering the actual reading level of her students. What she is saying that even college English majors have some difficulty understanding parts of Hamlet (which can be true). 

I read Hamlet my junior year in an honors English class. My teacher did a lot of pre-reading with sonnets to make sure we understood how Shakespeare wrote and the vernacular. We also learned about how plays were put on in the Globe back then. We all had the historical context to understand this (students at this teacher’s school may not even have the historical context because social studies is being taken out of the curriculum).  We also read King Lear that year, which was a bit confusing during the storm parts. 

I then again read Hamlet my sophomore year of college in an English major Shakespeare class. I definitely understood it better, but it was really only because my teacher taught us the basics in high school. Same for King Lear. I definitely developed a deeper understanding for them that year. Shakespeare was one of the few English classes I got a B in during college. It was difficult as an English major whose professor was a legit Shakespeare scholar who wrote books and literary articles about these texts. The standard is much higher, so it is difficult to understand in college. It’s more than plot. My professor was obsessed with the idea of “green space” and nature being associated with the magical realm, and applied this to every one of Shakespeare’s texts except Macbeth (Somehow I’ve never read Macbeth, despite majoring in English).

Edit to add: Social studies is being phased out or the class time is being given to reading instruction in elementary schools, which causes a major deficit when students enter high school and middle school. Also, some middle schools have an English/history class double-block period called “Humanities,” which can easily turn into only an English class. It still exists in high school, but only two years of social studies is required to qualify for admission at most colleges. The book The Knowledge Gap by Natalie Wexler explains this well.",""

Already this year I have had to change my lesson plans to REMOVE primary source documents because my students CANNOT READ. 

It's not that they can't read complex texts with old fashioned language; they are functionally illiterate. 

I can only imagine a high school lit teacher struggling year after year with Hamlet and the reading levels getting worse and worse finally decide to give up and just remove the whole thing.",""
"lu1od4d","Violet2393","2024-10-27 18:16:22 UTC","I find it sad too, but I understand where she was coming from. My best teachers were the ones that found ways to meet students where they were and help them get that little farther ahead than just forge ahead and leave them in the dust. 

My very best teachers (like top 1%) were even able to have different students learning at different paces, even at a high school level. 

I had an English teacher that dropped part of our reading requirements in order to teach us grammar because it just had never been taught to most of us. And this was an honors class - we were all smart enough - we just had never been given that particular education. At the end of the year we had read less books, but our writing was so much stronger. 

I had a chemistry teacher that wouldn’t let you move on from a unit until you demonstrated to him that you understood it. He would also teach alternative methods if you were having trouble with the general method. I never did so well in a science class in all my life. I started slow but caught up by the end. I even took and got high honors on the state chemistry exam. I often wonder how things would have been different if all my science teachers were like that.",""
"lu1m71f","Adept-State2038","2024-10-27 18:05:53 UTC","I have taught Shakespeare - it is not as hard as people make it out to be. But it does take a skilled teacher to bridge the gap for students. Vocabulary, syntax, and the context of Shakespeare's era can all be barriers - but I consider them not barriers but another rich part of the learning experience. 

That being said, I too have been in school environments where literally none of my students could read at a level even approaching a novel, let alone shakespeare, so it would have been a gargantuan task for me to scaffold enough to get them to have a bare understanding. 

I also taught in a job with all newcomer immigrant and bilingual kids - all of whom needed english language support. Shakespeare was simply not the text for them to be learning English with.",""

I would LOVE to teach a text like Hamlet, but our levels of barely functional illiteracy are truly shocking.  Out of 120 students, I have less than 5 who could handle a text like that, with support.  Kids do not read today. At all.  It’s shameful and don’t come for teachers - this starts at home with kids who were never read to as children and kids who did not master basic phonics by third grade. It breaks my heart and it’s why I stay in the classroom as a literacy teacher.",""
"lu1owyz","oh_such_rhetoric","2024-10-27 18:19:03 UTC","High School English teacher with nearly a decade of experience here. Shakespeare is hard. Like, the language comprehension, let alone the content or themes or figurative language. It’s basically a foreign language to these kids who, at the rural, high-ESL population, Title-1 school I spent most of my career at, had an average of a 7th grade reading level in 10th grade (and didn’t improve much through 11th and 12th grades). I was required to read one Shakespeare play for every course I taught, every year, and it was always a disheartening struggle for me and most of my students: the kind of struggle that makes kids hate reading and hate English class.  I found myself using “translated” versions a lot,  which took most of the soul and poetry out of the texts. (And yes, there are great things like graphic novels and movies and recomposed stories like *The Lion King* or *10 Things I Hate About You*, etc.but that’s NOT reading the original text). But it’s better, honestly, to start with other, original, that contain amazing stories that are much more comprehensible and enjoyable if you want students to actually learn something and enjoy what they’re learning. 

Sure, keep it in AP and honors classes and high-income schools, and give it to advanced students where it’s an *achievable* challenge and builds skills and confidence. However, most kids need to be met at a lower level, respected for what they can do and can learn, and given something that they CAN rise to the challenge of. 

I don’t want to offend you, OP, but you’re pretty clearly one of those people who can rise to that greater challenge. I would not be surprised if you were/are in those advanced classes. But I’d like to call you in as a book lover (rather than call you out), and tell you that this take is very off and not considering important information and context. For you, learning to read these old texts in older versions of English is rewarding. With that in mind, an equivalent challenge for you to understand what most students would be experiencing would be reading something like *The Canterbury Tales* in the original Middle English, with a teacher who keeps telling you “just keep practicing and look up words if you need to” as if 7/10 words weren’t completely incomprehensible and the whole venture isn’t just ridiculous. 

I encourage you to think about those other people who don’t have the reading skills you have, or the life circumstances that allowed them to gain that high reading level, and that they deserve to be taught with books they can actually enjoy.",""
"lu2fmib","zdrums24","2024-10-27 20:30:55 UTC","I think people are taking this wrong. What are the learning goals for the unit? How do you get students to meet that achievement without introducing unnecessary hurdles?

Shakespeare's English was different from ours. You don't drown your kids in that kind of language unless there's a reason to. I have consistently scored above average in reading tests (including the GED), etc and I still have to have some sort of guide or reference to understand significant portions of Shakespeare's writing. 

Given the current lack of care or respect for education in US society, I don't fault the teacher for pulling it. People in the US don't value education. They either don't care about or only see school as a means to an end (scholarships in college). Until that is fixed, our schools are going to be struggling.",""

It connected with us teens. We finally understood the intrigue, drama, angst etc. Hearing it in modern terminology helped immensely. The following week we acted out the OG style and everyone had a blast because we 'got it'.

"lu1uz0u","MiniaturePhilosopher","2024-10-27 18:48:28 UTC","I graduated high school in 2005, and it seems like kids were already struggling with reading and comprehension skills then. Non-honors classes seemed to be laser-focused on making sure that everyone could easily pass the class rather than helping them reach age-appropriate subject mastery. I’m terrified to think of how bad it must be now.  

But even then, Shakespeare was a core part of each grade’s English/Literature curriculum. I believe all freshman did Romeo & Juliet, all sophomores did Anthony & Cleopatra, honors juniors did the sonnets (not sure what non-honors read), non-honors seniors did Macbeth and honors seniors did Hamlet. And by “did”, I mean read aloud and dissected line by line. Understanding how to read Shakespeare was non-negotiable in a Texas public school just twenty years ago.   

Between linking school budgets to standardized test performance, teaching for the test, slashing teacher salaries, increased class sizes, increased child poverty, addiction to mobile devices (me too✨), and shattered attention spans that need instant gratification - I don’t know how we have any hope of fixing public education. It feels like it might have even been broken on purpose to leave large segments of our population behind, both economically and in critical thinking skills.   

As much as my gut reaction is to be rankled by the headline and jump into an explanation that Hamlet is pretty digestible, all that really does is derail the real headline here. We’re looking at the first real generation of teachers who were failed across the board by public education becoming educators themselves. It’s no longer just an occasional teacher saying things like this. And even new teachers who received a stellar education are coming into classrooms where the average reading level is far below where it should be age-wise.",""
"lu1wk3r","Pretty-Biscotti-5256","2024-10-27 18:56:17 UTC","Is it the actual play they said was too difficult or was it a general statement about Shakespeare being too difficult? Former English teacher here and while we taught Shakespeare in 9th, Romeo & Juliet, and in 10th taught Julius Caesar, they were never easy units because in general education classes the reading levels vary but that wasn’t as much as issue is that the units are 100% teacher dependent. Kids were never going to read the plays on their own, and also plays aren’t necessarily meant to be read, rather be experienced as a performance. So even the best students, even if they did read it on their own, they could really even retell you what happened.  They might get the gist of it and that’s all we could hope for. We read the play together as a class as we listened to the audio and stopped after every scene to summarize and analyze. It was long and laborious and even the scripts has summaries and notes to help in comprehension, it still became more of me telling them the answers to the questions that were meant for them to guide in comprehension. We watched a performance of it, too. Many kids check out even at the mention of Shakespeare and we’d lose more along the way. My point is that while I love Shakespeare, it was difficult to teach it, for so many reasons. As far as Hamlet as a play, it’s one of my favorites, but I also think Shakespeare, especially that play, should be left for honors and advanced level students. Probably an unpopular opinion in the teaching world, but I stand by it.",""

I teach title 1. Always loved Shakespeare as a kid. Got to watch Hamlet at the Globe! I'm blessed, lucky, etc. this year that I have a very driven group. The former MS-13 love Cormac McCarthy. They're able to read Marquez. Junot Diaz. Etc. Hell, we just read Mr. President by Miguel Asturias. They can read. It takes a minute because the stamina is shit. But they can read a word on the page and understand what word means.

Now for context. 

My kids haaaaaaaated Romeo and Juliet. The characters, the plot, Romeo was a pedo, etc. They were like fuck that lol but they picked it up. Now we're reading Hamlet and it's hard 

Wanna know why? Allegory is lost on them. A lot of the books I just mentioned are crazy straight forward. Like sure they can pick up what's being told to them. I got a fortunately smart class and I can just be blunt ""it's suicide y'all"" but they're not catching the allegory or meaning. We actually just did a whole La Llorona -> La Malinche thing and they really didn't pick up the colonialism part. 

It's kinda like actually a lot of my students have read it before in Colombia. The thing is that in a lot of places it's just taught here is the thing. The thing is that. Or have never seen it live, so so much of it is lost. It's not to be or not to be is about suicide, it's just his choosing. 

But there really is never any time they're taught allegory before they get to me so now I'm like having to go grab all the Marquez and Fitzgerald I can find because they need 500 ccs of metaphor and allusion stat",""

(even though he has written many good stories)  
Reading a text like 'Hamlet' is work, and not easy for a modern reader.  
  
Then, what is the point?  
  
One major benefit of reading hard texts in school, is that you learn how to proceed if a text is not immediately meaningful - of course that means that the teacher has to demonstrate how to use different types of dictionaries and encyclopedias to understand the words and the context... and **THEN**  explain why this is a good story (in case of 'Hamlet'), or contains knowledge the pupils might need (in case of laws, manuals, and other hard texts)  
  
If 'Hamlet' is a modern students first exposure to studying a text to find the meaning, then expecting them to read the whole play will turn them off - both from Shakespeare and from studying in general.  
A good teacher will begin with more accessible texts, then move on to excepts of hard texts, and only then attempt a full reading of a text like 'Hamlet'.",""

>What makes it worse is that the teacher said that she was personally confused when she read it ""at a college level""- bruh. Idk.


I have to share the story of where I was at a conference center outside a conference of State University Administrators getting some refreshments from the conference refreshments.  (I wasn’t there for their conference but stopped by the table to get some coffee from their offerings.)

Some of the administrators were talking by the refreshments having just walked out of a meeting.   It was a continuation of the conversation they had had within the meetings.  

They continued their conversation while I sat there.  

I gathered from context that they were probably academic deans at schools of education for different state schools around a very large state.  

They were talking about how poorly the education majors perform and how it is getting worse each year.   One said that most of the students shouldn’t be there (and no one seemed to disagree).

They said they have to give all the students Bs because without Bs they can’t take the state teaching certification exam.  So if they gave them Cs they would graduate with a degree in education but not be able to teach in the state public schools which would make their degree basically useless. 

Basically they were venting.   It sounded like they had been raked over the coals for possibly poor performance and they were saying their hands were tied.  

One of them said something to the effect of: “What do they want us to do?  Fail the kids so they flunk out or transfer out and then we don’t have enough kids to take the classes and we are out of a job?”

It was pretty sobering to hear.  This was something like 15 or maybe 20 years ago.",""

9th - Romeo and Juliet
10th - Julius Caesar
11th - MacBeth
12th - Hamlet

All tragedies, no comedies.

Yet ironically, “The Odyssey” was assigned to 9th grade English which is far more complicated than most Shakespearean plays. 

I am far removed from High School, but even when I was in school, fewer than half the students could get through the play without Cliff’s Notes or a film adaptation. So while this is disappointing to read, it’s kind of understandable.

There have been pushes to remove Shakespeare from English curriculum reading lists in favor of more modern and more diverse alternatives.  We live in much more technologically advanced world now then when I was in school, and I strongly believe that plays should be seen more than they should be read.

"lu9orpy","Pa_Pa_Papas","2024-10-29 00:16:59 UTC","I was forced to teach Shakespeare over a decade ago, and only about 4 of my ~50 seniors could read it on their own. I mean gleaning the basic meaning of each sentence, not the layers of depth. That meant it had to be read in class. The early modern English, unusual grammar structure, ect made it hard for even my decent students. I also had about 5 students in that group that couldn't make it through below-grade material, so reading at a speed that everyone could pay attention to was literally impossible.

Those seniors would be in their late 20's now. It's only become harder for the average student to  read Shakespeare, and their teachers were students like these. Not to mention excellent students will not generally become teachers anymore because in states like mine (Texas), it's a hugely sacrificial career choice. This is our reality, and it's not the teacher's fault.",""

"lumdfoo","AloneCalendar2143","2024-10-31 00:51:37 UTC","Very few people can take in and fully absorb Shakespeare by reading his texts. Nearly his entire output was plays, such as Hamlet. Hamlet was written for…the stage. That’s why they’re called ‘plays.’ I used to think people should read Shakespeare before seeing the plays, just because I could and liked to. And I enjoy the sonnets, the poems. But it’s just not true. 

So, while I think the teacher spoken of by the OP needs to work on her problem, I know (from an English teacher friend who explained this to me) the way to introduce and teach Shakespeare is through film and theatre first, the way the playwright intended. Some kids will always be bored with him. But once a spark is lit in some students who feel the excitement, they can carry on learning the Bard in English Lit, listening to readings, watching on tv, seeing the Folios, trips to performances, and yes, reading aloud in the classroom of a very imaginative teacher. 

The kids who have troubles passing their basic HS English classes shouldn’t be forced into learning this semi-foreign language. If they’re interested, great. If they get the rhythm, great. If they don’t, leave them be. It’s just not worth it if the teacher can’t make it so the kids can relate to it. Let them watch it, instead. If it’s going to happen for them, that’s where it will. 

To the OP, your example of Jules Verne really doesn’t equate well enough as his writings are (Edit: forgot he wrote in French which was translated to English - which did you work through, OP?), just from another century.

"lungqr8","MuseoumEobseo","2024-10-31 05:05:54 UTC","Hot take but even as a lifelong strong reader, I think a lot of the books/plays taught in junior high and high school in the U.S. are probably not understandable to the vast majority of students reading them. Not necessarily because of the language (although yes for Shakespeare), but because they don’t have the necessary life experience to relate to it in any meaningful way. See: me and The Scarlet Letter, Hamlet, Animal Farm, and The Great Gatsby. I only have anecdotal evidence for that, but I really believe it’s true. 

The stuff I had profound experiences in school with were not necessarily easier reads, but they were either more relatable or more familiar topics: Life of Pi, The Kite Runner, To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Of Mice and Men, Flowers for Algernon, Fahrenheit 451, The Giver, Lord of the Flies, Macbeth.

On the other hand, it sounds like Hamlet is beyond the teacher's ability to teach well. Ultimately, success has to be measured by student outcomes rather than by counting notches in a literary belt, and the outcomes will be better if the students are studying texts that the teacher is capable of engaging with on a meaningful and nuanced level rather than something that they themselves struggle with. Reading Hamlet thoughtfully and reading Hamlet.for the sake of saying that one has passed one's eyes over the words on each page and gained a general familiarity with the plot because it's some short of tick box for participation in western adult society are two different things! And as for ""joint learning for teacher and students"", mutually challenging environments and collaborative discussion are great in upper level university courses, but in a highschool context the leader has to occupy a position of greater authority (both topical and institutional).

With historical context it's fascinating and hilarious, but that doesn't belong in a general high school English class. The purpose of high school English is to promote and encourage literacy, and the way to do that is introducing things that are relevant, novel, and revolutionary today.  Shakespeare is not.",""

The way I see it, there's Shakespearean translated books where it's written in modern day English, if that's the problem. I found that I was looking back at the translations (even got a copy from the library with the translations) so that I could read it with English for reference. I did read the original text as well, and tried to compare/contrast the translation to the original to essentially ""teach myself"" the vernacular. 

I found that the plots were easy to follow once I read the translated versions, and easy to follow. For me it was a problem of not being used to the language conventions because they're wildly different.

I still believe Shakespeare books are fun reads when you find something that suits your fancy (I didn't like the tragedies I am more of a comedy person) or if you find aspects you like. 

  
Speaking of other older texts, I pretty much sat myself down once and read the original Sherlock Holmes stories with no simplification or anything (admittedly i looked up 1-2 words every so often because they were older phrases) but otherwise I understood every word and kept up marvellously. I read 1000 pages of that (multiple stories in one book).",""

There's value in the stories, and for the curious the writing.... but they're an utter waste of educational time when you could go through a lot more modern material that potentially can cover the same material without needing to deep dive into antiquated forms of English.


I've never enjoyed any bit of writing that used antiquated or local English, even when it's a dialect I actually speak and read with only sparing exceptions. I'll only percevere out of curiosity and if the story is good you'll find it elsewhere so it's rarely worth the effort.

It’s pushing them through and telling them they understand grade level material that they don’t, and it will fuck them beyond comprehension when they’re adults and aren’t equipped to handle even an entry-level menial job.

They take the mindset of if everyone can’t be super, then no one can be.  Everyone either has to gave the exact same opportunities, or no one’s given any.

I can guess how that happened to Gujarati - more people got education but less qualified school teachers were around. Best of my language masters were nearing retirement and would have started teaching in 1960s. 

In general Gujarati lost her prestige in Independent India without royal patronage of various princely states. Hindi and English devoured the funding as well as the talent in drama, film, television and even in class enrollment. This in turn fed into the distancing of the Gujarati kids from Gujarati literature. What one should have known at 17, one now only suffered to learn at college if one was not good enough to get into a better program.

The daughter said, ""Oh, she just died recently."" I think it took me a full 30 seconds to get my voice back. ""No, Elizabeth the first."" and then had to spend forty-five minutes giving an abbreviated history of the Tudors and Elizabeth's reign.

I can't quite understand why we use one guy's stageplays from almost 500 years ago as a benchmark for ""being educated"" in reading and English. I find Shakespeare's plays to be pretty fucking boring and obnoxious to read. They were the worst part of English class. All of them.","lu1kw0i"

I was in a moderately shitty public school district growing up, and we started reading Shakespeare, albeit in abridged fashion, in grade school; we read and put on as a class at the end of the year an abridged but in the original language ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" in fifth grade and ""Julius Caesar"" in sixth.  (I still have the two big Puck soliloquies plus Antony's ""Brutus is an honorable man"" speech memorized ~25 years later from hearing them so many times in rehearsals).  We started reading at least one (some grades two) actual full length Shakespeare plays per year in seventh grade, and in high school they were often paired with later related works, like getting to see ""Ran"" after reading ""Lear"" or reading ""Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" after ""Hamlet.""   Did a lot of stuff go over our heads?  Absolutely, as I learned in middle school on my second read of ""Midsummer,"" in high school on my second read of ""Macbeth,"" and in college encountering ""Lear"" and ""Hamlet"" again (and ""Midsummer"" again again).  But we still learned a lot.  

On the other hand,  if half your class legit can't handle ""Hamlet,"" I think senior year of high school is way too late for a single teacher to be fixing this, so I sympathize with the teacher here as well.

Give them Julius Caesar as their first Shakespearean play. It’s long, boring, difficult, and full of background political machinations that high schoolers are only beginning to grasp. I hated Shakespeare my high school life because we got that followed by Macbeth in 10th grade. 

My Senior Honors English teacher knew exactly how to teach Shakespeare. He taught Hamlet and pointed out the insults, jokes, and irony (the teacher had a wicked sense of humor), and taught us how to read the stage action like it would be performed so Hamlet had both low culture and high culture appeal.

We also had the appeal of Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet at the time which should be an essential teaching tool for teaching Shakespeare in English class. Baz triple underlined every single sentiment in that play to make sure every line was understood. 

Without Baz Luhrmann and my senior English teacher, I would have hated Shakespeare all my life. Now, I just hate the play Julius Caesar.

I literally slammed my head against my desk, pillow, hands because it was so boring.   However after going over it in class I was able to see why we were reading it.   It made it easier to read Shakespeare with the class.  And although I still cannot get through Moby Dick or Chaucer I can see the point of other books and can tell good writing from bad.   

I’m many years out from school but I can really appreciate having read difficult books.  The teachers who gave me the knowledge and ability to read these books allowed me to do well on the English Achievement test and score well on the Verbal portions of the SAT.   I’m a science person so I get the chance to read really long and boring papers.   And when I do, I always say there’s nothing in this paper that is worse than Rölvaag.  

Kids will miss out on Shakespeare.  They will never understand nuanced speech and comparisons, which come up time and time again.   Latin is another loss. No one takes it and it makes it difficult to communicate when using abbreviations.   In my own field we have to “simplify” things in “normal” language because everything has to be readable by the public, even though we do high level scientific work and abbreviations are used to simplify the writing and understood by most in the field.  

This is an era of transformation and we all have to adapt but I’m really worried about the younger generation. They are missing out on a lot.    No cursive writing was the first miss. My kids cannot write in cursive and I’m shocked.    I did “force” them to read one book during the summer breaks and now that they are grown, they look back and really appreciate that we did it.  

For me I think that there needs to be a middle ground for all of this simplification and the first thing that I would do is leave Hamlet and Shakespeare in the curriculum.","lu1kw0i"

That doesn't mean we can't or shouldn't read them too, of course there's plenty of benefit (educational and simply entertainment) to doing that.

But I firmly maintain that a good education system should include taking kids to see a live performance, or having the performance come to the kids, before diving into the text. It gives you loads more context to help unpick the text. Ideally, there should also be linkage between English lessons studying the text, and drama lessons working on the same text, physically. And where possible, present film versions including modernisations, too. 

I also do think neither Hamlet or Macbeth should be any kid's first Shakespeare experience. They're both superb (I was tech crew for a touring production of Macbeth as an undergraduate, I love it dearly) but the subject matter is just harder to relate to IMO.  MSND and the Tempest work as plays even for pre-teens because we all come across fantasy/fairy stories growing up. R&J because teens can connect with crushes and romance, whether they admit it or not (and the Baz Lurhmann movie is just superb). 2GV, 12N for the slapstick and cross dressing.","lu1m71f"

"lu24fyd","thosedarnkids","2024-10-27 19:35:46 UTC","Thank you for posting this.  Please don't ascribe the deficit entirely to reading level.  I was a prolific reader in high school. I was reading science fiction books translated from German and Russian with foreign structure and colloquialisms.  They were difficult but I was able to figure them out.  But when I first read Shakespeare it was complete gibberish to me.  

>> Vocabulary, syntax, and the context of Shakespeare's era can all be barriers - but I consider them not barriers but another rich part of the learning experience. 

This is exactly it.  It is important to realize that these barriers are largely insurmountable for high school students who don't already have a knack for figurative or anachronistic language or previous experience with Shakespeare. I don't think my English teacher had the time or inclination to provide us with that context.  What is ""training wheels"" reading for Shakespeare anyway?  I lacked the experience to provide context to the figurative language.  I received my first and only C and vowed to never read him again.  
Once revisited in college, it all clicked and I loved his work.  I wondered how I ever had difficulty with it which is what I fear too many teachers believe.  That it is all fairly straightforward symbolism that any high school student reading on level should be able to comprehend. It wasn't for me.","lu1m71f"
"lu5d3pa","dunno260","2024-10-28 09:13:13 UTC","Shakespeare was just torturous for me to read.  I could never get past the language myself.  It wasn't any different for me than reading some really dense philosophy works where I have to reread the same thing over and over again to the point that it actually becomes less clear.

And watching it either as a play or a movie doesn't help me.

I went to a private college prep high school and some things I couldn't parse through even if it fascinated me.  Dante's Inferno wasn't that much different for me either.  I loved everything about it other than reading it.

It was such a stark contrast for me when we would go to other books.  I absolutely devoured Faulkner's As I Lay Dying.  Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are dead was amazing.  And I can't express how deeply Vonnegut's ability to describe something so simply stuck with me.

But then we would also read excerpts from other important works.  I could muddle my way through them somewhat if it was kind of old and not overly dense.  A modest proposal by Swift wasn't an issue for me nor was one of Martin Luther King's letters from a Birmingham Jail.  But then something like Freud or Jung would be almost as difficult for me to parse but at least that was limited to a 10 page assignment or so.

There is grammar in Shakespeare that reminds me of bloody German lol (because grammar that many German dialects and middle English shared went extinct a couple of centuries after Shakespeare in English.

"lu3r9gs","wisebloodfoolheart","2024-10-28 00:53:04 UTC","I was an AP student at a fancy private school who graduated in the top ten. I still think students should read one Shakespeare play, max. We had to read four and I think that was a ridiculous amount.

It's not that it's impossible to understand. It's that the extra effort it takes to understand is not worthwhile. The payoff for learning the vocabulary and syntax of a Shakespearean play is ... you can read a Shakespearean play. The plays are not any deeper intellectually than any other work of literature, especially the comedies. They have elements like foreshadowing, allusions, and metaphor, but nothing unique that other literature doesn't have. There were poetic structures, which is cool, but I don't see why it matters. And yes, Shakespeare invented a lot of words, but there's no special value to reading them in their original plays.

Not only are they difficult, but they're too old to really hit emotionally. There are lots of allusions in the plays to mythology and history, and you can stuff in loads of explanatory footnotes like ""Jove was a god who did X, and Mab was a fairy who meant Y"". But a modern reader will not really feel the power of the allusion in the intuitive way that it is meant to be felt. Whereas if a kid reads a phrase like ""As you wish"", or ""Who do you think you are, Iron Man?"", they would understand that immediately in context and get what the character was trying to say, and why allusions are powerful. And you can also try to explain things like ""it was normal for army captains of this time to do X, it was strange for women to do Y"", but you're still just explaining something the audience is meant to understand already. And yes, I know the plays have crude jokes in them. But snickering over a dirty joke in fancy language doesn't seem like an intellectually important experience.

But isn't it valuable to read something you don't understand and get to flex your analytical muscles? I'll tell you what would be far more useful than reading an English play from 1600: reading a modern work from a lesser known foreign culture. Something from South Africa with political nuance, or full of Australian slang. Something that might help them understand the perspective of living, relevant people rather than long dead privileged people.","lu1owyz"

My class was supplied with a version of the play that had a modern translation alongside the original writing. I found this made reading the play a lot more accessible.

Shakespeare is important to learn for higher ability students because the language ability in the works and cultural references are so high quality and rich. But for many school children it is too high level. For example back in the past students had groundings in;:

\\* Classics: Greek and Latin

\\* English: Grammar Rules, Poetry recitals, hymns etc

\\* Religion, Art, History and Classical Music references as context

NONE of that is true of 99% students today! Standards have completely changed or declined in expectation and proficiency levels.

"lu391c2","LittleWhiteBoots","2024-10-27 23:08:12 UTC","John Hattie, well-respected educational researcher, explains:

“No single intervention by schools is worse than retention. The major reason why retention is so harmful is that the child is subjected to the SAME curricula, often the SAME assignments, often the SAME form of teaching and what this child needs is DIFFERENT teaching – the first time did not work. It also set a clear expectation of failure.“ 

I agree with Hattie’s take, that instead of retaining kids, we accelerate their learning with research-based interventions, hiring and retaining qualified teachers, and resigning school structures to promote more intensive learning. Unfortunately, many schools can’t afford to do what’s best. I’m in that boat.

She went to school in the Dominican Republic before she came to the United States, and she only spoke a few words of English. Because of the grade system in the Dominican republic, she was also a year younger than the rest of the children in her grade in the US. I suggested that it might be a good idea if she was to repeat a year of school while she was catching up in English, but they wouldn't hear of it. 

Anyway she did okay, and she is graduating from high school next year. But she has completely forgotten Spanish and cannot speak a word of it, even though she took Spanish classes in high school, which apparently you are only allowed to do for 2 years. 

The people in the US school system are very isolated from reality and have very peculiar ideas about raising children. For example they reward children for good behavior and academic performance by giving them candies, apparently never having heard of the detrimental effect of sugars on the teeth of children. When I sent a letter pointing this out, they decided that they would continue to give the children candies, but not my daughter! I told you they are nuts!","lu1pe93"

I don't know if the place is just built on a cosmic nexus of stupidity or something, but a lot of the customers are completely illiterate. 

The few people who actually do see the big-attention-grabbing menu board say ""I want that"" but just points... they can't tell me what it is they want to order or even try to sound it out because they can't read. They can't use synonyms to describe what it was they want because they never learned words can mean more than one thing. 

Multiple people point to items on the station(s) and don't know how to describe them because they never learned what adjectives are. Others don't seem to understand that smaller numbers mean something is cheaper so they are shocked that a smaller item is in fact cheaper. 

And when it comes to coupons.... ugh. I get that a lot of coupons are written in very deceptive ways with loads of fine print that's designed to be hard to read, but the level of comprehension is just unacceptable to say the least. Someone gave me a ""Buy one get one"" and when I asked what their other item was, said ""But the coupon is 'get one free'."" When I told them they needed to buy two items to get ONE of them for a cheaper price, they just gave it to the next person in line instead... who also thought it was ""Get one"". 

Multiple times a day, someone comes up and says they want to use this coupon and order an item that's explicitly NOT covered under the coupon. I ask if that's alright and... they still think it's covered. Others try to give me coupons that expired months ago and are shocked that I can't take them.

Modern scientific analysis of how the brain works and where the eyes focus when reading has showed this pretty objectively not true and the academic community now considers it completely debunked.

I interspersed the reading with assignments teaching the figurative devices shakespeare uses - alliteration, hyperbole, etc - and also the word reversal and similes frequently used. Learning these literary and linguistic devices is just as much a benefit of reading shakespeare as understanding the plot and literary themes.

i also encouraged students to use no-fear shakespeare, a website that provides a plain-english translation alongside the traditional text. deciphering the text is not the point of reading Shakespeare.

I also made my own note-taking structures that i made my students use which had them taking notes on new words and their definitions, plot points of the scene, important linguistic devices, and important themes in the scene.

at the beginning of each class, we also watched a youtube video recap of the previous scene.

If a student gave any effort and attention at all, they did fabulously well in my class and had no problem understanding the text.

we also alternated on different days between reading as a whole class and reading in small groups - only rarely reading alone. and almost always performing out loud as a class.

Shakespeare himself coined many, many words and phrases that we use today. Our language wouldn't be what it is without his contributions. words so mundane as ""uncomfortable"" came directly from his creation. So, i doubt that many of his terms will fall out of usage that aren't already uncommonly used.

Holy shit, I've been thinking this exact same thing for a while now. Glad I'm not alone lol

Whether people like it or not, literature is primarily a matter of hedonism (someone as bookish and conservative as Jorge Luis Borges admitted as much), just like movies and any other form of artistic expression. How many people do you see decrying that kids aren't watching Sergei Eisenstein or learning to use oil paintings? That's what I thought. Forcing these things into the scheme of curricula and grades is bound to be counterproductive, as countless stories from our decade and past ones can show. If you must keep schools and ""English"" in school, teaching *reading* and interpretation as such, and broadening the scope to include things like news, chronicles, academic articles, speeches, essays, columns, think pieces and the like will give students a more complete foundation than hyperfocusing on fiction as most curricula do.","lu1zob1"
"lu21gcd","Adept-State2038","2024-10-27 19:20:51 UTC","that sure is a hot take! that's the one true thing you said in your entire comment. 

A lot of college professors are seeing students enter their classes who haven't read a single book in their lives - so apparently a lot of high schools agree with you. But this is a disastrous policy and I think it's affecting an entire generation of kids negatively. 

If you think non-fiction informational text analysis is the only skill people need to be employable, you will be surprised to find out there are a vast array of cognitive skills that are demanded by our ever-changing job market. 

I don't have time to convince you of the again, vast array of important cognitive skills that are provided by reading literature and fictional texts. There are lots of sources online that you can find if you care. 

But I will say that the text itself doesn't matter so much as how the teacher teaches it and what linguistic and cognitive skills are being learned through the use of the text as a material to to work on. Shakespeare's oeuvre in and of itself is not necessarily edifying - the texts are incredibly rich, complex, and rewarding for students and teachers to hone their mental and linguistic skills on. 

Furthermore, just being able to read a longer text, having a longer attention span, strengthening the mental muscles required to focus and concentrate on something that takes a bit more time, and to synthesize information gathered from larger texts (not that shakespeare's plays are long at all; they're not) is a fundamental reading skill for every single person. Reading is not a binary skill - the notion that a person can read or can not. Reading competency is a long, long spectrum and a person needs to read frequently, for prolonged periods, and with attentiveness and purpose, to strengthen their reading skills. Every single professional career out there will require a person to read with attention and purpose at some point. If a person has only ever read brief informational articles up to that point, they will be woefully unprepared and possibly unwilling to even try.","lu1zob1"

Even *The Taming of the Shrew* will get them angry enough to engage. 

But Hamlet? For teenagers? Eh. I’m an English teacher, with an MA in English Lit, and I have always loved the more subtle stories and character conflict it over action.

In most circumstances teachers are given a choice of a set of options that they are comfortable with. The teachers decide which book out of the set of options that they want to teach. 

Generally, teachers will choose based on their personal interest or comfort level. 

Patrick Suskind's *Perfume* is an option for me, but I've never touched it and used it as a school text because the subject matter is too dark for my tastes. Shakespeare's *Titus Andronicus* is as well, but I don't pick it for the same reasons. 

There are some texts that I will admit to being out of my grasp as well. Would I teach *Ulysses* by James Joyce even if it were an option for me (it is)? Probably not.

At least if they're retained they have a chance of getting caught up and being successful as they move forward. Social promotion is idiotic.","lu1xlp8"

That is a huge problem. High schoolers are now entering college expecting to be able to turn in work on the last day for full points.  Assigning no homework is a HUGE issue.  How the actual fuck are these kids supposed to handle college with absolutely no experience independently working on their own?  Those teachers were against even sending work home that they didn’t do in class when they were messing around.  They’re teaching kids they can fuck off, never do anything, and still pass.

Ten minute a night in lower grades, even if it’s a short page of some math drills (which doesn’t need to be a large part of their grade) or an assigned chapter out of a novel, helps then get in the habit of doing a little work on their own so that, when they get older, they’re better prepared to start taking charge.

I’d love to hear all of you who are anti-homework go tell college instructors that there shouldn’t be homework, only what’s done in class.  That is literally all these kids are prepared to do.  Last year, one of my instructors repeatedly begged the class to turn their work in so she doesn’t have to fail anyone.  She allowed a lot of late work for full points, but at the start of this year, made it clear (same students as certain classes series in certain programs tend to be taught by one person) that she would only accept late work for half points, and even then, she’s still begging people every class to please get work done.

This is how you fail kids, and the solution isn’t to throw your hands up, declare it wasn’t their fault, and pass them anyway, since employers aren’t going to take the same mindset when there are adults who are capable in need of jobs.

It’s WIDELY acknowledged, even among teachers, that what’s being done is failing kids and turning out graduate who are entering college literally unable to read.  These same teachers complain about how every new year is a new class of kids who are years behind grade level, yet there’s no attempt to change anything, only a defense of the very methods they openly admit aren’t working. It’s pure fucking idiocy to defend what you know is now working.

By the way, a masters doesn’t always mean shit.  About 15ish yers ago, phonics were abandoned in favor of whole-word and using pictures for context clues for what a word might be, and this has resulted in millions of kids who are functionally illiterate, who can’t sound out new words, who can’t understand anything without picture.  IT IS UNDENIABLE that this has failed, and now a lot of those teachers are saying phonics needs to be brought back.  Masters or not, they were fucking wrong, and they admit it.  And they’re wrong now, admit it, and still defend what they admit has been turning out illiterate graduates for college instructors to deal with.","lu2oj48"

Whereas my class did Tempest at age 11 and that was fine (expectations were age-appropriate of course). I think we did R&J for GCSE English (prolonged study over ages 15-16), were able to really get deep into it at that age but as you say, can still get a lot out of it while younger.

My 9th grade English class had one Shakespeare book and some other well known books.  But we also read excerpts from the bible, the koran, and the bhagavad gita.  We read Swift's essay ""A modest proposal"".

In my 10th and 1tth grade English class we were reading not only Hamlet and Dante's Inferno but Martin Luther King's letters form a Birmingham Jail, excerpts from psychologists like Freud, Jung, and Howard Gardner.  I believe there was a supreme court case in there.

My AP European History course had its texts supplemented by books on the Spanish Armada and The French Revolution.  When we got to the enlightenment we read a book by Voltaire.

Another history class I took required us to read Time every week with a brief quiz along with it.

My chemistry class required us to write a paragraph summary of some news article every week about something being done in the world of science that we found interesting and we would spend half a class every Monday talking about that and it was rarely stuff about chemistry.

My milenial, gen x, and boomer former bosses and family friends are lucky to finish a romance novel a year in my experience when I ask. Every generation thinks the next is dumber, but the fact is college rates keep growing and our economy keeps getting more information based as a result.

> But this is a disastrous policy and I think it's affecting an entire generation of kids negatively.

What policy? Everyone I know in my generation was forced to read Shakespeare. By your logic that should of made us as good as past generations at reading. Maybe there's a chance a single mediocre play isn't a life changing experience. 

 > non-fiction informational text analysis is the only skill people need to be employable, you will be surprised to find out there are a vast array of cognitive skills that are demanded by our ever-changing job market.

This is the same vague argument every department uses. Learning anything provides 'cognitive skills'. The argument is which does it better– should a mandatory video game class be implemented because it provides motor skills as well as cognitive skills when you play games like Portal 2? Knowing how to format an academic paper or understand a data set will serve students better *and* provide them a vast array of cognitive skills in a changing job market– its two birds one stone. Or, if your goal is to primarily to get students engaged, then choose a book they'll like such as World War Z, Three Body Problem, or Project Hail Mary so students actually want to come to class to engage on the subject matter. Shakespeare neither gets students engaged nor challenges them in a way that is useful for the real world. 

> vast array of important cognitive skills that are provided by reading literature and fictional texts

Fiction is fun, but let's not pretend like it matches the real world educational value of nonfiction. There's plenty of narrative driven stories like One Minute to Midnight, Charlie Wilson's War, Wild Swans, or A Season of Inquiry that can teach students how to construct a narrative, extract themes, and show character development while at the same time teaching students about the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Soviet Afghanistan War, China's modern history, and how Congress works (Areas that plenty of 'literate' people fail to understand due to a lack of time in school dedicated to them). 

>  Shakespeare's oeuvre in and of itself is not necessarily edifying - the texts are incredibly rich, complex, and rewarding for students and teachers to hone their mental and linguistic skills on.

This is extremely subjective and not exclusive to Shakespeare.

> just being able to read a longer text, having a longer attention span, strengthening the mental muscles required to focus and concentrate on something that takes a bit more time, and to synthesize information gathered from larger texts (not that shakespeare's plays are long at all; they're not) is a fundamental reading skill for every single person.

Romeo and Juliet is 23,000 words, making it fall into the novella category for length. Most assigned books are longer than it– it just takes students longer because it's practically written in a different dialect of english given the passage of time. 

> Every single professional career out there will require a person to read with attention and purpose at some point.

And most require non-fiction reading skills, not theater script reading skills. 

> If a person has only ever read brief informational articles up to that point, they will be woefully unprepared and possibly unwilling to even try.

Sometimes it’s homages, sometimes it’s creative variations on them, or other types of treatments. They didn’t really think of rewriting and re-using things as a bad thing back then.

Hell, Shakespeare even rewrote his own stories sometimes, in a sense. Like, did you ever notice that *Othello* and *Much Ado* have very similar plots except for a couple of circumstances that make one a comedy and one tragedy? If you look at Claudio’s lines when he thinks Hero is cheating on him, they are eerily similar in threat and violence level to Othello in the handkerchief scene. Not to mention the sheer amount of times the man used a set of twins, a person cross dressing (or cross dressing twins!) over and over again because they were dramatic and comedy GOLD.

But yes, to the rest of your point, I 100% agree. Shakespeare uses a ton tropes and archetypes that exist in other stories that are much easier for students. And students LOVE learning about tropes and archetypes, btw, especially if you ask them to think of media they like to relate into what you’re talking about.

Now my Calc I course was at 8am as a freshman - this was not a wise decision - and I basically never went to class except for the exams and scraped by with a C-. But I was content to do that - I wasn't a math major, I was a biology and psychology focused major - I was exceptionally skilled at statistics and economics, I simply did not have a predilection for more advanced mathematics. I satisfied the minimum requirement for math for my field, and moved on.

Indeed moving on from university into my professional career, I found that social skills, soft skills, are infinitely more valuable than hard skills, as they lend oneself to autonomy and even leadership, and are far less common in general - but if you have both, the sky is the limit.

That being said, I never have had to apply mathematical knowledge greater than statistics or in learning how to get Excel to do the math I want for me - because I work in a space of the sciences which does not command mastery of higher mathematics!

Why the bloody hell would someone choose to MAJOR IN MATH! If they didn't have a genuine talent and passionate interest for such a dry subject.

Part of the issue is people still trying to find a magically one size fits all solution to learning. So a lot of weird shit gets embraced and spread because it happened to work for some kids, even if it is horrible for the majority.

NY is currently having a lot of discussions on boosting education standards, especially when it comes to literacy. With new laws potentially in the works so will see what happens. One big point being whether to make it state wide or let districts keep more control. NYC and embracing Calkin being a big point on both sides. District control let her shit run rampant there.

What else have you also noticed that's changed to result in kids being as...rambunctious...as they are now? I graduated high school in 2015. Just shy of a decade ago now. Sure, we had the disrespectful one and the kids getting high in the bathroom and students getting into fights and all that. That's as timeless as school itself. But from what I see now that gets posted on Reddit, high schoolers have devolved into a whole other lower species. Like, the amount of brazen disrespect and hostility among them seems a lot higher now than it was when I was in school.

Is it just that parents don't parent well anymore or is it something else? Cause when I was in school, teachers would physically remove a trouble maker from the class and basically tell them to get lost. Wouldn't let them back in. Now if you breathe in their direction the wrong way, it's a lawsuit. Assuming we start at 2011 when I entered freshman year, it's only been 13 years. That's not that long for such a drastic change to happen. Is it social media? We had Facebook and Snapchat and IG all that but I feel like it wasn't as intrusive as it is now. I'm wondering if the shared rebellion on such prevalent media forms has something to do with it.

Joking aside, I promise that I do sympathize with your position. I think that high school students should receive some homework, as that's when the studies point towards it doing good for learning outcomes. 

I also agree that students do need to learn to work on their own, and more importantly to find a passion for continued learning outside the classroom. I'm just not sure that assigning homework in elementary school is the most effective way to go about it. I'd be happy to be proven wrong by new educational research. 

I can say anecdotally that as an elementary school student I transferred from a school which gave no homework to one which gave a lot of homework. My grades were identical across the two schools, but I was much less happy at the second one. I can't say that homework doesn't improve other children's ability to do work on their own, but it didn't have much effect in my case as I was already learning to work on my own at the school which didn't assign homework. 

I'm not against students doing work of some kind outside the classroom full stop. I think projects (especially ones with a little creative freedom built in) can be impactful for kids of all ages. But that's almost never what people mean by homework. They are usually talking about the sort of worksheets which time and time again have been shown to be essentially useless for student learning.","lu3z3fe"

They spoke of bedtime stories and stories their elementary school teachers read to them.

Developing a romantic fixation on books and storytelling is very important. I now collect books as a result of my mom reading to me and I have an egregiously large library.

As for my son, I started collecting children’s books before he was even born and would read to him so often that he memorized dozens of books and can still do all the voices with me years later, too. He’s a teenager now and isn’t as much of a reader as I’d like, but his head and heart are in the right place: He’s fascinated by intellectual topics such philosophy, psychology, and history.

I got burnt out and took a prestigious private school job this year. The main difference between these kids are that they don’t have unlimited screen time or personal devices. Their parents also respect teachers and expect their kids to follow class procedures and school rules. This applies to the scholarship kids as well, so it’s not 100% an income gap thing, although that is definitely a major factor as well.

Basically, what was being taught to kids emphasized to them to use things like the context clues of a sentence, pictures if any are present, or using the first and last letters in a word to try to guess it. The problem is that this isn’t how the brain learns to read in the English language. The strategies kids have been taught using this method are essentially the skills poor readers use to try to cope with struggling to read a text. Kids can basically be taught to memorize a piece of text, but they don’t actually understand how to decode what they’re reading. Decades of brain research have shown that most children have to be explicitly taught how to match the spoken sounds of a language with alphabetical writing. States that have started to ban this method of instruction in favor of phonics have started to see improvements in literacy scores.

Parents today are incredibly stressed and resort to the lowest common denominator “safe” option to occupy their kids. Which means screens and bright colors.  This is a multifaceted problem but I think several huge factors are at play: 

 -our cities are built around cars and parents don’t think that their children exploring the natural environment is safe any longer, justifiably 

-there is less community trust, so parents would rather their kids be at home on a screen rather than at the park with their uncle 

-childcare is incredibly expensive and screens are incredibly cheap 

-both parents working is a virtual necessity for most families

 -PTO sucks 

-schools are expected to pick up the slack, but our schools are incredibly unequal in terms of resources. Rich area school districts can pull 4x-5x the funding as a poor area school, in the same city. 

-well resourced schools do much better on average 

-schools/teachers are pressured to pass students because the alternative (to hold kids back or send them to remedial school) is often the worse option. Remedial school is basically setting kids up to be low achievers, it puts them in with kids with extreme behavioral issues. Better to see if they can catch up with gen pop.

"lu2ezir","Random_eyes","2024-10-27 20:27:46 UTC","That's kind of a challenging question, because there's a lot to unpack. There's been the gradual shift away from books as a form of entertainment for a century (going from radio, to TV, to computers, to social media), arguably a cultural devaluation of education, the heavy-handed use of metrics and KPIs to determine educational outcomes as opposed to functional skill assessments, a shift of resources away from teachers and towards administration, a segregation of students based on economic status, a loss of funding as resources are shifted to private/charter/religious schools, large-scale teacher turnover due to stress and relatively low pay, COVID-related disruptions to education, questionable teaching pedagogy in education, and of course, the smart phone distracting students in ways that previous generations never had to contend with.


Some of these things are basically impossible to undo (it's not like we're going to take a sledgehammer to our computers any time soon), but I'd say a teacher-centric model of administration in schools, higher pay to entice quality educators, an end to education privitization, and maybe some sort of public funding into improving educational pedagogy would be a good start. Alas, the most likely fix will probably be getting smart phones out of schools, which isn't a bad idea, but probably not sufficient by itself. ","lu1nvai"

There’s also other issues at play. Education funding relative to GDP in the US went through a steady decline in the 2000’s and 2010s, even as costs increased. It went up by a modest amount in 2020, but a lot of that went to costs associated with the pandemic. (A quick look for more recent stats didn’t turn up a whole lot.)

Funding increases being directed towards non-education costs has also been a trend since at least the 90s when education was (arguably) a higher priority. Even then, around 60% of increased funding went to “non-general education” related expenses. That is, things other than instruction, materials, etc. directly related to a child’s learning. Pair these secondary budget allocations with issues like the recent period of harsh inflation, and the actual amount that is dedicated to each individual child’s education might be lower now than it was 10 or 20 years ago. 

Another issue is teacher retention. It’s really bad right now. On average, more than 20% teachers leave each year, and among new teachers, and teachers in poorer districts, it’s a staggering 30%.

I that time, in a worldwide population of 1.8 billion, over 50 million people had died, mostly young, healthy people who should have been most resistant. That’s actually the driving reason why WWI ended—troops were decimated by the flu.  American schools didn’t wait until the risk was zero.  They got kids back in classrooms within two months.  The death toll was falling.  

In the US, people wanted Covid to be entirely eradicated.  I know people who still won’t let their kids go out.  There are a couple kids in my neighborhood who have been seen once since March 2020 since they’re still inside for their “safety.” Covid reached a worldwide death toll of 7 million on a worldwide population of 8 billion, with most deaths being among the already infirm and extreme elderly.  Yet the world was closed for over two YEARS.

In stark numbers, the flu killed 1 out of every 36 people worldwide.  Covid as present in 1 out of every 1,142 deaths (there’s debate on if Covid should really be listed as the cause in people who were already at the very ends of their lives dealing with several co-morbid conditions, but let’s count the for the sake of argument).   To reach the death toll of that flu, America alone would need to see 9.5mil deaths, more than the worldwide toll of Covid.

Yet even in 1918, they knew it would be more harmful in the long run to isolate kids indefinitely.  These days, we see it as a safe idea to isolate kids because, for all the talk about mental health, no one cares about mental health or quality of life, only about number of years, hence why we keep people who are suffering on ever support to keep them alive even when they’re 95 and miserable.  We see it as a win to get the life expectancy up regardless of misery.","lu244xr"

Its the references, vocabulary, puns, and idioms that make shakespeare hard.  A lot of the idioms and references arent used today. Shakespeare also makes a lot of references to Greek and Roman mythology, some of it pretty obscure by today's standards. Shakespeare also was the first to write down a lot of phrases. The good ones stuck around and became idioms in modern English. But the not so great ones didn't enter the lexicon, so your typical high schoolers isn't going to understand them.

Yeah, there are going to be some passages that read comparatively easy. But then you're going to have some passages where your typical high school student is going to need research the meaning behind every other sentence, which is a rough thing to do to them.

It's giving parents who force their kids into playing sports that they hate, even though we can of course connect certain positive lessons and experiences from sports. 

Yes I would rather kids be interested. It fosters lifelong literacy and the exact same cultural lessons can be taught from other classic works. Hemingway! Nathaniel Hawthorne! J.D. Salinger!

"lu4w1zc","Odd_knock","2024-10-28 05:57:33 UTC","I should be more specific. 

 Let's consider the second word of Romeo and Juliet - ""Two households, …"" 

 ""Households"" means something much different now. Shakespeare's households are aristocrats. That context is important to understand the completion of the idea a few clauses later. 

 Two households, both alike in dignity  (In fair Verona, where we lay our scene), From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,  Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.   

I'm not saying high schoolers can't understand that household has two meanings. I'm saying that the concept of aristocracy is foreign to American high schoolers. I mean “foreign” literally. America has never had a formal aristocracy with inherited titles.  

Without that understanding, several key ideas become clouded: When Shakespeare writes about an ""ancient grudge"" - how ancient is ancient? decades? But in aristocratic families, grudges were inherited like titles. They passed down through generations, becoming part of the family identity.  

Even ""civil hands"" and ""civil blood"" - without understanding aristocracy, we miss that these nobles were supposed to be the pillars of civil society. 

 This loss of meaning isn't happening in isolation. Each of these words - ""households,"" ""ancient,"" ""civil"" - loses its historical context at the same time. And Shakespeare has used a parenthetical structure here with two clauses between “households” and the grudge... When you can't fully grasp the weight of each term, the relationships between them start to blur. The syntax itself - how these ideas connect and modify each other - is hard to follow. You’re not just searching for the meaning of words, but simultaneously the underlying grammar.  

And this barrier isn't uniform. I agree that bright students everywhere are able to learn to read Shakespeare. That said, a student in New England might have cultural touchstones - family stories, local history, even architecture - that make these aristocratic concepts more accessible. But for a student in Los Angeles (for example), whose family heritage might be rooted in entirely different cultural traditions, these European feudal power structures could feel completely alien. We're not just crossing time when we read Shakespeare - we're crossing cultures, and some students have to cross a much wider gap than others.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ So be careful of your context when you say it is easy.   

You might say, “well, read a different play,” or “not all of his sonnets have this combination of complications,” but I want to go back and note that we are considering the second word and the first sentence of the play. This missing context complicates nearly every paragraph in the play. 

 At some point we will need to acknowledge that English has moved on - that Shakespeare needs to be moved to “History of English Literature” in college, where it can be taught with the appropriate history, rather than in every American classroom.","lu4brj8"

This is when we need to retain students. Why 3rd grade? Well, it's the last year that reading instruction focuses heavily (or at all) on fluency. After that, it's mostly comprehension. 

In math, it's the main year for arithmetic fluency, so mental addition/subtraction within 20 (preferably 100), and learning and becoming fluent with times/division tables. After that, it gets progressively more abstract and conceptual. Not that concepts aren't taught in K-3, but the focus does tend to be more procedural. Procedural fluency is critical for higher levels of math. It helps with conceptual understanding, because the working memory isn't tied up with basic arithmetic since it's become automatic (in theory). The more we have to use working memory for stuff that should be automated, the less space we have to make conceptual connections. 

So, 3rd grade is super important. No child should be promoted to 4th if they're 2+ grade levels behind at the end of 3rd grade. If they're 1 grade behind, there should be a plan in place to help them get caught up in the summer and be ready for 4th. Yeah, summer school. Because if they're 1 level behind at the beginning of summer, they'll be 1.5 or more by the start of the school year with no intervention. And yes, this is all supported with research. 

Social promotion fails students in the long run. So do most things that parents and school administrators do in the name of ""protecting feelings."" Like, sure, we don't want to actively harm kids, but we do need to think more long term. If the thing you're doing to ""make them feel better"" now is going to harm them down the line, it shouldn't be done. Figure out a way to help work through the tough feelings, which is also useful for the future as it builds emotional resilience. There's little to none of that in too many kids. Protecting feelings now just to cause harm in the future is super dumb.","lu2732n"

Can you point to any large-scale reforms that have ""destroyed generations of kids"" and are also ""the same ideas"" as the past? Plenty of us came out of the public education system with decent educations just a couple decades ago and there are plenty of bright kids who are doing the same today in the same public education system.

The real question should be ""Why do American children experience such disparate outcomes in our public educational system?"" and the answer to that question is the same as the answer to the whys of most of our societal ills: poverty.

And I'm not just talking about school funding, although school funding via property taxes obviously leads to massive inequities between schools in rich vs. poor areas. I'm talking about things like:

- Nutrition: poor children are more likely to be hungry and hungry kids do worse in school

- Healthcare: poor children have less access to quality healthcare and sick kids do worse in school

- Environmental toxins: poor children are more likely to live in old homes with lead paint and to live near highways, which means their environment is tainted by lead from leaded gas. Lead exposure lowers IQ, which means kids do worse in school

- Home life: poor children are more likely to have an incarcerated parent, a parent working multiple low-wage jobs, and a parent with a low level of education, all of which leads to less parental involvement in education, which leads to kids doing worse in school

Etc. This list could be 100 pages long and still not encompass the myriad ways poverty negatively impacts education.

If student success is determined by the level of parental involvement, then the willingness of the parents to set and enforce a limit represents a greater level of involvement.  While the students at your private school have screen time limits, they also have significantly more involved parents, and this becomes a significant confounding factor in determining whether or not the limits are actually doing anything.

There are certain aspects of screens where we can quantify their impacts (such as on vision and sleep), but it feels to me that a lot of people are blaming devices for what really amounts to poor parenting practices.  Most parents wouldn't let their kid hang out with the bad crowd at the park, yet devices allow them the opportunity to do that if left unsupervised.  Similarly, no responsible parent would allow their kid to hang out at a casino, but that's what a lot of ""games"" amount to.  Once taking into account eyesight/sleep issues, the big issues you run into are how the device is used, and what it takes the place of, not how much it's used; after all, no amount of hanging out with Nazis at the park would be appropriate, but I think most parents would be fine with their kid heading to the park every day to play soccer as long as homework and chores got done.","lu1p060"

Reading is not taught properly in education, at least in the public domain from my perception. I never went to pre-school, but I attended Catholic school. One of the few good things out of that was a strong phonics base that really cemented reading fundamentals. Where you could encounter words (including unfamiliar ones) and work through them.

When I switched from private Catholic school to public school, even I noticed the lack of reading ability within my peers. They had no concept of phonics or reading fundamentals.

I'm not sure if phonics the best or only way to teach reading. What I can say is that reading is not taught in education currently. They just keep assuming these kids somehow pick it up and they never do. The building blocks of reading are not all that difficult to build either. So much attention is put on testing that the kids don't have the time to learn the basics.

The kids who don’t have fall into those categories get shafted because attention is first required to go to everything other than actually educating.","lu1rnr5"
"lu1t95a","AonghusMacKilkenny","2024-10-27 18:40:06 UTC","My mother was raised in the 60s and 70s. Back then, if you got in trouble at school there was the assumption the teacher was in the right, you (student) were in the wrong and you deserved whatever discipline you got.

Sometime between then and when I was growing up (90s and 2000s) the attitude had changed to parents thinking they always knew what's best and teachers disciplining students was seen as a personal vendetta.

""Just tell them to fuck off, son, that's what I did 🤣"" has been reinforced for at least two generations now; as you say, the erosion of respect given to teaching as a profession. It doesn't help how chronically underfunded state education is now.","lu1rnr5"

Keep in mind how kids rarely even have chores anymore.  There’s also a trend of seeing schools as being solely on the hook for all things a kid and their family needs.  Schools are expected to act as medical facilities for the students who are so disabled that independently doing even the most basic of functions, like eating, will never be possible, under the guise of “education.” This is technically respite care.  Schools are expected to handle the violent kids who they aren’t allowed to give consequences to, and to control the runners who know no one can even grab their hand to stop the from running into the street. 

Frankly, people need to stop having kids they don’t have the time of inclination to raise.  Kids aren’t object you can set aside and come back to later.  They’re human being who are being fucked up and raised to fuck up another generation.  The cycle needs to stop.","lu1qidn"

"lu2do4r","Author_Noelle_A","2024-10-27 20:21:29 UTC","After the post I was reading last night, also blame the teachers who say that the reason no kids should ever get homework, even the work they don’t finish at school, the reason no kids should get projects or book reports or anything of that nature at all, ever, is because some kids (like me) were dealt shitty hands and don’t have parents willing to help, or have to have after-school jobs.  Since some kids were fucked, the solution, rather than to try to help those kids, is to hobble all of them.  

When pressed, some tried claiming there’s no evidence homework helps at all, though that’s based on a study of lower elementary, when the daily attention span of kids is a lot lower.

So the solution is no homework and lowering the bar for an A to what the most disadvantaged* students can do, even if that’s six grades behind, and made that the new baseline to pass.

Yup, the growth is bullshit.  I am in college right now, as well as a parent of a highschooler.  When doing critiques in my writing classes, I was reading work that wouldn’t have passed third grade when I was a kid.  One student’s book summary was the copy/pasted blurb from the back of the book as “text evidence” of what the book was about.  He didn’t understand how to use his own words or to think for himself, only how to copy.  In all but three cases, students whose work I had to read couldn’t use basic punctuation.  That’s not high school graduate level.  They were literally writing at the level of elementary school kids. 

People insisting “science” and “research” show the modern methods are better need to ask themselves why adults in their 30’s and 40’s, raised under the method that were supposedly worse, can function and comprehend, while the kids and young adults raised under the new “better” methods are literally entirely incapable.  Yes, some of it is parents devaluing education, but some of it is teachers taking the mindset of “all succeed or none, and we need to lower the baseline for an A so it’s fair an equitable an all can get an A.” Emphasizing the A over actual learning, an only letting kids learn as much as the most disadvantaged, is fucking them.

Most damning was the argument that the more advantaged* kids have parents who can pay for tutors (I don’t know any parents who are willing to help with homework who have the funds to hire tutors, myself included) to teach what isn’t taught at school, and kids can always just self-assign themselves to learn more. What almost none of them realized is they are advocating for not even giving disadvantaged* kids a chance in the first place because some kids aren’t going to have the time or help at home.  For those disadvantaged* students, teachers assigning work might be the only chance they have to learn more.  They’re also advocating for kids teaching themselves what they don’t know they don’t know.

All because they think it’s more equitable to disadvantaged* students.


*I also don’t like how advantaged and disadvanraged were all about money.  My family wasn’t dirt poor, but my parents didn’t help.  I was parentified to the extreme hilt, dealt with their severe alcoholism, and even had to steal school supplies to do my homework.  But since we weren’t in poverty, I wasn’t at an educational disadvantage.  I had to literally fight my parents to be allowed to stay in high school, but had no disadvantage. My parents eventually forced me to drop out of high school, but due to not being in poverty…no disadvantage since it’s all about money.  I had poor friends in section 8 housing whose parents helped them.  One of their parents helped me sometimes.  My parents were too busy with my brother’s baseball games and telling me I was smart enough to figure it out on my own.  I got hit if I didn’t get A’s, but I got no help, and I learned in first grade that it was on me, and if I didn’t want to get hit with a belt, I better figure it out and get everything done on time.  Nothing was handed to me.  No homework, no work to be done at home, would have been the worst possible thing.  Yet according to those idiots, since I didn’t have parents willing to help, the bar should have been lowered, though since we weren’t in poverty, that means I wasn’t disadvantaged.  No wonder kids are failing.","lu1x7fs"

"lu25gjg","MiniaturePhilosopher","2024-10-27 19:40:50 UTC","Not an educator, but a former multi-generation poor kid. I was in honors classes all throughout my school years for every subject I took (minus physics, trig, and electives). Being intrinsically intelligent and “book smart” was actually highly valued in my family, and good grades were expected and required. The bookshelf was full of literary classics.   

**But** nothing was ever done to support that. I rarely had three meals a day, and sometimes not even two. On Mondays, I would be ravenous and had trouble focusing on anything until lunch. I was always had a background hum of pain from shoes that were too tight or too loose. And a level of being ostracized for clothes that were from charity and clearly out-dated.   

My family also had the stereotypical poor-family struggles with drugs, alcohol, mental illness, constant uprooting, and abuse. I was expected to get good grades, and high school came with about an hour of daily homework from each core class, regular projects for multiple classes, and independent study for academic extracurriculars. Instead of coming home and working on homework, I had to contend with drug, alcohol, and mental-illness fueled rampages. Trying to close my bedroom to focus got my door taken off the hinges and thrown in the dumpster. So I’d have to wait until about 2 in the morning to start homework, and work until it was time to leave for the bus. Obviously, that’s not sustainable on a daily basis. Despite my best efforts, I’d fall asleep at night instead staying up with homework and got a reputation among my teachers for not doing take-home assignments. I often spent class doing my homework for the next class.     

I was also one of the very few kids in my high school AP program who wasn’t enrolled in SAT, ACT, and AP test prep. I didn’t even realize that the prep classes existed, and couldn’t understand why my high scores got such a chilly reception from classmates. We didn’t have any kind of computer at home, and cell phones weren’t smart yet. I wasn’t allowed to participate in Duke’s TIP program even though I qualified and was invited to. My family actively didn’t want me to go to college. They wanted me to stay put, get to work, and give them money. I was absolutely not allowed to work on college applications or essays at home, and I also wasn’t allowed to linger at school once my extracurricular meetings wrapped up. None of my competitions were ever attended. I couldn’t afford to participate in school sports or band. I wasn’t allowed any hobbies that cost money. Being intelligent and getting good grades were treated by my family like a bragging point with their friends, not like a way to lift us out of poverty. It was a way to feel superior to the other poor families.   

I loved my classes and my teachers. If I had been graded - or at least helped - on a scale that acknowledged that I was hungry, in pain, couldn’t do schoolwork at home, and didn’t have a model or the resources for furthering my academic career, who knows. Maybe I could have gone further in life.  

And honestly, I was lucky compared to other kids in our trailer park. My family at least made going to school and getting A’s a requirement of continuing to draw breath. The kids around me were regularly truant, had atrocious grades, and either dropped out or were expelled. Out of the seven of us girls in the neighborhood who were right around the same age, two of us graduated. Five were pregnant before senior year (or what would have been their senior year). Three of those were expelled for truancy, two dropped out. And the other girl who graduated gave birth a couple of months after graduation.

If you hold up someone and keep them in 3rd grade 1 year, that's fine. If you hold up half the class, that's a problem, but maybe you can manage to get extra resources for a 3rd grade that's 1.5x the normal size.

But what about next year when most of those people still fail? And you're still holding up half the normal students, so the class just gets even bigger? At a certain point 3rd grade just becomes the final resting spot for students who don't care about their own education, and don't have families that will make them care. Which is going to hurt the actual 3rd graders, and be a negative influence on everyone else.

You'd have to rework the entire education system to support this, which is probably a good idea, but it would be expensive and require support at every level, including the federal level (because states need the federal education funding).

Until high school included, access to eduction is free. It means it's free to go to school. More than that, you're obliged to go to school until 18.

It stops there. All the books or tools you need to work at school is for you to pay.

Now, schools cannot oblige people to buy a 'textbook' so they can rent book to students for a few € per year.

But otherwise, it's still far from free but it's a lot cheaper than a lot of other countries.

How the universities get their money? Not the federal state anymore in Belgium but the regions (north or south, long story short). They have an amount of money they give to universities following the amount of students they got.

Roughly, it's about 23,000€ if I remember correctly per student if you had to pay it yourself.

As for the universities, let's say you've finished high school, you pay 835€ and you're in (you've just have to pass an exam for medicine or engineer to be in but no restriction on the number of students). If you don't meet certain criteria, you're out, you can't access universities or higher education for 5 years.

Even if you want to pay and have the money to pay fully 25,000€ to get in, you're not allowed to do so. I don't know why but it's the law. You can introduce a formal demand to the heads of the university to explain why you've failed etc. (I did it because I had health problem and I got in again).

When it comes to textbook, living, renting a place for most students, food, etc. You're on your own. Universities provides financial help to students can prove the income of the family are under a certain amount of money so they pay less and can access easier to a place to live near the campus. The procedure is quite 'easy' (meaning you're guided through the process).

"lu7u5zs","Neuroentropic_Force","2024-10-28 18:28:39 UTC","Bingo - most majors don't have any mathematics requirement at all. And this is okay.

Why should a History major have to study mathematics in college?

Why should an English major have to study mathematics in college?

Why should an Art major have to study mathematics in college?

As far as I can remember there were two categories of math requirements - heavy math requirements (higher order mathematics majors) - such as Mathematics, Physics, Engineering (all forms), Architecture (arguably a form of engineering), and the MD track.

Then there were the softer of the hard sciences, with a minimum requirement of Calc I or testing out of Calc with an AP Exam, these included - Biology, Psychology, Chemistry (though you'd better be ready to it), and miscellaneous fields who sometimes had greater or lesser or just slightly different mathematics requirements such as - Criminal Justice, Communications, Nursing, Physical Therapy (both which required Anatomy as well where other life sciences majors did not), Business (and all related majors), and others.

Bungling Calc I in the latter set is understandable, but you still need to at least get a passing grade - and as you yourself just noted, universities make this pretty hard to screw up entirely. 

What I can't understand is why students in the former category, that quite logically have exceedingly higher requirements for mathematical ability, would choose these majors without an interest and aptitude for math.

Even Finance majors arguably should have higher requirements than Biology for applied mathematics, but still they would not be dramatically more demanding, Statistics, Economics, Calc II at most? 

Universities are already in many ways a con-job by which the wealthy maintain control and power in our society (don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing higher education writ large, it does and has had a critical role in lifting people out of poverty, but its missuses by the wealthy are well documented and is not a mutually exclusive reality) - Can't there at least be some pretense to a commitment to some basic level of integrity?","lu4bb84"

I think retaining early elementary kids for a year may have some positive impacts and limited social consequences (wealthy parents proactively do something similar through redshirting), but beyond this limited scope it probably causes more problems then solves:

The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP, n.d.) notes the following among the negative effects:

-Most children do not “catch up” when held back.
-Although some retained students do better at first, these children often fall behind again in later grades.
-Students who are held back tend to get into trouble, dislike school, and feel badly about themselves more often than children who go on to the next grade.
  
The solution here is unfortunately significantly more complicated than holding kids back who aren't at grade level.  If I had a magic wand, I'd probably begin to tackle it with ensuring all children had high quality pre-k, high quality phonics instruction (the lack of I believe we'll find has been a major cause of so many students unable to read) both of which have a significantly better evidence base than retention.

University is free - you have to pay some taxes based on your income and some people don't have to but it's similar to the fee you posted. There's an admission test because universities can only accommodate so many students but since access to higher education is a right, if you don't get in you can sue the university and they let you in. That's why we had 300 students per class sometimes.

Textbooks and equipment must be paid for but can be bought 2nd hand.

What's changed is students are rarely failed these days. In my day some people were stuck for years cause they couldn't pass an exam that allowed them to graduate. Nowadays they essentially all pass and graduate in standard time. The level has taken a hit but the uni can boast more graduates.","lu59pon"

But there are plenty of mature students in PhD programmes.  Yes, they pay badly.  (Less so outside the US.) But it's an option.  

Also, I've read all of the not-vary-many words you've posted in this thread: you claim that you can't find an alternative and provide no further context other than your qualifications.  

I know plenty of people with math degrees working in other fields.  Heck, I interview people with math backgrounds regularly, but again you haven't expressed an expertise *within* the field of mathematics so specifics aren't available to me.  I don't think your ""leadership and administration"" master's is something that has marketable skills, so I'm ignoring it in this advice: that may be false.  Your teaching degree similarly isn't a plus if you're *looking to get away from teaching*.  

On the other hand, there's demand for maths teachers elsewhere in the english-speaking world, or at ""international schools"" worldwide that teach in english.  Getting into state-funded school systems will be trickier than IB or AP schools for licensing reasons.

Teachers need to be supported by parents and staff and given the respect necessary for students to view them as an educator and someone with a valuable role in their life. At the same time teachers need to be taken to task when they utilize excessive disciplinary measures for those not willing to engage in the educational process.

Not all students are willing to learn or engage but at a bare minimum you need the kids to have a general understanding and acceptance that they *should* respect them so that those who might otherwise engage can see the value of doing so, or at least tow the line.

I meant to give a *much* shorter reply, but it sprawled out because of exactly what you said here - folks who didn’t experience growing up in poverty simply don’t have a frame of reference for how that affects children’s academic careers. And my experience was as an only child, and doesn’t reflect the experiences of other impoverished families where older siblings have to care for the younger ones, or homes with infirm or disabled family members.  

I think a lot of people assume that government safety nets are doing their job to protect children in poverty and that parents are doing everything they can to support their children. The truth is that children in poverty are an especially vulnerable population, and that there is no one checking to make sure that their parents are making good decisions for their care - or even have good decisions available to them. Systemic poverty is an indisputable reality, but it can create adults who feel hopeless and make a lifetime of irresponsible decisions as a result. Plenty of families in poverty shun assistance programs and food stamps out of pride, laziness, or not knowing how to apply. And it’s always their kids that suffer the brunt of it.","lu3htoj"

This was a problem with your teachers. Good classes teach the language and metaphors and the general *writing*, the plot is just the very basic thing you start with to get an idea of what's going on. His mastery of English is still better than 99.9999% of writing that's come since, that's why he's still studied. You have this very twisted version of ""progress"" that people often have that anything better is newer, but that's not true just as everything older being better is not true, either. 

Writing isn't like basketball where the standards have gotten higher and higher and a ""just good"" writer now would beat a top writer of 400 years ago. Art doesn't work like that. You'll probably never read more than a couple of living writers with anywhere near Shakespeare's ability.

Modernity may not largely make older art obsolete, but Shakespeare’s heavy reliance on flowery wordplay in an ever-evolving language isn’t a great combination for readability.
