> Two-time Pulitzer prize winner Bob Woodward tells the revelatory, behind-the-scenes story of three wars – Ukraine, the Middle East and the struggle for the American presidency.
> War is an intimate and sweeping account of one of the most tumultuous periods in presidential politics and American history.
> We see President Joe Biden and his top advisers in tense conversations with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. We also see Donald Trump, conducting a shadow presidency and seeking to regain political power.
> With unrivalled, inside-the-room reporting, Woodward shows President Biden’s approach to managing the war in Ukraine, the most significant land war in Europe since World War II, and his tortured path to contain the bloody Middle East conflict between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas.
> Woodward reveals the extraordinary complexity and consequence of wartime back-channel diplomacy and decision-making to deter the use of nuclear weapons and a rapid slide into World War III.
> The raw cage-fight of politics accelerates as Americans prepare to vote in 2024, starting between President Biden and Trump, and ending with the unexpected elevation of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president.
> War provides an unvarnished examination of the vice president as she tries to embrace the Biden legacy and policies while beginning to chart a path of her own as a presidential candidate.
> Woodward’s reporting once again sets the standard for journalism at its most authoritative and illuminating",""

""Practically inhaled this one. Started late Tuesday night and by Sunday evening I was finished. Engrossing, even if not the most elegant writing style. I guess I have to take the author's word for the veracity of the included information, and I'm assuming most of the quotes aren't exact and are the result of people wanting to look as well meaning and competent as possible.

But as a whole, it's a great, valuable recent history book (up to August 2024), mostly, but not only focusing on the US foreign policy and the Biden administration's efforts to stay out of wars and to prevent WW3. (And throughout also being occasionally contrasted with Trump's dangerous idiocy.)

People, Americans and non-Americans alike, love to shit on US foreign policy, convinced they'd do a better job. The country sure has made some awful choices throughout its history, but my general vibe of ""wouldn't wanna be them"" has definitely not been changed by reading this book. Statecraft is hard. Who'd have thunk?

(Also, how have US oficials managed to stop themselves from lunging at Netanyahu is beyond me.)

Definitely a book worth reading. Those who most should read it, the idiots calling Biden a war criminal, likely won't, but they really, really should.""

(I'm European, btw, interested in US politics but not overly obsessed. I hope.)",""

But the Biden admin’s relationship with Israel is very different than I thought. Bibi is a liar and a war criminal and they can’t do anything about it. Don't know if it’s better or worse. Also gave me a whole new perspective on how incredibly Putin has failed in Ukraine. All the Russian soldiers from the initial invasion had their parade uniforms packed. They really thought they’d just walk right in there. ",""
"lt0tu03","prudence2001","2024-10-21 15:54:34 UTC","I really liked this book, primarily because it feels like Woodward is getting deep, inside-the-room accurate reporting of White House events, basically as they are happening. I believe his sourcing is very thorough as he seems to talk to everyone involved, and the sources, all on deep background (anonymous), appear to accurately report what really happened.

One of my favorite small nuggets of intelligence in the book is when Woodward writes about Trump's seven communications with Putin post-presidency (previously unreported, a bombshell in itself). Woodward got a direct quote from Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, that reads like the loudest non-confirmation confirmation possible that the US intelligence community knew full well that Trump actually made those calls, probably from listening in on the Putin side of the call. From the [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/trump-putin-woodward-book.html) about the issue -

*Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence appointed by Mr. Biden, hedged on the question when asked by Mr. Woodward. “I would not purport to be aware of all contacts with Putin,” she told him. “I wouldn’t purport to speak to what President Trump may or may not have done.”*

To me it's incredible to read about the capabilities that the United States spy agencies must have in regards to intelligence collection and their sources on enemies like Russia and Iran. It seems the US knows what Putin and Netanyahu will do even before other major Russian participants (Lavrov for example) know. Woodward even reports that there is an intelligence source deep within the Kremlin.

I also was sad to read what President Biden said about AG Merrick Garland, as it seems the President regrets selecting Garland, which most thinking people would agree was a huge mistake. From the same NYT article, quoting the Woodward book -

*“Should never have picked Garland,” Mr. Biden told an associate.*

I couldn't put War down, and powered through it in about 24 hours. After finishing the book, I felt the United States and the world should be damn thankful that there has been a competent President (and an excellent team around him, especially Sec of Defense Lloyd Austin, who flies under the radar) in charge of United States foreign policy these past 3.5 years. Had Trump been President none of these intensely complex and dangerous conflicts (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran) would have been negotiated with any skill. I'm not saying Biden has been flawless in his handling of these issues, but had the wrong guy won the 2020 election the world be in a much deeper and darker place.",""

1. Biden being able to coalesce Euopean countries and the United States to effectively block Russia from taking over Ukraine is the biggest foreign policy win of his administration. For the six months prior to the start of the ""special military operation"", it was like a Cuban Missile Crisis situation where the Biden administration was simultaneously trying to figure out whether Putin really intended to start an invasion that made no sense from a pragmatic perspective while trying to convince European leaders that Putin was planning the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II.
2. Benjamin Netanyahu is a rabid dog of a war criminal and the Biden administration's inability to keep Israel on a leash threatens to tarnish the administration's foreign policy legacy.
3. A Trump administration frightens me on foreign policy. Trump was more lucky that he didn't have to handle serious crises like an invasion of Ukraine because was easily manipulated by Putin.

EDIT: I forgot to mention there was ALSO a period where once the war did start, Biden had to navigate the genuine possibility that Putin would use tactical nuclear missiles on Ukraine, marking the first use of weapons like that since WW2. Only after Xi Jinping and China, after discussions with the Biden administration, personally spoke with Putin did he change his mind on such an insane escalation.","lszwtr5"

The bare bones theory is that the CIA leaked a bunch of Nixon’s misdeeds to the press not out of any moral obligation but because he represented a threat to the CIA’s own efforts to shape foreign policy, many of which also came to light shortly after during the Church Committee in 1975.

The “Woodward was a CIA asset” line comes from his days in the Office of Naval Intelligence. While it’s all speculation, it’s not unreasonable to assume that some of his sources were from connections he had made during his former career.

As Beinart reported, Biden and his team wanted to handle the dispute privately. Obama’s camp took a different route by drawing up a list of demands to be made of Netanyahu. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton then gave the prime minister 24 hours to respond, warning him, “If you will not be able to comply, it might have unprecedented consequences on the bilateral relations of the kind never seen before.”
> 
> Biden was soon in touch with a stunned Netanayhu. A former administration official who saw the transcript of their call told Beinart that “Biden completely undercut the secretary of state and gave [Netanyahu] a strong indication that whatever was being planned in Washington was hotheadedness and he could defuse it when he got back.” When Clinton saw the transcript, she “realized she’d been thrown under the bus” by Biden, the official added.

*“The strategic stability architecture is rapidly disintegrating. NATO refuses to give constructive
consideration to our proposals for de-escalating tensions and preventing dangerous incidents. On the contrary, the Alliance’s military infrastructure is being irresponsibly moved closer to Russia’s borders, and anti-missile defence systems that could be used for missile strikes are being deployed in Romania and Poland. US medium-range missiles can appear any day now on European territory. The “nightmare” scenario of military confrontation that our continent experienced after the famous NATO Double-Track Decision is returning. Europe remains silent. Ukraine is being “pumped up” militarily, which fuels the Ukrainian Government’s desire to sabotage the Minsk agreements and fosters the illusion that the conflict can be resolved by force.
The decision of the NATO Bucharest Summit of April 2008 that “Georgia and Ukraine will become
members of NATO” was like a landmine placed beneath the very foundations of the European security architecture. It has already exploded once, in August 2008, when Mikheil Saakashvili, euphoric about the prospect of joining NATO, took a gamble that had dire consequences for Georgia itself and brought the security situation in Europe to a knife-edge.** 

***Those who mechanically repeat the points made in Bucharest and insist that “third countries” have no right to express their position on the issue of NATO enlargement are playing with fire. I am convinced that they cannot be unaware of this.”***


I see where Woodward made a mistake. I believe the paragraph should have been, “**Those [meaning the US]** who mechanically repeat the points made in Bucharest and insist that “third countries” have no right to express their position on the issue of NATO enlargement are playing with fire. I am convinced that they cannot be unaware of this.”

Then it describes it as initially the U.S. giving full support. But growing frustration from the Biden administration in as little as days. As soon as October 11th, during Blinken’s first meeting with Israel, he was asking “and what are your plans for humanitarian aid?”

Netanyahu said, “they will be moved to Egypt for humanitarian aid.”

Blinken basically thought… “what? No no, you need to provide them with aid”. 

Netanyahu basically responded with, “what? What do you mean “we” have to provide them with aid?”

The disconnect was very early on. And Biden becomes more and more irate. One U.S. official saying, “The Israelis always do this! They say ‘we have the intel, we have the intel, we’ll show it’ but they only have it 50% of the time!”

You're confusing the two. Israel lies to the USG. Frequently. And our interests are substantially different. Due to domestic political pressures, the US historically does not do anything about it, because the political ramifications for going against Israel have historically been substantial, largely due to donor pressure and extremely well funded interest groups like AIPAC. 

In an ideal world, would the US use its leverage against Israel to punish them and change their behavior? Yes. Would a strong, capable President do that and fight the political battles? Yes. Would a weak, timid compromising President pick that political fight, or would they go along with Israel no matter what Israel did because they didn't have the energy or the courage to actually make a public case for their actions and actually *change* the politics around the issue?

For the past 80 years, simply acknowledging Palestinians as human beings deserving of basic empathy has been deeply controversial in American political discourse, especially among legacy media outlets. Even today, even in liberal subreddits here, you can truly say some of the most racist, malicious stuff about Palestinians and get upvoted to the top of the page for it, even though most people would have no trouble recognizing the racism if it was about any other group. 

It's basically only been in the past year that the narrative of Israel being this triumphant nation valiantly defending itself from cartoonish anti-semitic hordes has been allowed to be questioned in America media, without that questioner's career being ruined. And even then the ingrained assumption is always ""Israel's actions are always just unless extensively proven otherwise, and a Palestinian is always evil unless extensively proven otherwise."" 

I could see Biden and other Dems looking at the state of things and assuming that backing Bibi's actions, no matter how heinous, is the ""safe"" political thing to do. (And sadly, he might be right? I don't think enough Americans are outraged enough to force their hands yet.)","lt04vf2"

I haven’t read the book yet, but I find it absurd to think Biden was privately maneuvering given the situation today. It’s exceedingly clear Bibi’s goal is not the return of the hostages. And the US’ stated goal of providing humanitarian aid is laughably ridiculous considering that they refuse to use their leverage to achieve it. Look at the “Humanitarian Pier” which was constructed and abandoned as opposed to forcing Israel to simply allow aid through the corridors into Gaza. The US has all of the leverage in this situation.

It's also not fair to judge a book and say it is without value unless you've read it. It's fair enough to say 'I don't like woodward because of his previous works or x,y,z so I'm not going to buy his book' but it's silly to say 'This book doesn't have any insights I cannot glean from reddit/news outlets/my favourite streamer'. 

You can look over my comment history if you want, I don't make excuses or concessions for what's happening in Israel/Palestine. It's wrong from an ethical perspective and daft from a geopolitical one.","lt0v15o"

You are like most reasonable people watching this tragedy, there is a massive WHY involved with the unconditional support Israel is given. I think when there are such large, unanswered questions you have to look everywhere you can for explanations.

I'm not sure what disqualifies this guy from your standards, I also don't really care. You don't have to read the book. Unless you have access to sources deep within politics however, I would probably trust what he has to say rather then going through the same tired question of 'why is the US so impotent on Israel?'. The book might actually give you some reasons as to why they are impotent and cannot wrangle Israel into line.","lt0lj14"

Point stands.","lt0xp3r"

"lt0zi0e","JFHermes","2024-10-21 16:24:08 UTC","Yeah dude, it's important to provide context. That comment is like 6 or 7 comments deep in a thread dedicated to the book talking specifically about the political unknowns that are influencing the conflict.

As I said elsewhere, I can't recommend the book because I haven't read it. I don't think anyone HAS to read this book to hold an opinion about the Israel/Palestine conflict. If you are interested in understanding why Israel is able to dictate terms to the global leviathan, then 'maybe you should read the book'.

nice gotchya though.","lt0ycsq"

I think there is a bit more nuance to this that is being ignored. Israel is making the Democrats look like chumps & it's possible they lose the election because of it. It doesn't make sense and while having a solid ally in the region is worth a lot to the US (and European allies) it doesn't explain why Netanyahu and his cabinet are happy to sink the probability of a term from Harris/Walz and how he has so much political capital to get away with it.

I'm probably going to pick up this book because whether you like him or not, it seems as though Netanyahu is punching above his weight and walking all over the US political class. It's embarrassing.

He sure is and it sure is. America looks like a client state of Israel.","lt0pxnw"

Ok, but theoretically they already have the Ukrainian money pit that they can grease up the MIC with. I think that would be better bang for your buck than throwing it into Israel's defence budget (considering they lost a dozen f-35's a few weeks ago).

There are a lot of inconsistencies with what's happening. It's illogical and as such there are probably a great deal of variables that we the public are not privy to. I'm not going to guarantee you're gonna find it in a bob woodward book but it's probably not a bad place to look.","lt0sg1y"
