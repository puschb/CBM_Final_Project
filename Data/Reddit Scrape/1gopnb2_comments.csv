**The Eyes are the Best Part, by Monika Kim**. ⭐️⭐️⭐️1/2. This was pretty messed up but I did overall enjoy it. It’s an allegory for the racism, oppression, and fetishization experienced by Asian women. It was a very slow burn and also very gory. But I really enjoyed the symbolism throughout! 

I’m also currently reading **How to Read a Book, by Monica Wood** and this is most likely going to be a 5 star for me.

"lwl3e9n","caught_red_wheeled","2024-11-11 14:42:17 UTC","Finished **Don Quixote de La Mancha Part II** in one shot! Unfortunately, it wasn’t really because I’ve found the book really good but I more or less wanted to get it out-of-the-way for completion. I didn’t really care for it, which was unsurprising because I felt the same way when I first found it existed. But I thought that I might enjoy it more if I put it into complete context. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. 

The book was meant to be more serious and better written, but I found what happened cruel considering what happens to both of them. And considering the first book had an ending where it made it seem like Don Quixote had died being recognized as a knight as much as the time could be, I thought it would satisfying to leave it there. I get that ending it where it was would’ve undermined the message with the idea of the nobility having to die out to continue to the next generation, but it still makes it a very tough read. I can see why most abridged renditions do not include the second part at all or only a little bit of it because that would be hard to modernize and would still lead to a pretty sad ending.

What was interesting was the many interpretations that the book had. The ones that interest me the most were that Don Quixote was actually ahead of his time. This interpretation makes the analysis that in the current world of things like role-play, video games, and generally with fantasy being much more common, Don Quixote living out a fantasy in some way and having a double identity (assuming he did it where appropriate) would’ve been much more accepted in the modern era. 

There was also the idea that he was trying to bring positivity and goodness to the world that was very bleak, but there just wasn’t a way to do that and he just didn’t know how to do it safely. Some of the parts, especially in the second book, hint at this being true and make it clear that no matter what, he was a good person. There is another interpretation that even adds extra lines, making it clear that Don Quixote and his squire really did care for each other, and when the latter passes away at the end, the flat out squire flat out states that if if you would called to go on an adventure again, he would gladly do so. 

So it makes you wonder what would happen if something like that story we written as something contemporary with more fantasy behind it, instead of the parody that it was. Considering the legendary figure that might became, one could argue that’s what pop culture sees it as. It’s an interesting observation. I’m going to head back into Charles Dickens now, but I’m not sure which book I’m going to do next. Regardless, after I’m done with Dickens I don’t have much left. Which is just as well considering classical literature can get pretty heavy…",""

**Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley**

I actually finished this last Friday or so, but just didn't really have the gumption to get back on social media after Tuesday. I didn't mean to read it during the election, but it was next in my TBR list.

Someone made the great comparison that BNW is the opposite side of the same coin as 1984; wherein one society is ruled by base pleasure, the other is ruled by base hatred. It is a very apt dystopia for what is currently going on with our world at this time with how messed up our dopamine reward systems are. In truth, considering it was published in the 30s and mores in contemporary society have changed so much, the story resembles less of a dystopia and more ""this society is different than ours, how scary,"" albeit that is still a bit of a strawman.

It is by no means a utopia; the society in the book still has a rigid caste system, and there are no genuine free choices to make other than those presented within it. But, as mentioned in the book, the populace is ""happy,"" oblivious to their potential, and are able to live in security. Essentially, an extremely comfortable version of Plato's cave. From my perspective, if you were not indoctrinated into the society, it would be especially lonely to live in with no family or genuine friends, just seeking the next dose of happy pills.

**Suttree, by Cormac McCarthy**  
If you’re familiar with Joel-Peter Witkin’s photography, this is what McCarthy’s world feels like to me—hypnotically grotesque and morbidly beautiful.

**Deathtrap, by Craig Alanson**  
I’ve only got 1 more Mavericks book left and then I’m totally caught up on the ExForce universe. This one, of course, didn’t have the Beer Can or the Merry Band of Pirates, which to me wasn’t a drawback at all, especially since I got more of Nert and Jates.  

**Deathword, by Harry Harrison**  
I’ve no idea why I thought this would be a funny book, it wasn’t (with the exception of that one joke near the end). After a short period of 'huh, this isn’t what I was expecting', it actually turned into quite an interesting, if somewhat superficial and hurried, conflict resolution plot. Now, to solve the Middle East conflict…  

**The Mysterious Stranger, by Mark Twain**  
Twain never got to finish this book. Instead, he left a number of patchy versions (I read The Chronicle of Young Satan one) that worked with the same theme – the absurd and contemptible nature of humanity, its skewed Moral Sense, and capacity for evil. This definitely spoke to the misanthrope in me.  

**Diary of a Madman, by Nikolai Gogol**  
Only took me 4 decades to get to this little gem.  

**Japan’s Infamous Unit 731, by Hal Gold**  
This book was arranged thematically rather than in a typical chronologically-linear fashion. I can see why the author did it and it does provide a much more rounded context to the last section of the book containing the personal accounts. I kinda wish there was a little bit more historical detail but, I’ve read other books on Japanese war crimes, so it wasn’t a big deal. I *was*, however, taken aback by the Fort Detrick AIDS reference, which is usually discredited as a conspiracy theory.

**Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards, by Jim Ottaviani & Big Time Attic**

I didn't realize this was historical fiction given it is based on the bone wars and does include a lot of real events. I liked they included what was real and what was fiction at the end, but I wish they would have referred back to the page the thing they were referring to was on. I also had a hard time keeping the characters straight because many looked too much alike. I understand this is partly because these people DID look alike in real life, but they explained how they altered Cope's appearance to differentiate him. I wish they had done that with some of the other characters. I thought there was some good humor in here, but ultimately it didn't fulfill the reason I read it, which was to learn more about the bone wars. I'll check out some of their references though to read about what actually happened. Also, just physically, the format of this book, being extra wide, made it difficult to read.

**Portus, by Jun Abe**

**Mythago Wood, by Robert Holdstock**

This fantasy novel was published in 1984 and has been on my to-read list for a very long time. It chronicles the exploration of a mysterious labyrinthine forest by the sons of George Huxley who was obsessed with the strange phenomena connected to the wood bordering the family estate. It's a fantastic read, combining myth, culture, history, and terror.

**The Moonstone, by Wilkie Collins**

Wilkie Collins has been referred to as the father of the English detective novel. This 1871 mystery novel is a classic in the genre. It recounts the theft of a sacred Hindu diamond and the efforts of Sergeant Cuff, the policeman investigating the crime, to solve the case. While the Victorian prose is typically formal and verbose, it's an excellent story with a variety of intriguing characters, particularly the intelligent and perceptive Cuff. Definitely worth reading.

**Mao - a Very Short Introduction, by Delia Davin**. Obviously growing up in the West we mostly only hear about Mao as one of history's greatest monsters. But years ago when I had a housemate from China I got a glimpse of the much more varied picture of Mao that they have. My friend described the Cultural Revolution as ""collective insanity"" and Mao's Little Red Book as ""intellectual junk food -- no nutritional value at all"", but still said he thought of Mao as a ""genius"". I recently was made aware of Maoist movements outside of China, including the fact that the Black Panthers in the USA in the 60s/70s considered themselves Maoists. So I'm curious to know more about this guy and what he actually did.

Jumping from Portugese traders in South Asia to Ottomans and Mamluks in the middle east to Mughals and Manchus and so on... it's getting a bit much. But it's nice to see the connections that I never really thought about before. Very good book, but I need to go through it slowly.

The Red Flannel Rag: Memories of an Appalachian Childhood by Peggy Shifflett

A self published book (that you can get on Amazon) about a very specific community that is extremely local to me personally, recommended by a friend. It’s more of an ethnographic sketch of an isolated Appalachian hamlet in the 30s-60s than a proper memoir. I do recommend if you like reading about old timey Appalachian folktales, farm life, family structures, witch healing, that kind of stuff. Lots of moonshining.

First book in the Richard Hannay series. A classic adventure story from 1915. Richard Hannay arrives in England from Rhodesia and finds life there rather boring until he meets his upstairs neighbor Franklin Scudder who asks him to hide in his flat because he wants to evade a group of men pursuing him. He admits Scudder and the man tells him a fantastic story about a plot to murder a soon to be arriving foreign dignitary. When Scudder turns up murdered, Hannay fears being implicated so he escapes on a train to Scotland with the notebook of the dead man. I found it very suspenseful and enjoyed the somewhat dated language and style. Written by a former Canadian Governor general, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir, it was filmed several times in 1935, 1959, 1978 and 2008. I will definitely read more of Buchan's work.

Lalli is her pen name for her mystery books) romance novels because I think she does a great job at representing Indian culture and the experience of indian-american young women, and I was pleased to see she kept that aspect for her mystery stories. Her characters in the more contemporary romance books are typically sweet, girl-next-door types, but in this book, the narrator is morally questionable and I do love my books about evil women (think, **A Certain Hunger, by Chelsea Summers** or **Luckiest Girl Alive, by Jessica Knoll**). I also try to read less-popular books, because while I enjoy cult faves like ACOTAR and Emily Henry, smaller authors need our reviews too!

  Currently 42% through and I like the story, but I don't want to make any calls yet until I see how the mystery unravels. I've recently read other mystery books, like **Thorn City, by Pamela Statz**, where the resolution of the case was so... simple that it was anticlimactic. I love a mystery book that balances a good build up with unpredictable plot twists at the end that still make sense when you think back on the story, like ""oh yeah, how did I miss that?""

Currently reading: The School for Good Mothers, by Jessamine Chan

Compelling and unsettling spec fic read about a school/prison where anyone deemed an ""unfit"" parent is forced to go under threat of losing custody of their children. I'm curious about how the currently-in-production TV adaptation will go about it. One thing I like about this book is how a lot of the moms (including the main character) *did* genuinely do something wrong - but that *still* does not excuse the School's treatment of them or make the School any less toxic or insane in regards to its ideas of childrearing. I like that the book delves into how a parent being imperfect, or genuinely flawed in a specific area, or just have a really really bad day does not a ""bad parent"" make. (The main character is sent to the School for leaving her 18-month-old unattended for 2 hours, which is obviously not okay - but the main character is a single mom whose ex-husband and his new girlfriend constantly overstep their boundaries, she struggles with insomnia and depression and was pressured into going off her medication, her job is stressful, and she literally has no friends in her current city. She could've hired a babysitter or asked the dad to take the kid for an extra day or put her daughter in daycare, and even she agrees she should've done that, but under the circumstances, you see why she kind of snapped and just wanted a couple hours to *not* be a mom. She obviously adores her daughter and overall does her best, but the whole situation was a perfect storm for her to do something very stupid.)",""

a heart-wrenching story about two sisters, Laura and Mary, who are orphaned under tragic circumstances. After their father kills their mother, he is imprisoned, leaving the young girls alone and vulnerable. They are placed in an orphanage where they face the hardships of institutional life and the emotional scars of their past.

As they grow older, Laura and Mary remain close, supporting each other as they navigate the challenges of life. Laura eventually marries a kind carpenter named Neil, who provides her with the stability and love she's longed for. Meanwhile, Mary, the younger sister, struggles with the trauma of her past and, despite finding love and having a child, battles deep inner turmoil that ultimately leads her to a tragic fate.

The novel captures the resilience of the sisters in the face of intense adversity, the bonds of family, and the impact of trauma on one's life and choices. It’s a powerful story about survival, love, and the importance of not being forgotten.",""

Finally finished Hobsbawm's quartet of modern histories, reading them in reverse order of publication. I started with The Age of Extremes, 1914-1991 and worked back from there. (I used to teach a second-year university module on contemporary economics that used readings in the Age of Extremes.)

Hobsbawm died in 2012 at a great age. He was in the 1960s and 1970s amongst the left-wing British historians such as E.P. Thompson and Christopher Hill who were such thorns in the sides of Tory-oriented academics and politicians. They were undermining historians and thus beloved amongst serious undergraduate history students. They wrote at a time when late-night debates in university dormitories about history and politics and economics were still fashionable, yet serious.

Anyway, The Age of Revolution is not narrative history, but like his other books, is thematic: economic development, economic thought, government, social development, arts, sciences etc. One theme stands out in this volume. The Age of Revolution mainly refers to ""the dual revolution"" of the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. These two revolutions are the ones that really count in world history and the author works that through all his other themes. For example, when it comes to his history of socialism or socialistic thought, Hobsbawm makes a distinction between a proto-socialism rooted in the Romantic tradition (think Rousseau) and shows how the dual revolution began to kill such proto-socialisms and transform it into something else (think what the the differences were between the 1830 and the 1848 uprisings and the thought behind them). Even to the sciences Hobsbawm is able to extend this kind of analysis.

Narrative histories are fun and have their place, but hard thought about broad themes in history really is where the action is and Hobsbawm was a great practitioner of it. Perhaps the greatest of the 20th century.",""

I also do not sleep like a normal person so my insomnia helps a lot. On average I probably read 3-4 hours a day maybe? I don’t have kids, much of a social life, and I don’t watch much tv.

tl;dr is that it kinda sucks as a history book, but it has some value in a metahistorical sense.

Long version:

It’s not an academically rigorous historical text, but rather a broad strokes narrative light on details and heavy on editorializing. In other words, it’s a pop history book. Which is neither necessarily bad nor unexpected (Tuchman considered herself a writer not a historian), but even by the standards of pop history it falls a bit short and that’s only exacerbated by the fact that pop history doesn’t age well. And this is a book published nearly 70 years ago.

Which brings me to my next point: Orientalism practically drips off the page throughout. Although understandable, as the book is a product of its time, it’s nevertheless still very off-putting. Tuchman also comes off seeming like a massive Anglophile, which might be fine for some people but felt weird to me.

All that said, I did still glean a few nuggets of insight into the history of Britain’s relationship with the Levant. And as someone deeply interested in and fairly well-read on Palestinian history, it was intriguing in a metahistorical sense.

In summary, an OK read for my purposes but not a book I would recommend to most people.","lwkqpuw"

There are some legit cool Sci-fi inspirational ideas in it like even though Sagan wasn't a sci-fi author you can tell he read all of them and was like I can tell one unique idea and I'm actually a practicing astrophysicist.


Like the movie which I'll assume you've seen doesn't really convey exactly what the Alien they meet is. It's not the Creator of this network it was just one of the thousands of alien species that found this. We introduce you this way because we don't know the true nature of this. It takes a while and perhaps your civilization will not make it into this network but we left the opportunity for it available. ","lx38t49"
