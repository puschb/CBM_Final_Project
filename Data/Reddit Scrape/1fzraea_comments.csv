It is not, it's another reality / timeline altogether where fascism in its many incarnations was actually defeated. It explicitly says racism was defeated in the US, which we're all aware is a fantasy in our reality. Plus the different president in charge, etc, it's an alternative history for us as readers too; both we as readers and the characters in the book are forced to grapple with normalized fascism within our respective societies.

PKD was ultimately suggesting we ended up in a different fascist-sympathetic timeline that normalized those behaviors. We may have defeated the Nazi's but the original evil still lurks and holds power. Given our current political circumstances, and the history he drew upon, he was obviously right on that account.",""

On the other hand there are the ones who see him as an irredeemable monster who does not deserve any sympathy. Both readings are equally wrong.

Catherine is frequently interpreted as a spoiled golddigging brat who is using both Heathcliff and Charles. While she is certainly immature, it’s much more accurate to see her as someone emotionally stunted from years of abuse, and that she thought she was taking advantage of an easy way out - only to misjudge horribly.

The actual character of the Monster is one of the most misunderstood characters in literary fiction in my opinion.  The monster was very intelligent and gentle.  He was driven to violence by his mistreatment at the hands of normal people and by the disregard he received from his maker.  He wanted nothing more than to be accepted and loved.

Because those who have not read the book have their image of the monster created by Hollywood, they believe him to be a lumbering, mentally retarded brute.

It's in the title. His innocence was stripped from him by those who should have been protecting him, and all he wants is to see that doesn't happen to anybody else. 

The entire point of the book soars over people's heads simply because they don't like him.

He's not likeable. 

Because he's broken.

He's been broken in a way which wasn't at all his fault. He was forced to grow up way too fast, and the end result is a young man who has somewhat gone over the edge and become a bit sociopathic. 

The metaphors for who Holden represents in the world are infinite.

Holden is a reminder that we are indeed - on a base level - our brothers' keeper. When we turn a blind eye, or we allow his abuse to become normalized, we ALL suffer the consequences. 

The manuscripts were in *Salinger's rucksack when he landed at Normandy on D-Day. He might not have been a child at the time, but asking a 24 year old to experience that is a bit much.

So essentially he grows up through loving and nurturing someone else. Because his sister isn't bitter and corrupted.","lr3embb"
"lrh53b0","monday_thru_thursday","2024-10-11 21:31:20 UTC","The misconception is that Holden is, more or less, a ""worthless protagonist.""

You have to understand that Catcher in the Rye wouldn't be a teenager's first book featuring a teenager (or child, in general). At various points in history, they'd have spunky heroes from detective stories, or children/teens in fantasy novels that take aim at authoritarian regimes and win, or even just real children making huge change while featured in nonfiction.

Here comes some semi-privileged kid who can barely even put a name to the sources of his oppression -- who simply whines and whines, and escapes into knowingly awful habits (smoking, booze, even as a teen). He's not cunning and funny; he's not destined to succeed. He's just some lame teenage boy. Who *cares*?

So, add in notions of ""deeper meaning"" and cries for ""a bit more empathy"" all you want, but depending on the audience, they just can't give a crap. Why care about yet another kid who, in the face of a widely-supported and unmovable set of traditions and values, does nothing but whine and escape?

That's why people don't like him. Or, more accurately, that's why teens aren't entirely in the wrong for not liking him. I'm thankful my high school never forced us to read Catcher, as it's just not appropriate for a kid to read -- especially kids who deserve to believe that anything is still possible and that those impossible institutions can be conquered and changed.","lr3embb"

Snape weighed his thoroughly evil beliefs and convictions against his friendship with Lily, and he decided that even though there was no chance in the world that he'd ever get any of that back, Lily's positive influence meant more to him than Voldemort's negative influence. I'm not excusing Snape abusing his power as a teacher or his actions as a death eater; but I think Snape is a commentary that you can believe all the racist things you want and surround yourself with likeminded people who agree with you, but at the end of the day, none of that is real.

Snape is fascinating because on a subconscious level he realizes this (hence why he continues to work for the side where absolutely nobody can stand him), but at the same time he's carnal and stubborn enough to continue clinging to his old ways in spite of all reason. It's more complicated than ""Snape never turned good."" I'd argue that it's not Lily that he loved as much as what Lily represented to him, and Snape lacked the emotional intelligence to realize this.

In fact it's a tragedy. He tries to avoid becoming a religious icon for jihad which claims milions on lives on multiple planets and fails badly. Despite his foreseeing powers -which in theory should only grant him freedom - all his choices seem to corner him and only make him a symbol used for carnage carried out in his name that he no longer has control over. He can't seem to outrun his destiny even if he sees it more clearly than an ordinary man. He becomes less than a man - a symbol in which others see what they want it to be.

His 'victory' is in fact a trap and a failure. Green Arrakis paradoxically brings about the end of spice and interstellar travel and the true Fremen.

Lots of talk about how „I know you’re supposed to keep going when a girl says to stop, but I never ever can;“ note how angry he gets at his roommate when he seduces the childhood friend (that he keeps saying he’ll call but never does). Then there’s the part where his teacher makes a pass on him, causing Holden to note that it’s happened many times before. His obsession with childlike innocence is another dead giveaway.
