We have monuments set up with political figures inside. Which is where your weird claim stems from. This isn't in any way connected to Christian Scientists (it predates them) and is in no way even unique in the Western World. 

These monuments were part of a larger art movement throughout North America and Europe to build replicas of antiquities called **[neoclassicism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism)**. Our monuments are simply copies off famous Greco-Roman antiquities. The reason we filled it with political figures rather than gods is because it was the Enlightenment, and we *specifically wanted to divide church and state and to celebrate real life heroes.* They're portrayed as gods specifically so Gods weren't put there instead.
