"ltnwim5","anna_holczer","2024-10-25 10:54:49 UTC","In the overall result, McCarthy does nothing but illustrate his characters' hellish journey in a dizzyingly elegant, meticulous and colourful way, despite the bleakness of his world. There is no sensational suffering or violent tragedy in the journey, but the author does not treat his reader with kid gloves, nor does he spare his reader any shameful pain. This is perfectly underlined by his trademark style, which is completely devoid of commas, but which is unfortunately much more frustrating in Hungarian than in English, which is much less reliant on punctuation, and brings with it, in addition to the desired sense of monotony, the constant need to reread and re-interpret complex sentences. And there is a lot of this, since, apart from the terse dialogue, the texts are almost exclusively descriptive (and thus clearly not recommended for those who are bored with The Lord of the Rings).

However, I feel that McCarthy's aim was not to create an immersive narrative, a grand journey, in fact, The Road is a very static story if that is the focus. However, if we can really be moved by the hopelessness surrounding the characters, by the fire that flickers within them in spite of this, if we can not only understand but also feel the bitter, painfully unravelling half-sentences of the father and son, then we are no longer dealing with a heartbreaking tragedy. But it is also true that not always, and not everyone, will succeed in becoming part of the almost illegible sentences and the soul-stirring atmosphere.

The Road is therefore in many ways not a pleasant read, but largely the kind that consciously tries to move the reader out of his or her comfort zone. It is a literary masterpiece, a piece of writing with an inimitable style and atmosphere, so it is recommended even though, given the film, it contains little that is new or special and for many it would probably be inferior to the novel in this comparison.",""

Either the director or Mortensen's choice was to push The Man's behavior more into fear on all ends. The ending is the same by beats, but I felt that it changed where The Boy was coming from emotionally. I think that the difference results in a novel that leaves you with absolutely zero hope, and a movie that leaves you with a teeny tiny distant glimmer of hope.","ltm82l8"

Which is part of the reason why I think the whole ""word for word"" adaptations thing is overrated. The movie and the book are different things and I think people care more than they should about how similar they are. The lord of the rings is a great adaptation and it changes plenty of things, and that's good because what works in paper doesn't necesarily work on the screen. Arrival is an excellent movie and it completely changes the story it adapts.

"ltob51p","Doct0rStabby","2024-10-25 12:44:50 UTC","Interesting tidbit, Cormack McCarthy originally wrote the story as a screenplay, and went around Hollywood (I believe in the 80's) trying to get it made into a movie but was repeatedly told ""no one wants to see that.""

So he made it into the book instead, and we're all kind of lucky it went down that way because a. we get an incredible novel and b. it was adapted to film by the masterful Coen brothers, with a perfect cast.","ltm8nlb"
"ltmg7so","Rhonda_Lime","2024-10-25 02:48:09 UTC","It's a masterpiece. Cormac McCarthy really knows how to craft dark, intense stories. Both books are incredible in their own way.","ltm8nlb"
"ltnwvog","anna_holczer","2024-10-25 10:58:00 UTC","I think that in the case of John Hillcoat's film, it is a very faithful adaptation, with almost all the essential moments of the novel intact, with only a few minor episodes left out of the mock version (not surprising given that it is a relatively short book. ) The effect is correspondingly similar, except of course for the differences in format: it is much easier to get out of a book (and you probably will if you don't read it in one sitting), so the atmosphere is less stifling, less soul-satisfying, but the many sensual passages, the exploration of the father's thoughts, make certain moments more effective.","ltmwxb4"

"ltntcmv","Deleted","2024-10-25 10:25:27 UTC","I respect that.  I can relate in that I had a very similar experience reading Breakfast of Champions for the first time, though that book is also a favorite now.  I think some of McCarthy's opinions on punctuation were a little odd, but I was and still am moved by the poetry I feel in his language.  (particularly in Blood Meridian). Even if now I sometimes get the sense of ""Cormac was really feeling himself when he wrote that last flourishing paragraph"".","ltn19dz"
"ltoimom","Doct0rStabby","2024-10-25 13:30:57 UTC","This is the second book in the Border Trilogy, and each are amazing in their own right. The third book, Cities of the Plain, is connected to the first two, but All the Pretty Horses and The Crossing can be read in either order. Of the three, the first book All the Pretty Horses is the least tragic and violent, so it is (unsurprisingly) a nice starting point in terms of pacing and story.

Slower pacing to the trilogy overall than works like The Road, No Country, Blood Meridian, Child of God. But beautiful, melancholic, tragic, inspiring, and deeply entwined with their setting. As is the McCarthy way.","ltmb0g3"

"ltqoo4x","QueenMaeve___","2024-10-25 20:16:01 UTC","Yeah I wasn't a fan either, but it seems to work for most people! Mostly I just felt I didn't really connect to the father or son, who did not act at all how I feel that he would've realistically (""but it's a metaphor!! It's bc of the message!!"" everybody tells me but I don't like that explanation lol). 

Like why would this kid, who pretty much grew up in the apocalypse, be so shocked and confused at the violence??? Why would be be so eager to help others or join the strangely convenient people at the end of the book when all of his life he has been told they are ""bad guys"" and ""dangerous""? Kids adapt so fast to even the most horrible situations (thou, if anything he would've likely been numb to it all while the father struggled more with it.","ltnp043"
