1. Characters that **sound exactly like each other**. If you often can't tell who's speaking from the dialogue alone, most likely every single character in that book is going to sound the same as well.
2. Using **too many meaningless words** in a sentence when a few would do.

Things I find annoying though, overdone phonetic spelling for character accents. I can manage it for bits of dialogue and to get a feel for a character, but sometimes it's just so much effort when it's overdone. Example done badly for me would be Feersum Enjin by Iain M Banks who is one of my favourite authors but that book was brutal. Example whee it's done well though is To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee, just enough to get a feel without being hard to read.

Bad editing, or just no editing, is also brutal. I read the worst edited copy of Sir Percy Leads the Band recently and it was distracting... I get that the automatic spellchecker wouldn't catch ""if"" instead of ""of"" (not that a spellchecker is good enough as an editor anyway) but it even had just misspelled words, one word just had the number 3 in the middle of it.... They didn't even run that edition through Microsoft Word for God's sake...

I do not want to hear ""in historical fiction women cannot be treated as capable under any circumstances"" just because YOU are incapable of imagining a female detective or a surgeon lol. It is not a matter of opinion that they did exist so I don't get why acknowledging that fact is a problem.

I guess you maybe mean ""for most of history sexism was the norm so historical fiction has to depict sexism in order to be valid"", but like... why? It's called fiction for a reason. If an author decides that female suffering is not essential to the plot then I don't get why they should be forced to include it anyway. It would be boring as shit if every historical novel had exclusively male casts solely because that would have been typical of the time period.","lvkq6n4"

I've never seen things that way but that's also true, just like its more famous opposite (the modern writing in historical context).

But coming at it from a straight sci-fi lens will leave you disappointed. And there seemed to be plenty of people who expected a particular experience of reading that just wasn't there, despite the marketing for this book not being straight sci-fi.
