In regards to the original topic... I had first read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and in my head I said Vogons like ""log-ons"" and Zaphod like ""zap hod"".

Later I listened to an audiobook of it and they said Vogons like ""vogue ons"" and Zaphod as ""zay [rhyming with 'day'] fod"".  Really bugged me since I had been saying it wrong apparently.

In the BBC TV adaptation and the 2005 movie they also say those names the same as the audiobook so I guess I was just wrong... But somehow the original way you assume a made-up word is said sticks with you",""

"lsp319i","SophiaofPrussia","2024-10-19 15:21:02 UTC","I was heartbroken when I bought my favorite novel as an audiobook and discovered the narrator says a main character‚Äôs name wrong **the entire book**. The book is [*The Silence of Scheherazade* by Defne Suman (translated from Turkish by Betsy G√∂ksel)](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/23a3a8bf-f439-4004-ace3-9eafdcedd57f) and it follows four loosely-interconnected women from diverse backgrounds (Greek, Turkish, Armenian, and Levantine French) in Smyrna during the fall of the Ottoman Empire. One of the main characters is Edith Lamarck, who is of French descent, and her French heritage is a key component of the story so one would assume her surname is French. But the narrator of the audiobook inexplicably adds an additional syllable to it and pronounces it as ‚ÄúLamarack‚Äù for the entire book. I always wonder how many hours of recording they did before they realized the error and decided to just stick with the wrong name for the whole book for the sake of consistency.

There‚Äôs also a scene where a character is giving birth and the mid-wife says ‚ÄúPersevere! Persevere!‚Äù and the narrator reads it as ‚ÄúPreserve! Preserve!‚Äù Like she‚Äôs making pickles or something.

I guess it‚Äôs for the best because the plot-lines are so interwoven and there are a lot of unannounced time-shifts and perspective-shifts that it‚Äôs difficult to fit the pieces of the puzzle together when listening to the book vs reading it.

You've got it the wrong way around.

What characterises rhotic accents is the pronunciation of the 'r' after a *vowel* when it's not followed by another vowel. So with a non-rhotic accent you would pronounce the r sound in ""arid"" but not at the end of ""bear.""

The only circumstances I can think of in which rhotic English accents pronounce '""r"" sounds after consonants' which non-rhotic speakers don't pronounce is in words ending in -re, like ""ogre,"" because when spoken the word behaves like a word ending in -er, like ""other.""

NICH\\ (rhymes with pitch). \\NICH\\ is the more common one and the older of the two pronunciations. It is the only pronunciation given for the word in all English dictionaries until the 20th century, when \\NEESH\\ was first listed as a pronunciation variant in Daniel Jones‚Äôs English Pronouncing Dictionary (1917). \\NEESH\\ wasn‚Äôt listed as a pronunciation in our dictionaries until our 1961 Webster‚Äôs Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, and it wasn‚Äôt entered into our smaller Merriam-Webster‚Äôs Collegiate Dictionary until 1993. Even then, it was marked in the Collegiate as a pronunciation that was in educated use but not considered acceptable until 2003.
All this is to say that the historical pronunciation has been \\NICH\\, and that \\NEESH\\ is a relative newcomer that came about likely under influence from French pronunciation conventions. At this point in time in the U.S., \\NICH\\ is still the more common pronunciation, but \\NEESH\\ is gaining ground. Our evidence suggests that in British English, \\NEESH\\ is now the more common pronunciation.","lss8f94"

Cernunnos and his close friend, the Green Man, appear a fair bit in his work :-)

Cernunnos was one of the OG gods in pre-Christian Europe and, as a result, is frequently used as a figure in fantasy and folk horror, either in written form or in other media, such as TV, or video games.

He also sometimes gets combined with the Green Man and they are turned into a single character but I think it may be more correct to say that the Green Man is just one possible aspect of Cernunnos, just as he can also lead the Wild Hunt?","lsnth3o"

A linking r involves **pronouncing an r sound where there is an r** for the purpose of separating vowel sounds.

"lsofind","EmmaInFrance","2024-10-19 12:51:49 UTC","I don't know if you've ever watched The Last Leg with Adam Hills. It's originally shown on the UK's Channel 4, but I believe it's also shown in Australia?

He frequently gets ribbed by his British co-hosts, Josh and Alex, for his Australian pronunciation of certain words!

Data is one that comes up fairly often, as he reads out news reports, usually prior to mocking something a politician has said or done, sometimes getting pretty ranty and scathing, when at his best!

FWIW, if I start thinking about the difference in how pergola is pronounced in the UK to in Australia and then how it would be pronounced in Italian (I did actually study Italian a very long time ago for both O and A level), then the difference comes in where the stress is placed.

It's all about the difference in rise and fall when speaking generally, and which specific syllable in the word gets stressed as well.

British English tends to put the most stress the first syllable but depending on the regional accent, that level of stress can be barely noticeable or really heavy.

The difference in general rise and fall would depend on the specific British regional accent.

In a softer regional accent, it might have the least rise and fall, with Australian second and Italian first, but a strong regional accent such as Glaswegian or Scouse or Geordie is right back up there!

I have a slightly posh, with a barely there Welsh accent and when I stress that first syllable, the difference is there but it's just enough to sound right, barely there.

I'm just imagining how the Scottish comedian Kevin Bridges would probably say 'pergola' and he'd definitely heavily emphasise the first syllable, I think, with much more rise and fall. 

You don't have to concentrate hard to hear the stress on syllables when he speaks!

In Italian, (just like Welsh) the stress is placed when speaking is placed on the penultimate syllable - unless there is an accent to indicate where to place the stress.

So, it's per-GO-la in Italian.

Listening to that clip, I think that the pronunciation is also putting the stress on the penultimate syllable but Australian English doesn't use the Italian vowel sound for *per* (closer to 'pear'), but the anglicised vowel sound, which is why it sounds odd to non-Australian ears.

A quick Google also told me that in American English, the stress is often placed on the last syllable of a word.

Knowing where to place the stress in words is such a critical part of language learning, as I found out by being such a language geek decades ago, in my teens!","lsnt1ju"

Interestingly, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was also a lot of Italian immigration to Glasgow and to South Wales, where I'm from, which is how my school ended up with an Italian teacher and able to offer A level Italian.

They moved there for work - to Glasgow for the shipbuilding, I presume, and in South Wales, Cardiff and Newport, at one point in the 19th Century, were the largest ports in the world, due to the mining industry and the export of coal from the area.

In South Wales, many Italian families opened caf√©s called brachis, as well as bakeries and ice cream shops.

There were still quite a few still open right up until Covid, but now, I think, only the very biggest have survived, like Sidolis in Bridgend and Porthcawl?
