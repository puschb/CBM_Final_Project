Werewolf of fever swamp - classic, one of the OGs, and a great melancholic ending iirc

The beast from the East - excellent world building, terrific twist, I remember being on the edge of my seat

One day at horror land - similarly great world building iirc, just a good scare left and right. A romp as it were.

The horror at camp jelly jam - this was a slow burn iirc, very much a sense of foreboding dread. Maybe I was just one of those kids who got sent to camp too much (so it resonated) but this one slapped.

The haunted school - I truly forgot about this one until I was looking through the list but holy hell, HOW did I? What a book. I remember this one vividly now. Might be the only one I want to revisit as an adult.",""

I then found it while we were moving and then sometime after, lost it forever not long after that! 😭😭","lr7ly4r"

Say cheese and die is such a cool title!","lr8q75l"

I’m remembering more now, that one was so odd that it inspired me to write my own knock-off series when I was in like 4th or 5th grade I think. I still have one I wrote about a haunted booger and it still makes me laugh bc the cover art I made for it is beyond obnoxious lol","lr6e5qe"
