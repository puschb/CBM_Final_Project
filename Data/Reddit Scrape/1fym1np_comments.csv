"lqx2zw2","DreadPirateGriswold","2024-10-08 10:31:14 UTC","[Serious] This sounds like a bit of good self-disclosure about writing.  But what does human authored vs. AI authored mean?

If a person were to use an AI tool to say generate the first version of an outline of a book they want to write and they actually write all the content themselves, is that human authored because you used an AI tool at some point in the process?

What about the case where a first draft version is generated by AI but extensively edited and added to by the author? Is that considered AI authored or human authored?

Human authored versus AI authored is a spectrum that runs from all human writing with no AI tool involvement all the way to all AI generated text with little or no human involvement.

But that also begs the question, if the author does not disclose that an AI tool was used somewhere in their process of writing and just claimed they wrote it all themselves without any AI tools, you're taking the author's word for it.

There is no test now to put text through some kind of technology that detects AI written text with any degree of accuracy high enough to be relied upon.

Thing is, AI can already replicate human art well enough for the vast majority to not being able to tell. Text is especially vulnerable as there is no single tell-tale and whenever one arises, it also means a prompt can identify and counter that. 

The irony is, the best AI detection software is always one step behind the best AI, because, in simple terms, the AI just analyzes the detectors and sees what it must and must not to do to keep it down to zero. You could probably literally tell the automatics to run iterations of the text until the checker clears out with 0%.

Nothing about file paths, extensions, error messages or anything really. All the text appeared to be generated from the function names, and it knew exactly as much as I did - that a ""save function"" allowed you to save things.

Everyone involved in the publishing company will need to keep it secret that they use AI language models to generate entire books - or large portions of them - in the writing. There will be digital fingerprints of these language models and the software used to edit and then eventually publish and print the books - or sell them digitally. The company will need its own proprietary language models, or else it will be contracting work to other entities, making the secret harder to keep. That proprietary model will need to be based on some kind of server, somewhere. It will need administrators, writers, and coders to maintain and improve or expand it over time. All of this will make the company extremely suspicious-looking if it is trying to lie about how its books are written. 

I don't think that any company could operate at scale for very long successfully lying about using AI. 

Could individual, contract authors possibly use AI sparingly to ""assist"" their writing? Yes. Will that be harder to prove in court? Absolutely. And that's fine. Individual authors ""getting away with"" using AI to help them is not the big fear I or anyone else has.

The government's ability to enforce the laws properly depends on the quality of the laws and the political will to update and adjust those laws and fund and oversee the implementation of those laws. It has very little to do with whether it is possible for the government to do a good job reasonably raising the standards for the products we consume.

AI misinformation (of which a ""flood of lazily-published books with mediocre robot-writing"" is a part of) isn't some brand new thing, it's just the same old song of misinfo we've been struggling against for all of human existence, and particularly since the internet turned into a giant echo chamber where people regurgitate things they heard with confidence, much like Reddit every time the topic of AI, how it works, and who benefits from it comes up.

People are going to have to trust institutions. This is the way we have always combated misinformation - journalistic institutions trusted by the public to investigate and unveil the truth. The best solution imo are organizations of those in creative industries that are able to label their peers as authentic writers, rather than attempting to force some label on every creative work in existence.

Amazon has top 100 pages for a ton of different subgenres. At times, some of those top 100 pages will be dominated by AI books.

The other thing to consider... when you're using the term ""company,"" I sense that you are thinking of ""Penguin Random House"" or ""Simon & Schuster."" But there are a ton of unsavory ""publishers"" out there, based out of a country with close to nonexistent copyright rules, that have been flooding the market with low-quality books for years. The game used to be to hire ghostwriters, give them a book to copy or 2 or 3 books to create a mashup of, and have them create a Frankenbook that is reworded just enough to slip under the radar.

>AI misinformation isn't some brand new thing

It is pretty new. Not sure what you're driving at here anyway, its newness doesn't really seem to me to be a significant factor in this discussion. If something needs to be regulated, how long it has been unregulated is sort of irrelevant. Cigarettes were unregulated for a long time, then we regulated it. Seatbelts weren't required in cars for a while, until we made them required. 


>The best solution imo are organizations of those in creative industries that are able to label their peers as authentic writers, rather than attempting to force some label on every creative work in existence.

The ""free market of ideas"" approach? The ""do you own research, consumer of everyday products,"" approach? People's attention is limited. Relying on optional, supplemental journalism - an industry which already exists and is sort of already as saturated/significant as it will likely become - is a dubious proposition. The problem isn't that people can't judge good quality or subjective preferences on their own, the problem is that AI-generated books threaten the creative work industry by making it increasingly more difficult for actual creative people to make money. They can be outspent on marketing, preferential shelf placement, etc. We have seen this across so many unregulated consumer industries. The cost savings that comes from AI-generated content compared to author's pay, ownership rights, royalties, etc, are so massive even for a mediocre-selling book, that companies who may want to utilize AI will succeed in displacing a significant number of authors, which will reduce the quality of the narratives we read. 

>who would be verifying and enforcing this law? 

How are any laws ""verified and enforced?"" By fact-finding, fines, and if necessary, lawsuits. That's how it works for everything else, all across the world. If the law says if you used AI to generate a book you have to label it, and you publish a book using only AI, then you are risking getting fined or sued for breaking the law. ""How would one find out?"" Well, if you don't have real authors willing to lie to the public and keep your secrets, then you're going to have a hard time operating a business that blatantly illegal. How could people know if everyone keeps their secret? If you sell millions of copies of a book, you're going to have people recognize content that, say, was clearly generated by some AI large language model. If there's convincing evidence, then maybe it'll go to trial. Then facts are discovered. That is just how the fucking world works, pal. For every single industry in the world.

This requires evidence. The obvious issue is, given a finished product, you cannot distinguish with any real accuracy what was human or AI made. And you can't police the use of AI models without going full authoritarian (guess how much I love our privacy being invaded by the fascists in power or their big tech corporate lapdogs), they already run on consumer hardware, especially llms which are very low demand. The only effective ways to police AI are A) to make the models akin to child porn or something, criminalizing the possession of them, which is ludicrous for many reasons, but most importantly will just never happen without carve outs for big businesses, or B) criminalize the training, which would then just shift over to Europe and Asia and they would pull ahead of us in a crucial technology.

No, he wasn't. Here's his comment again:

If interpreted generously, ""editing and typing"" could be considered to be about spellcheckers, but I disagree that's what he meant. Editing is far, far more than spellchecking. Not sure what they meant by typing. But even if we do concede that by those he meant ""spellchecking"", boiling the topic down to spellcheckers completely ignores the majority of his comment.

And sure, that *would* be a slippery slope fallacy if anyone had ever made that argument. Please quote exactly where anyone did. I didn't, and nor did the person who my comment was about. Their point was very different to what you are claiming, and I genuinely have no idea how you think this is about spellcheckers.

> It's obviously intended for books in which AI was used in the role of co-writer, not just a proofreader. 

Yes, and his point was *how much does the AI need to have been involved before such a label is warranted?* That's nothing to do with spellcheckers and is a valid question that will need to be answered at some point. AI could be used as part of the creative process anywhere from a tiny amount, perhaps suggesting a couple of names for characters, all the way up to writing the entire thing. He was asking ""At what point along that line should the use of AI be declared?""

I covered all this in my original comment. Did you actually bother to read it? If so, where on earth did you get this nonsense about spellcheckers from? Especially since spellcheckers have existed for decades and we don't need AI to spell check.

Edit: I'll add a bit more about how AI can be used for editing in ways that go beyond spellcheckers, but isn't the AI simply writing. Let's take this extremely poorly written and clumsy sentence:

> The weary traveller wearily stopped to catch his breath, his breath coming raggedly as he panted, catching his breath.

A spellchecker will have no issue with it. It introduces several elements that have come from the author - a traveller, that the traveller is weary, that the traveller is catching his breath, that the travel is breathing heavily. The creation of the scene comes from the author, and the core elements of the sentence come from the author.

Let's put that sentence into ChatGPT with the request ""Please edit this sentence to be better."" No instruction given beyond editing it and making it ""better."" A human editor would immediately notice the repetition and how poorly the sentence flows. They'd try to remove some of the repeated words such as ""wearily"" and ""catch his breath"". This is what ChatGPT does to edit the sentence:

> Here’s an improved version of the sentence:

> The weary traveler paused to catch his breath, panting as his chest heaved with exhaustion. 

> This revision eliminates repetition and creates a smoother flow.

It does exactly what a human editor would do, noting and removing the repitions and improving the flow of the sentence. A human came up with the character and the situation and what was happening. The AI edited it. Who wrote the sentence? Who created it? Who should get credit for it? 

I'd argue both, and with enough input from the AI to warrant it receiving at minimum an editor credit. If that's the only sentence the AI edited, should the book be given the ""Written with AI"" label? What about if every sentence is like that? How many sentences need to be edited, and to what extent, before a book deserves the label? A human still created the world and the characters and the story and the events that take place, so it's still written by a human. But does the AI deserve co-author credit? What about if the human write everything else but asks an AI to supply a specific character's dialogue? Both these examples seem to call for the label, but ""Written by AI"" would be wrong in both cases, which is why I went with ""Written with AI"". But in both cases even that implies a lack of human involvement.

There *are* many books these days that are 100% written by an AI. But for everything else there's only shades of grey. Those shades of grey are what OP was drawing attention to, and it was immediately and condescendingly dismissed. But it's a discussion that needs to be had and there are lines that are eventually going to be drawn and leglislated. Personally I find it interesting to think about where those lines should be. And asking about the lines drawn and the extremes of where they can be is not a slippery slope fallacy. Mainly because no argument is being made to be judged as fallacious or not.","lr01az2"

Communism is famously characterized by a complete *lack of markets*, comrade. Not sure what communist theory you think you've read, but you're either a liar or very severely confused. 

>Explain how labeling things as ""AI generated"" rather than labeling a smaller group of things as confirmed authentic is going to lead to consumers acting differently?

Okay so if it's not going to cause any different consumer behavior, then why should companies hate doing it so much? Most of your complaints prior to this point were pretty much identical to any rightwing, libertarian-minded, pro-business lamenting of difficulty, hardship, and unfair requirements. It seems you're sort of shifting here. I do think people will be less likely to buy books that are labeled as having been written using AI tools. Putting the onus onto human authors to say they are ""authentic"" shifts the burden of labeling and proving you're not a robot onto people, while allowing companies to simply pretend they are doing a normal thing by writing books with robots. 

>And you can't police the use of AI models without going full authoritarian

Look, I'm a socialist, I don't think communism is inherently more authoritatian than any other system, but you are using the same exact kind of language that rightwing libertarian groups use to lament every single regulation against a company. You are fighting on the side of private, for-profit companies. There's no way you're a communist. And this rhetoric is nothing but rightwing drivel.","lqxvsm6"

We live in a capitalist society, the realities we are dealing with are those of the market. We achieve nothing by pretending otherwise. Marx was pretty interested in the political realities of capital. Unless you have a communist utopia on hand you've kept hidden beneath your bed? 

>Putting the onus onto human authors to say they are ""authentic"" shifts the burden of labeling and proving you're not a robot onto people

The burden of proving you aren't a robot would be if we forced everyone to say, under threat of legal punishment, whether or not they used a tool? What do you know, everyone says they didn't, and we have no way to prove otherwise, better spin up those Salem witch trials again.

As opposed to artists just vouching for each other and creating networks of verified art.

>You are fighting on the side of private, for-profit companies

I'm sorry, remind who heads the copyright alliance? It's Disney, and they don't give a shit about small artists except to steal from them.

There are companies on both sides of this issue. Even if there weren't, the reality is that the tech is here and it is too small and easy to duplicate and use to eliminate. We need solutions that don't boil down to pointing fingers at each other for the rest of all time. Workers vouching for each other is the best way I can see that happening.

>exact kind of language that rightwing libertarian groups use to lament every single regulation

I can already fine-tune existing models on my local desktop computer.

Personally, as I said above, iteration feels like the most ""superpower"" way of using AI for writing. You can try this out. Ask an AI to write a two-sentence short story on whatever theme you like. Then revise it however you like and ask it to revise what you wrote, and keep going back and forth until you like the result.

You can go first if you prefer a stronger voice in the final product.

Here's a trivial example. See if you can spot the AI-contributed elements vs. my own:

""In the neon-lit underbelly of 2054 Seattle, Media sat amidst piles of old decks, anonymizers, and military surplus drone brains, struggling to tame the fledgling AI that had managed to spy on every megacorp's most secret transactions.

It's a new technology and it's still developing. I expect probably someday, and possibly soon.

I don't believe a secret like that could be kept up very long. 

Now could individual authors use AI to ""help"" them finish a story? Yes. And would this be much harder to prove or police? Absolutely. And that's fine, because the problem isn't that we're afraid of individual Authors leaning on some tools to help them do some of the grunt work of writing long stories - especially not if they scrutinize and edit to ensure the quality. The problem is that we don't want Venture Capital money-perverts running companies lazily churning out books using robot software while displacing real authors, making it harder for actual writers to be gainfully employed while creating the best work. 

And such a regulation easily captures the latter while being quite permissive of the former.

>Marx was pretty interested in the political realities of capital

That's not what you're doing though. You are actively fighting on the side of large capital businesses and private wealth generation which is likely to displace more laborers and make more people in the book-writing industry more dependent on large publishers. This is literally the opposite of what any leftwing person wants, whether they are a liberal or a socdem or a communist.

Which clearly will have to hide the fact that they are doing this from US authorities to bypass a law that would simply require them to put a label on their bookcovers. 

Even if you could continuously train and fine-tune large-language models capable of churning out whole books with the computational power of a single laptop in the next 2-5 years, you still have the actual *data* of those books and the editing that goes into it. You will still need employees who will know they are breaking the law and you will have digital breadcrumbs of the entire process.

It doesn't mandate how you're allowed to write. It mandates that if you are a publisher and you knowingly publish work which was written with the use of AI, then you must add a note on the book's cover.

Except the internet is *full* of this shit, everywhere. Every time someone sniffs AI, the mob is out with pitchforks.

If you earnestly want to regulate large businesses from doing *literally anything*, I'm there with you. The issue is that this is not how the idea has been presented, even here in this thread. People are rallying behind copyright arguments about how AI training ""stole"" their public-access data and Disney hopped on that train *immediately*, for good reason.

I still think independent coalitions of artists supporting and promoting each other's works is far more practical than a top-down regulation, the problem is it would take all these people who are spending all day scrutinizing every post for a stray pixel actual effort to set up, rather than just saying they want vague regulation that will never actually come to pass.

The commonly proposed vague feeling of a regulation would be disastrous because that's what happens when regulation isn't very specifically targeted. We have regulatory capture on every level of government, if the proposal isn't specific and targeted it *will* be co-opted to serve business interests and create AI monopolies.","lqy522r"
