Same here. The first time bateman rapes, kills and dismembers a woman, it's shocking. The fifteenth time, it just feels like the book is just about raping, killing and dismembering women. It's not provocative, it's not innovative, it's not even particularly interesting. The whole book is just *boring*. And Bateman himself is also massively boring because he's barely even a character--and since the rest of the cast is filtered through his eyes, they're all boring as well.

It feels like two books stuck together. The first half is actually quite good, especially the business card scene. That one made me laugh out loud. So did the running gag of people mistaking Bateman for someone else. It works because Bateman unintentionally makes himself a figure of ridicule in a way that is so obvious to the reader but he himself totally misses. Then he just starts... killing people. A few dudes, but mainly women. In graphic detail. For no apparent reason. His murder spree doesn't go anywhere, it doesn't say anything, there is literally no fucking point, even at the ending, which is barely an ending at all. The book went from an easy 4/5 to a total wash. Such a confusing choice.","lpoq8dc"

""Um, but all his takes were nothing but complaints""

Nobody was accusing you of saying that the book should be banned (indeed that is a strawman, as that argument could not be taken by a reasonable mind from what I said, so it is likely to be a purposeful misrepresentation), however, when somebody stated they wanted to read it for themselves, you took exception and essentially echoed your post in TL;Dr form, as if what you were saying were statement of fact rather than merely opinion.

Do not pretend as if you were *not* incredulous at their decision to read it themselves.

We all have a web of subjective life experiences that lead us to view stimuli and even facts differently.  We are constantly making connections in our mental models of the world.  Perhaps to you, Ellis was merely complaining, but to that commenter, it would *not* appear as such because of their own experiences. 

The best thing about books is that they aren't real, that people can come away with dramatically different understandings is a feature, not a bug.  

Your review will be helpful for people that are like you.  Based on the fact that comments desiring to read this book have been highly downvoted, while your own opinions are highly upvoted, it can be inferred (in a preliminary fashion) that those who want to read this book despite your review are *not* like you (or the part of the sub that found its way to your post).

Therefore, simply restating your conclusion as a de facto objection to their comment signals that you believe your review has some sort of truth merit to it, which it does not.

Hence my comment.","lpqsum0"

¬†I think you‚Äôre also misinterpreting his original response as well. He didn‚Äôt say he shouldn‚Äôt read it because he disagrees with its content. Rather that he believes the original commenter is seeking out something he claims to want to avoid ie pointing out the hypocrisy.¬†","lps5gse"

"lpybh6a","TheManWithThreePlans","2024-10-02 10:01:56 UTC","That's a fair point, however, I believe that this assumes that the commenter would readily contradict themselves in this manner.  This, in my view is uncharitable, and it may be more likely that the disconnect is semantic in such cases.

A Google search of the word complaint has the definition as ""expressing discontent or annoyance"", which would end up classifying much as complaining that I'm fairly certain many people would *not* classify as complaining.  For instance, were I to say ""the winner-take-all electoral system in the US is stupid because it produces candidates that do not represent Americans and desperately needs reform"" would be categorized as complaining while people that agree with this sentiment would see it as only descriptive of an actual issue.

The Oxford English Dictionary has the current sense of the word defined as: ""The expression of suffering passing into that of grievance and blame""

Which I feel is more in line with what the commenter would be referring to without resorting to assuming that the commenter has contradicted themselves in only a single sentence.

Going back to my own comment about subjective models of the world, what one may consider ""complaining"" is not objective, but subject to one's beliefs about the issues being discussed.

If one sees the content as an accurate representation of the world as it is, they would not classify the content as complaining, instead it would be merely descriptive.

If one did not share such views and felt the issues of current society lay elsewhere, such finger pointing *would* just seem like complaining in the current sense.

So, while I do agree that the OP was trying to point out hypocrisy, the attempt itself makes me believe that OP believes that there was truth value to the claims they were making.  That or they were deliberately being uncharitable to the commenter.  The second reading I believe is worse than the first.","lpxy97v"
