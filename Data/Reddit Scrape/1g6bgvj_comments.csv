The books demonstrated healthy emotional responses that are not always highlighted or included in other genres geared towards younger audiences. 

It‚Äôs an interesting thing to see pointed out since I grew up reading a lot of these books and they really taught me to be empathetic and to think about how other people have their own inner lives and I never even realized it until now.",""

I truly have no idea how I first heard about it, but it took me a few years to track down a copy and when I finally got around to reading it I realized that I was *way* outside the intended audience; the long and short of it is that the story's about a clockwork doll in some sort of vaguely pre-Industrial world who wants to be her own person but is stuck in a bad relationship with the person who made her because he still has the literal key to her literal clockwork heart that she needs wound to stay alive.

And I can be the first to admit they often had questionable themes and the girls often did terrible things, which often included being awful to each other. 

Like the time Mary Anne got shunned because she dared to cut her hair and buy some new clothes. Or when they got mad at Claudia for making a new friend and messed up her room and left her mean notes. Or when Mallory wanted to join the club and they made her do all of these ridiculous tests that no one else had to do. Or when Stacey got accused by her best friend of stealing a domain ring from a client. Or how Kristy was just an awful person starting about halfway through the series and was so insane about the club that the rest of the girls were afraid of getting into trouble by almost being late. And these are things I remember off the top of my head and are just examples of how they were not as close as they claimed they were. They were often mean-spirited and judgemental to people not exactly like themselves  and usually made terrible decisions when it came to most of the conflicts they dealt with.

I don't remember getting any stick for it - clearly not enough that it put me off reading them.

And also - maybe I'm just being terribly unfair to the Babysitters Club books, which as mentioned I never read, maybe they really are that special - but I don't think any of the many, quality ""girls books"" I read made a massive impact on my emotional intelligence.

At first we thought we were being cheeky reading 'Girl Books', but I loved it. The book was a lot more relatable than I had imagined, ""who knew girls and boys aren't so different?"" It also gave me insight into a perspective I had no real understanding of, I didn't have sisters, my friends had much younger sisters, so girls my age were just a different world.

I remember the incredulity at my reading a book written by a Christian woman for Christian girls struggling with young adulthood in a modern society that is full of challenges to Christianity's spiritual principals. No matter where I fell on any of the authors shared thoughts and opinions, or her belief system, am I not a more well rounded person for exposing myself to a vastly different perspective and experience? Did that not grant me a greater ability to see outside myself, challenge my worldview from a new angle, and compare and contrast my own beliefs and experiences? It did.

That's a lot of rhetorical questioning to poorly mask some leftover childhood rage. The number of peers who proudly refused to read a single book while condemning others for reading outside their demographic for the sake of perspective... yeah every book is for everyone.

Where the hell even is critical thinking anymore? It doesn't exist. I feel like every year I've watched it slip further away along with basic reading comprehension.",""

When I was a kid, I was reading stuff like Charmed Life by Diana Wynne Jones (still one of my favorite authors), and that did not seem to me to be particularly aimed at boys or girls. I had no idea that there were books aimed specifically at girls, but I also have no idea why those books would be seen as more ""emotionally intelligent"" then the books I read. It sounds like a rather sexist clich√© in my opinion.

When I was a teenager, I attempted to read my mother's chick lit books, and soon stopped because of the amount of sexual assault in those books (either my mother prefers reading really trashy bodice rippers, or maybe most of the romance genre at the time really was like that, who knows?). ""Emotionally intelligent"" they weren't, that's for sure.

I adored this book and first started reading her with the Shopaholic series once upon a time but have been a way bigger fan of the one off novels like this that she‚Äôs written. Also haven‚Äôt read that series in a decade plus so it would be fun to revisit-I still remember exact descriptions of pairs of shoes from those books, particularly one with a tiny clementine and a tiny blackberry that sounded so utterly exquisite, ha! 

I‚Äôll admit that I don‚Äôt mention her enough as a writer because of silly internalized nonsense where I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs not ‚Äúserious‚Äù enough but screw that, she‚Äôs an excellent writer and vivid storyteller and I find it quite easy to emotionally invest in her characters.

Men get mocked out of doing feminine hobbies and activities because of the closeness it has to being womanly (and all the negative things associated with that like being weak/frivolous) but on the other hand, men still get paid more than their women counterparts even when they have the same job. Men also tend to be seen as artists/maestros when women are seen as hobbyists. An example of this would be how sewing is seen as a feminine hobby and yet many of the iconic fashion designers of our time are men. 

To really step forward, I think there would need to be enough men who are willing to change the minds of their male friends and family on how they equate femininity with being inferior.","lshv161"

More generally I've been asking myself why there are no books/resources on etiquette for boys. This came to mind last week when I was waiting for a bus and there were different groups of boys and young men hanging around, and their every other word was fuck or shit or something equally illiterate. These guys could not express themselves without swearing. 

They don't know how to talk, they don't know how to behave in public, and amongst each other they don't know how to have polite conversation. And this all seems so typical.

There are also books in that vein with female protagonists but I feel there are less of them, and when they are there (such as The Dork Diaries, or the Dutch book/YouTube series De Zoete Zusjes) many of the covers look very pink and frilly.

If men like them then there‚Äôs something wrong with them because why wouldn‚Äôt they enjoy the much better more typically masculine activities? Hence why I said if you‚Äôd like to see change, it really starts with men talking to other men and having deeper relationships with their male peers because the most bigoted men will not listen to their female peers. 

Unrelated thought but I just want to say that a lot of men see women who do not act overly friendly or they just act indifferent towards them as man-hating even when it‚Äôs a neutral stance.

Toxic masculinity is the _subset_ of masculinity that exists in opposition to healthy masculinity. It doesn't say {masculinity is toxic}, it says {masculinity _that is_ toxic}. Just like when someone says ""venomous snake"", they aren't saying all snakes are venomous. This isn't a matter of what I ""think""; that is the working definition, and really how adjectives are used in the English language.

The next time you see a discussion like this, especially under an article that is visibly in support of good things for boys and men, try not to automatically take a combative stance. It's not hard. Just ask questions instead of leaping to assumptions. You're doing yourself a disservice otherwise.

There was no psychiatric therapy, the only medications for mental illness were sedatives (laudanum, i.e. morphine), and mental asylums were terrible places. 

You can argue that we only have his word for it that she even is - or was, before being locked away - mentally ill, but if you take the text at face value, Bertha appears to be well-cared for by the standards of the time and the resources available.","lsismoe"

I know among lower income families they still do, usually using family or close friends, because they *literally* can't afford to pay what professional childcare costs. But I base this off the consensus among people my age, who have kids from infancy through middle school at this point. They generally don't think it's appropriate to hire teens to watch their kids, to the point of considering it poor parenting to do so. Nobody asks each other for sitter recommendations anymore. When they *have* to have a sitter, they usually use a grandparent or drop the kids off for a ""playdate""/""sleepover"" at a family friend's house(with an expectation that the favor will be returned), but it's far less often than our parents did for sure. Kids also get dragged to a lot of functions(weddings, etc) that they honestly shouldn't be at.","lskd2wk"

Could be wrong tho, it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve read my bio of the Brontes.

Jane Eyre is a banger. So is Wuthering Heights.  Agnes Grey‚Äôs a bit weak but the Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a brutally merciless examination of the effect of alcoholism on a marriage, especially considering the time it was written.

She's normally cared for solely by an older woman, and Adele lives there for years without even knowing Bertha is there. The problem is that he knowingly set off Bertha by coming back to Thornfield.

I'd argue that Blanche Ingram is the one Rochester is playing a ""hard to get heartthrob routine"" on, and that Rochester neither expects nor intends to fall in love with Jane.

It's certainly the ultimate Gothic romance: bad decisions, guilty secrets, abuse of innocents, and forbidden love.","lsj1kqq"
