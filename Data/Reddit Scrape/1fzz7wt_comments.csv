"lr52cdg","imnotbovvered","2024-10-09 19:38:37 UTC","I would say he's very different. He's not the emotionally unavailable guy who's only nice to his girlfriend. That's the unrealistic fantasy that many romances sell us. 

The difference is this. *He changes*. He is humble and friendly to the Gardiners. By inviting them, he welcomes them into his acquaintance. Even though they are tradespeople and he is very rich landed gentry, he doesn't hold himself far above them. 

Before, he would have been aloof, maybe deciding that anybody he didn't already know wasn't worth giving his time to. And nobody had ever told him there was a problem with that. He was always told that he was good and proper. When Elizabeth challenged him, he actually stopped and reflected, and tried to improve himself. This is not a one time grand gesture. This is a concerted effort over time, to become a better person. And while he may not have given up hope for her, it seems that these changes are not for her benefit. He's not changing to get her, since he considers it unlikely she would change her mind. He wants to be a better person. 

And he *did* have good morals, even before she challenged him. He treated his servants very well. He took his responsibilities as part of the privileged class seriously. His main flaw was excessive pride. 

I also don't think there was constant conflict during the courtship.  During the time there was conflict, Elizabeth was completely oblivious to the fact that there *was* any courtship. She had no idea he liked her. She wasn't ""hate flirting"" as some people call it. She was being snarky because she didn't like him at all and wanted to privately laugh at him. Meanwhile he's equally oblivious thinking that she's being funny in a playful way, completely blind to the fact that she doesn't like him. So there was no real courtship in that period. They were two people completely unaware of the other's intentions. 

Post-proposal and explanation letter, we don't see conflict between them. What we see is two people trying to overcome the awkwardness of having suddenly shared so much of their feelings with each other. It's not a fiery burning courtship. It's a slow gentle learning to see each other and themselves in a new light. They're learning to be around each other and Elizabeth is learning that she appreciates it.

Edit: I don't think his interest was flattering because he was hard to get. She appreciated the fluttery of attention from a man of his  high status. But that would never change her feelings. Her feelings changed when she realized how she'd misjudged him, and was willing to see him in a different light.",""
"lr4yq63","Trintron","2024-10-09 19:19:18 UTC","Outside of being rude, we never see Darcy do something morally dubious or bad.



It's not like he kept a previous wife in the attic. 


He lacks social skills and comes across as proud because of his social status.


Emotional availability also is culturally dependant. In P&Ps cultural context men were expected to be affable even if it meant hiding ones own feelings - we see this in Bingly. Darcy on the other hand doesn't hide his emotions and is a bit more brooding in a Romantic sense. 


So in a way, he is more emotionally available because he is more transparent in his emotions. Contrasted with what a current era woman would consider emotionally available, I can see the argument he is not.



This is also an era where men and women didn't interact in ways prior to marriage where there would be a chance for deep emotional intimacy.

"lr505fy","ds3272","2024-10-09 19:26:51 UTC","I don't think so.

Elizabeth and Darcy *both*, and in equal measure, have to reflect and mature in order to reach the ending. The Jennifer Ehle & Colin Firth BBC version of the story presents *him* as the character who changes, and I think that's a common interpretation, but I think Elizabeth has to *get over herself*, too.

I think it's the story of two young people who both find themselves maturing into an unlikely, well-suited pair. 

I also think that the symmetry is the central feature of the story. If we were to reduce Darcy's development to something simplistic and focused just on him, then (as I see it) you've imbalanced the delicate, defining feature of the book.",""

He steps up after she destroyed him verbally and tries to become the best form of himself and does not expect anything to come if it

He listens to Lizzy that Jane liked bingley a lot and sets them back up together because he realises he was wrong

By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.'

"lr5bzmg","10Panoptica","2024-10-09 20:29:12 UTC","I don't see how. He's not emotionally unavailable. He might seem reserved by 21st century standards, but that was considered proper at the time. His minor rudeness in the beginning exists so Elizabeth has cause to dislike and refuse him.

The real fantasy is that someone who's the whole package - intelligent, virtuous, handsome, and rich - will fall for an ordinary, relatable woman, because that will solve all her problems. But the refusal is also part of the fantasy. It protects her from having to be shallow or mercenary. Initially refusing him lets her be noble, and ruled by integrity. She gets to have her cake & eat it too.

But also... I would not charactererize the story as a conflicted courtship (they're not courting) or full of sexual tension (in the movies, sure, but the book?). And I would say a major point of the later revelations is establishing their compatibility.

*Edit: I do agree that Darcy changes, but mostly in regards to his pride and how he sees his ""social inferiors."" I don't think he was ever emotionally unavailable. What we know of his close relationship with his sister, his friendship with Bingley, and Wickham's comment that he can be agreeable among those he considers equal, really suggest that he was always emotionally open among those he was actually intimate with. He just didn't perform friendliness for casual acquaintances and strangers.*",""
"lr53m75","Necromelody","2024-10-09 19:45:18 UTC","I think everyone also tends forget that, in addition to being somewhat awkward in social situations, we are also catching Darcy at kind of a *bad time*. He just had his sister almost elope with a guy he's known his whole life, using a nanny he also knew for a long time and *trusted*.

Remember that everyone who knows Darcy talks very well about him and how affable, if a bit stiff, he is.

His party including Bingly don't know the particulars of what happened with Wikham, but seem to at least know that Darcy is in somewhat of a funk and really NOT in the mood to try in a social setting.

He changes his attitude for Elizabeth but it's not like he is reinventing himself. He was always a good but awkward guy who played his hands too close to his heart and was judged extremely harshly because of circumstances, and because Wikham spends months shit talking him to everyone who would listen.",""
"lr4zxxa","space-cyborg","2024-10-09 19:25:46 UTC","It’s an interesting take. 

I don’t think he is emotionally unavailable. He’s deep. He doesn’t give affection easily. He claims that once his good opinion of someone is lost, it’s lost forever, but I think the opposite is also true: when he loves someone, he commits to it 100%. He’s there for his sister and his friends, even when they act in ways he doesn’t approve of. 

I think he was actually quite honest, if not tactful, when he said he was willing to overlook her horrifying family because of how much he cared about her. She loves him even though he’s socially awkward, not tactful, and will undoubtedly embarrass her on a million ways over the next 50 years. (Kind of like Prince Phillip!)

The only reason the relationship ends up happening is they both *realize* the perceived insults occurred because they fucked up in the first place. They both do self-work and accept responsibility for their own mistakes. Which shows growth on both sides.

And then their pride and prejudice were *in defense of* people they cared about, so it's probably more likely to cause problems for them as a couple facing others, rather than with each other.

Jane Austin evidently liked pairing characters that fit well, while also showing flaws in various personality types. I remember liking that about *Sense and Sensibility*, too, though that one admittedly has a bit more semantic change to account for.",""

"lr6ep7a","ReaperReader","2024-10-10 00:17:29 UTC","A) Mr Darcy is English, and upper-class English, I don't know what cultural background you have, but ""emotionally unavailable"" is the cultural standard until people are very close. As someone who has read a lot of British literature, Darcy comes across to me as someone who is expressing a lot of emotion, just expressing it in a reserved way.

B) Elizabeth is oblivious to his growing interest in her until he proposes for the first time, at which point she's flattered but rejects him. When she meets him again, so far from being hard to get, he's exerting himself to please her, and that's when she starts to fall in love with him. 

C) I wouldn't say Darcy is more reserved and controlled than Elizabeth, or less outspoken. At Netherfield, he reveals a fair bit about himself in conversation and he even teases her and Caroline on one occasion. Conversely Elizabeth controls herself and conceals her emotions on many points, except with her sister Jane.  

D) I don't see Darcy as being controlling, his housekeeper says she's never had a cross word from him and she's known him since he was four years old.

I think an important point here is the cultural context. When two people are in love with each other, and know their feelings are returned, they frequently feel strong urges to engage in activity that has been known to result in babies. In a society without DNA testing, marriage was the best way of holding a man financially liable for said babies, and in a society without reliable contraceptives, the woman's family would want the wedding to take place sooner rather than later. So for a young man to express romantic interest in a young lady was a big deal, an open expression of affection was basically a marriage proposal, if the man had any sense of honour. And if it was accepted, he was then engaged and an honourable man would never break an engagement, though a lady could. (I presume the cultural assumption there was that a lady would only break an engagement if she knew she couldn't possibly be pregnant). So for Darcy, declaring his feelings was a high-stakes decision.",""

"lr57u08","intrepidcaribou","2024-10-09 20:07:16 UTC","Disagreeing with some folks here, that Darcy does have a certain amount of ""emotional unavailability"" or ""emotionally avoidant"" tendencies. Even in those days, if you had a crush on a girl you weren't supposed to hold it in until it exploded out into a disastrous marriage proposal. It shows he's disconnected from his emotions to a significant degree. I think this is a combination of his upbringing, his naturally shy nature, and the fact that he took on the massive responsibility for his estate and sister at a very young age, and puts pressure on himself to be ""correct"" in everything he does.

I think it's something he's always going to struggle with. But the fact that he works on building and repairing his relationships with Georgianna and Bingley as much as he does shows being connected to his emotions is important to him - because they are people who are both deeply connected to their emotions. He feels a certain amount of shame about ""feeling"" because he doesn't give himself permission to feel the way he needs to to feel whole.

His whole relationship with Elizabeth in the first half of the book is based entirely on a fantasy in his head. This is called limerence and it's very dangerous - because it inevitably causes pain. And it's super-common for people like Darcy who have disavowed their feelings. I think we tell ourselves that it's romantic, but in reality it's self-destructive and if you were Mr Darcy experiencing this in 2024, it wouldn't feel charming - it would feel like hell.

He tells himself it's a socially inappropriate match because he doesn't want to actually deal with his feelings. But in the end, it's not like anyone else has any problem with the marriage except Lady Catherine. It's mostly just Darcy not being about to deal with ""love"" feelings. I think Darcy would have struggled if the woman in question was on par with him socially. It's a him problem more than an Elizabeth problem.

I do honestly feel that the two are temperamentally well-suited but they'll need to go through a ton of work to make their marriage work. Mostly because Darcy tends to shut down and get defensive in the face of strong emotions and Elizabeth tends to get worked up.",""

I read a blog post years ago which explains that most authors who attempt to write a ""Mr. Darcy"" misunderstand fundamental things about what make Mr. Darcy compelling. It's not that he's a jerk or aloof; it is that he is complex/more than meets the eye and has that heart of gold you mention. The difference between what is first seen and what really is makes him an interesting puzzle, rather than flat and quickly solved as a brain teaser. The fact that he seems so arrogant, but actually corrects his errors once he is made aware of them (AND does so without advertising that he is doing so), indicate that he is truly a good man. 

Yes, he makes those corrections once he's taken an interest in Elizabeth but he \\*does not know\\* he was in error until she provides context/information. We don't know whether he would fail to correct his mistakes if he had learned he was wrong via some other vector, though the story to me implies that he is the sort of person who would.

I agree that in reality, most people are just self-interested jerks. He's romantic because he's better than most; that's what makes him a catch and worthy of being a book character.

In blunt terms: Women find confident and capable men attractive (in the picture if not in the lime light) at the same time as such men felt to be insensitive and offensive if they don’t demonstrate equal social skills and even to the point of feeling derogatory to such men. Obviously social skills can be either demonstration of a more complete man and suitable suitor, deceptive or misleading and this is a big part of the game of courtship between men and women. Imho the tongue in cheek in the book is the fact Mr. Darcey proves himself by supplication of his Pride in the presence of Elizabeth as well as her own revelation that she had indeed been misled, her Prejudice at his social intercourse, all ending in a suitable suitor also of significant means (the tongue in cheek feather in the story’s cap).

The point tho is that Pride and Prejudice is a novel that is not the trope itself, the novel itself is contained in a specific historical time where certain actions and way of showing yourself were vital so there was a different way to view someone in a social construct and also on how to pursue them romantically. 

Darcy had too much Prejudice because of the Pride of his family and the social expectations ( which in that historical time make sense ) meanwhile Elizabeth has also her own sense of Pride which I think is costantly challenged by society expactations and the prejudice she has to face because of her family but also the society expactations of how women should be.

I have only seen the movie not read the novel ( which I want to do ) but the reason why it works so well is specifically the historical setting which seem to overwhelm both Elizabeth ( who reacts fiercely to it ) and Darcy ( which instead suffers it internally).

But outside the historical setting Darcy himself was a good person, who tries to help Elizabeth's family without even trying to take credit for it and I believe only later it is reveled that he helped her.
They are characters who are struggling with a certain type of society who categorize people in certain role models for women and other for men but which at the same time create big social differiences based on whealth and since the male and women struggle against categorization are different, Elizabeth is one that has to be bold and fierce meanwhile Darcy is the one that has to develop and strive for kindness and abandoning the "" idea of power "" that he has not only because man but also because he is rich.

In that regard I think this is why the novel never aged but is in a way so fresh that it feels like it cane out yesterday as a social commentary on men and woman.

Probably the historical time setting is a much bigger protagonist than the two of them and that's why most other books which ""trope-ified"" this type of relationship tend to appear strictly toxic when you read them once you are an adult, because the historical setting is absent therefore it lacks the central reason why most of these character are forced to act in certain ways or are conflicted and also the male and woman categorization and escaping those ""boxes"" is non-present cause they are approaced surface level while also only serving the ""i am the only one who can save him idea"", meanwhile Darcy is actively trying to improve himself by himself once he met Elizabeth i think.",""

To me he seemed like a self-indulgent female fantasy of a guy who “changes” from emotionally unavailable and very rude to the nicer humbler more sensitive version women yearn for powerful men to secretly be under the layers of indifference. 

Or even better, he was secretly all that and was just “misunderstood”. His behaviour was shockingly unappealing to me.

So you've definitely got some people right there who like him simply because they relate to him in some way, on a subconcious level. Like, he's this unsociable guy who both struggles with and thrives in the kind of society they had back then. Well off, can do as he likes for the most part, can follow the taught social rules well enough, but struggles with the rest. He's awkward, but he's also free, and if you were to be with hum, he would provide that freedom to you as well. And he doesn't mind Elizabeth's oddness. He himself is odd. Yanno?
(I'm also neurodivergent and honestly agree that a lot of the characters, both good and bad, give off neurodivergent vibes.)

Then there's the whole, ""the character doesn't like anyone except for their love interest"" and ""enemies to lovers"" tropes, which are very popular. Being someone special to someone who doesn't care for most / Loving each other even after knowing each other's worst flaws. 

And lots of other points I'd get into if I could remember more details (my memory is terrible) but I've read the book and watched one of the movies a looot of times, since I really like the setting, plot, and different dynamics between characters.

His father was an established member of the gentry (upper middle class today) and if I remember right his mother was born to a minor aristocratic family (true upper class). He was raised to be his father's heir, so he would have been raised from boyhood to understand proper etiquette and social graces. 

Couple that with the knowledge that the Bennets were the first family in the area (highest ranked socially), and he's actually among the Nuveau Riche while in Merryton, which to him would look like little more than an affectation of the society he's used to.

Then add that as ""a single man with large fortune,"" he has to be on his guard against gold diggers looking solely to increase their social standing, which was exactly what Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Lucas were hoping for with their daughters. He has probably been fending off suitors and honey traps for most of his life. With that kind of attention, I can understand him being a bit standoffish.","lr4x3x0"

Yes, he follows up with the words ""admiration"" and ""love"", but given the social mores of the society he lives he clearly also means ""desire"".

I think he's an introverted loner who's just been born into a position where, for the most part, he's never been under any obligation to mask that he doesn't like people in the way that most people in that society have to at least try to.

Most people in that society have to at least put on a cheerful face and take a stab at being polite and cordial, whether they want to or not, because that's what's expected of them. But most rooms he walks into, Darcy's the highest-status guy there. He's totally capable of being polite when the situation calls for it, but somewhere like Meryton, he can be grumpy and aloof and everybody else just has to grin and bear it because he's too important a social connection to offend.

And then he proposes to Elizabeth, and he thinks there's no universe where she'd possibly say no, so he's (dickishly) honest about the fact that he likes her despite her being way below him socially and how much he thinks her family sucks, and he does all this completely convinced that she's going to say yes to him anyway because it's not like she could possibly do better.

That's a big part of why it throws him for such a loop when she not only rejects his proposal, but tells him in exhaustive detail why she's saying no and where he can shove that ring. Assuming it's even ever happened before, when do you figure the last time is that anybody talked to him like that?

Her mother is not aware of social propriety and embarrasses the family.


Her father married her mother because she was beautiful, and after marriage realized he disliked her as a person. That's not happening with Darcy and Elizabeth.



Darcy is awkward but does have some degree of social awareness. 


Elizabeth and him both share a sense of duty towards their families and want happiness in marriage for those close to them as well as themselves. 


I view the issues they face early in the book as fundamental communication mistakes. They don't know each other well enough to understand each other's points of view and so they misunderstand each other. That changes over the course of the book. 


I think shared values and the ability to interpret each other's actions in a positive light, which they achieve by the end of the book, suggests they might have a good marriage ahead of them.","lr53f74"

Perhaps Darcy's character flaws do come back to haunt them and ultimately break their marriage (or perhaps Lizzie's do, but this is less likely I imagine as she doesn't have the same social standing as him)-- or perhaps they do live no less happily ever after than the average happily married couple

But I think this is a point you can make about any reasonably well-developed literary couple who gets their happily ever after, as well as a large number of real couples as well.  To the extent that we can make that point better about Darcy than others, it's because Austen's a damn good character writer.","lr53f74"

The important thing to remember is the social context in which they met. Darcy has literally every reason in the world to think that the Bennet family was a group of crass social claimers attempting to honey pot his best friend. Because that was literally the motivation of a bunch of them. So he was rude, but he was rude because he thought he had every reason to dislike them, and is not the sort of person who plays games. He is socially awkward, and generally has low opinions of those who would play with other people's hearts for financial gain, for obvious reasons.

What we see is natural character growth with the characters. Darcy learns to explain himself better and to not rest on his pride, and Elizabeth learns to actually pay attention to him instead of prejudging his behavior on the basis of other wealthy land owners.

Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.

These are the words of somebody who sees his own flaws. In the beginning he only wanted to think well of his own circle. And he was willing to extend his circle to Lizzy. But now he's learning to see everybody in a different light. And I think his behaviour to the Gardiners is a good starting point.","lr58986"

He thinks it's clever and enjoyable. Then when Elizabeth is staying at Hunsford, she makes a point of telling Darcy her favorite places to walk, assuming he'll want to avoid her, and is surprised when he keeps turning up in those places afterwards.

That he couldn't exercise the same restraint was something that he judged himself for though he's definitely being an asshole here.

I actually think what we're meant to take away is that Mr Darcy is just as capable of violating propriety as the Bennets, and he demonstrates the very qualities he criticizes them for, as Lizzie rightly points out to him.

With himself, he feels like he can see the situation clearly, knows it's bad, and decides to do it anyway because he wants her. He basically says as much on his proposal- he thinks her family sucks and her social position is unfortunate but he's willing to marry her anyway because he's in love with her even though he wishes he weren't. He isn't under any delusions like poor Bingley, he hasn't been played by money grubbing Lizzie and her family the way Bingley has. He says this (in slightly nicer words but not THAT much nicer) and then is surprised when she rejects him. It did not occur to him that she would refuse since he sees himself as clearly out of her league and assumed she'd accept such a stroke of luck as his proposal.

"lr5cc2r","Neptunie","2024-10-09 20:31:01 UTC","Potentially because Darcy’s own views towards marriage is partially based off his own social class. Marriage isn’t about love, but a business transaction. Though that is the interesting juxtaposition, that by all means based off those criteria Elizabeth is not a suitable choice other than she’s a gentleman’s daughter.

But regardless of Elizabeth not meeting most of the socially acceptable criteria of what a man of his status looks for in a wife, him proposing to Elizabeth is a way for Austen to display his Pride. That even though we as the reader and even most other characters can see her indifference, he knows he’s a most eligible catch of the season so why should she refuse?

This is also just me speculating, but I do truly think that Darcy was never looking for a love match for himself after his years of being part of the season so that’s why the “logic” doesn’t apply to himself.
It seems he just didn’t want someone disingenuous, having similar values of his own, & being educated enough to hold a conversation, etc. all while being in his own social circle (though we saw how that worked out.)","lr56z94"

In comparison to her he is a lot more socially awkward mixed in with being an introvert. When they are together at Rosings - when he actually _wanted_ to be courting her - he rarely even spoke to her even then. He went to the Parsonage _several_ times only to not speak to her. When he seeks her out on her walks, he also remains quieter and Elizabeth thinks in her POV how odd the silences are. 

Earlier on at Netherfield, he specifically seeks her out to dance only to not speak when dancing. Most pointedly he asks if it is a habit of hers to talk whilst dancing, and then asks her if she likes books (which Elizabeth remarks of the point of discussing books in a ballroom).","lr83vot"

A big clue in Darcy going against this is hardly interacting with Elizabeth, but in his mind he was actually courting her and she loved him as much as he 'ardently' loved her. If he was able to communicate more with her, and was more socially adept he would have recognised her behaviour towards him was not that favourable. 

Regency etiquette has very rigid rules for courtship and romantic relationships in general, and Darcy was very clueless the whole time until he made that disastrous first Proposal.

I don't think his pride and introverted social awkwardness need to go hand in hand. It could be entirely possible he was both, he even admits to both at different parts of the book.","lr5ouxy"

Even if she'd never agreed to marry him, the attitude shift would have stuck. For most of the time they interact after that failed proposal, he's pretty much convinced that she'd rather saw off an arm than marry him and that being with her isn't an option for him.

The nice things he does for her don't come with strings attached. In fact, he doesn't even want her to *know* that he bailed her sister out because he doesn't want her to think he's trying to buy her off or something.

He did not pull any plots or anything as far as I can remember. He literally just gave his opinion, and Bingley trusted him.

And remember: her family *was* horrible. They were all enamoured with the guy who seduced and almost ruined his sister so he could get access to Darcy's money. And they were committing every social faux pas imaginable, and were a massive liability in their society.

Elizabeth being not awful is what made him look past all that, but it does not mean his judgement was without foundation. And he did not in any way attempt to trick Elizabeth into courting him by removing his objection, or even by saving her sister. He did not even tell her he did those things, she had to find out on her own, and only managed it because other people broke confidentiality. 

He seemingly had zero expectation that it would change her mind, he just deeply respected her and did not want to see her family ruined over the same cretin who had hurt his sister.

He just realized how standoffish and cruel he appeared to be based on her refusal, and did his best to remedy things he felt personally responsible for. (Not warning them about the Wickam, accidentally ruining a good thing for his friend.)

Darcy isn't being controlling or manipulative. He's just haughty and snobbish and rude. He and Lizzie both see themselves as being superior to social etiquette but the truth is they are both playing the game as much as anyone, how could they not? But we see that he's an honorable and moral person who is capable of real intimacy and kindness.

Forster might be old money, but the officers under his command are militia, which means none of them were actually from Merryton, as militia units were never posted in their home counties, and Forster plainly states they're boys playing at military. Maybe some come from old families, but the prestige lies with the Regulars, not the militia. And the Bingleys are outright named as Nuveau Riche.

Darcy ignores the rules repeatedly in regard to those he feels do not deserve his efforts. 

Darcy is a hypocrite because he judges others who do not follow the rules of etiquette, but he feels himself above following the rules of etiquette outside of his existing family circle and within his estate work.

Elizabeth's teasing impertinance comes off as flirting. She seems to be encouraging him to join her on walks (a common courting activity in the country) when she says that she walks that way most days, she jokes with him and is so sweet in her manner that her remarks lose their sing and seem to invite a teasing iimacy.

Half of those times, he ""sat without even opening his lips"" as paraphrased from Elizabeth's POV in the book. They walked but they rarely spoke, and she said the silences often became uncomfortable. Darcy was unable to detect this though, and totally believed they were courting and she was also as eager as him. On his final day at Rosings, he was actually delusional enough to believe she wanted his presence and his proposal _(when the reported story from Mr and Mrs Collins was that she couldn't attend dinner because she had a headache. So why did he still go?)_","lr66hq0"

"lr5yskf","Caelinus","2024-10-09 22:38:00 UTC","It is interesting. I have thought about the title a lot over the years as I think it is one of the best titles for a work of fiction I have ever read. There are just so many layers in how those themes integrate into the characters and their society, and centering it really brings out the criticism that is being directed at that society and characters. 

I think that my initial understanding of the story was hampered by someone telling me that Darcy was ""Pride"" and Elizabeth was ""Prejudice"" and so I attempted to interpret it in that lens, but it never really sat well with me. Looking at it as commentary on both lead characters, and more so their whole culture, adds so much depth to the interpretation. Their society is basically defined by its pride and its prejudice, and Darcy and Elizabeth growing and learning to look past those traits and what is ""acceptable"" is what got them to happiness.

It is just a fascinating book. Makes sense it has survived as long as it has.","lr5s33p"
"lr5xjkg","Caelinus","2024-10-09 22:30:07 UTC","The difference is that he thought that Jane and Elizabeth were the same until he got to know them. He had no reason to trust Jane until he came to trust Elizabeth. He did not know her, and could only see a really pretty woman from an inappropriate family with a wealth obsessed mother making eyes at his friend. He also interpreted her shyness as disinterest, which led him to believe she was indifferent, and was only attempting to make a good match for herself.

But he was wrong, and Elizabeth's statements during her refusal made him aware that he had misinterpreted the events. He was not wrong about the family, but he was wrong about Jane. Unless I am getting the order of events really messed up, he withdrew his objection before Elizabeth started to change her mind about him, and he did so without any expectation of her changing her mind. 

Learning to change his mind was part of his character development in overcoming his pride. He ""Once my good opinion is lost, it is lost forever"" line was what he developed away from. So he was absolutely incorrect in what he believed, and he was wrong to not look into it deeper, but that is the core of his character development.

So yeah, ego was part of the problem. It is the ""Pride"" in Pride and Prejudice. I am not of the opinion that Darcy is Pride and Elizabeth is prejudice though, they both had to overcome their pride and prejudice. In Elizabeth's case she basically did the exact same thing he did to Darcy, assuming the absolute worst about him until she got more information that made he reevaluate her opinion.","lr5qxaf"
"lr6e59p","Katerade44","2024-10-10 00:14:01 UTC","Oh, Darcy was clueless as to how he came off because his opinion of himself was so high. That doesn't make him shy or unable to socialize. That makes him overconfident, arrogant, and entitled.

None of that changes that Elizabeth came off as flirty and encouraging or makes him not purposefully rude. 

ETA: He went because he was selfish and didn't, even once, consider Elizabeth's feelings about anything except himself.","lr69a16"

"lr6foal","lovelylonelyphantom","2024-10-10 00:23:31 UTC","The book supports that Darcy is an introvert and shy, the way he describes himself is textbook introvertedness 

> **I certainly have not the talent which some people possess, of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.**

I never said he _wasn't_ also proud, selfish, entitled and all the other things you stated. I said he can be all these things; a person can be both prideful and introverted just as Darcy's character also displays both. He also later acknowledges his pride at the end of the book, so that was never denied.

**ETA:** Elizabeth had also been deliberately provoking (especially in some conversations during his stay at Netherfield) and he didn't pick up on that at any point. Again, even during her stay at Hunsford they rarely spoke to each other. Even for regency standards walking with someone 3 times is not indicative of further feelings. Austen has written other books where it's the opposite.","lr6e59p"
"lr6gah4","Katerade44","2024-10-10 00:27:21 UTC","He doesn't appear interested because he doesn't try, not because he can't. Again, this is stared by his friend and cousin stating that he is friendly and lively in other society. Darcy even states that he never exerted himself to do so prior to Elizabeth's telling him off due to his pride and conceit.

This is proven by him being successful when he puts forth a bit of effort with the Gardiners when they meet at Pemberly. He is polite and interested. It just took him actually trying instead of writing them off like he did people in Meryton.","lr6foal"
"lr6hrxl","lovelylonelyphantom","2024-10-10 00:36:35 UTC","I edited to add to my last comment further

but R.e; the shyness, that doesn't go away just because you practice and put yourself out there more. People who are introverts _remain_ introverts even if you make yourself converse with strangers more. Socialising comes naturally to Elizabeth, but it does not to Darcy. He says he cannot catch their tone of conversation or join easily like he observes other people doing, and that's not something you overcome by simply removing pride. They don't go hand in hand like you're implying.","lr6gah4"
"lr6j0zr","Katerade44","2024-10-10 00:44:20 UTC","Introversion and shyness are two separate things, but that's another issue.

I agree that shyness doesn't just go away. Thus, the fact that both Bingley and Col. Fitzwilliam state that Mr. Darcy is easily social in other places, that Darcy makes a very quick turn around when he merely tries, and that Darcy himself says that he was capable of better but simply didn't try for those outside of his circle all point to him *not being shy.* 

He wasn't shy. He was a deliberately rude snob to those outside of his circle.

ETA: Not being able to *easily* fake interest in new people is not the same as being shy at all.","lr6hrxl"
"lr6lxn8","lovelylonelyphantom","2024-10-10 01:02:44 UTC","> is easily social in other places, that Darcy makes a very quick turn around when he merely tries,

Like most introverts also are, as it's easy to socialise in your own circle Vs unfamiliar people or complete strangers. Darcy would have behaved more differently with Georgiana, Bingley, Col Fitzwilliam compared to with strangers for example. Once he improved from his pride, he also managed to converse with the Gardiners well enough within the familiarity of his own home. 

But as you said, maybe it is also introvertedness Vs shyness. An introvert prefers solitude outside their comfort zone, shy people experience further nervousness/anxiety and so on. We don't have description that deep in his character to say which, but I have always had the impression he prefers to remain to himself most the time therefore is an introvert. Even for a woman he likes, he more often remains quieter than preferring to converse with her; that's not out of pride as that was only direcred towards her family and class.","lr6j0zr"
"lr6m6ki","Katerade44","2024-10-10 01:04:21 UTC","Being awkward socially and being shy are two different things. Being an introvert and being shy are two different things. Being quiet and being shy are two different things.

Darcy was socially awkward and quiet by nature, no doubt. He was never shy, and nothing in the text supports him being shy. He is BRAZEN in his awkwardness and easily stops being awkward simply by trying.","lr6lxn8"
