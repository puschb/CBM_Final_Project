"lsob120","SillyMattFace","2024-10-19 12:17:47 UTC","I’ve only encountered a handful of books, and indeed pieces of media in general, that overtly include the pandemic, and I think most things will politely ignore it moving forward.

We had the same thing after the 1918 flu pandemic. It killed a monstrous 50 million people, more than WWI. But there are very few pieces of literature from the time that acknowledge it.

My reaction the few times I have encountered Covid in books has been a disgruntled ‘ugh’ and a vague feeling of unease. It was a difficult, unpleasant time while the specifics were quite inane and boring. No one is keen to relive it.",""

"lsod6jh","magnetrose","2024-10-19 12:34:32 UTC","I just recently read The Great Influenza about the 1918 flu pandemic and one of the things he mentioned in it was that there was very few first hand accounts in fiction. One of the few was Pale Horse Pale Rider.  


I think it genuinely might be one of those things that's hard to stomach or fictionalize when you have already lived through it because its relentless and neverending. There's no big bad to defeat, no climactic story. To be perfectly honest with you I haven't bothered to read anything set around covid, or even 9/11 which I also lived through. 


 But I think those stories are important to tell because 100 years from now maybe a few of those will survive in pop culture to remind us once again what surviving a years long pandemic can be like. And also, that humanity is so very fragile sometimes, which isn't what most people want to read.    


Edit to add: Zombie fiction is just a vehicle for disease fears but it anthopomorphizes disease which is a more palpable enemy to defeat than something you cannot see. Can't pull a gun on Covid but you can on your stupid neighbor who let himself get bit. ",""

That being said, COVID actually took away from our real life story. It was inconvenient, isolating, tedious, scary, divisive, and an over all shitty thing that happened.

I have only read Holly and I think one other King book where it is a plot point, and I do agree, King harps on it more than he should, but on reflection, it feels sort of like COVID felt in real life. All those things I mentioned above came out in that story because of his overly talking about it in the story. I think the overall story would have been better if it hadn't been included, but given Hollys character, it made sense she would be obsessed with it. In that way I think it mirrored COVID in real life. Some people were obsessed with it. COVID itself was very annoying, and it affected almost everything we did negatively.",""

Edited to add: this was a major thing i lived through and, as someone who didn't get the shared experience of staying home but rather having to work and be at increased risk because of constant exposure, I have largely felt invisible by the prevailing narrative about how ""we"" got through covid. ""We all stayed home,"" ""we were all on lockdown,"" etc. My spouse and I were still out there every day suffering thru the anxiety of knowing we might die soon.

It affected the characters' lives, just as it affected ours, but I didn't want to dwell on it.


One of my YA books ended at a very specific event in 2019, and I've actually had to take the decision not to write the third book in the trilogy becuase I couldn't see a way of avoiding making the pandemic a big plot point. My editor suggested we pretend it didn't happen, but that would take away from the realism.  Can't skip ahead in time as the MC would no longer be the right age for the target reader.

I recently finished (within the past year at least) The Paleontologist by Luke Dumas and that used COVID quite well, I thought. The premise there is that a museum is shut down and failing due to the temporary shut down. And its a thriller so that atmosphere really helps make the novel hit. The isolation of the main character (who had moved either just before/during the pandemic) is also heightened due to the fact that the world is kinda shut down.

"lsochca","Hookton","2024-10-19 12:29:09 UTC","Do you mean you incorporated the pandemic/lockdowns into your story? That's what I'm talking about.

But if that is what you mean, it's a fair point. The ones I mentioned were Holly by Stephen King (obviously a powerhouse but even a lot of his fans recognise his weaknesses), Apples Never Fall by Liane Moriarty (which is... Decent quality chicklit/family drama/mystery) and Maureen Fry by Rachel Joyce (which was part of a series of companion novels I loved the first of, but ended up being underwhelmed by the third of).

In all of them I thought they were at least decently written and enjoyable, and they've all done reasonably well commercially afaik—but as soon as I got to page 400 and a COVID plotline was shoehorned in, I was rolling my eyes. 

I'm at the point that I do not want to hear about COVID any more and no, Maureen, I don't want your musings on it.","lsoa37n"

Is this just because it was in the recent past and/or because you experienced it yourself?

Surely nobody would ever say that setting a novel during the Council of Chalcedon or the Long March dated it in a negative way.","lso92wu"
"lsoegva","justahominid","2024-10-19 12:44:15 UTC","I think it’s going to vary from person to person. And these thoughts are broader than just books and include other media. 

Objectively, media being set around current or active hardships is not new, nor is it necessarily a bad thing. See, for example, *The Grapes of Wrath* which was published during (or shortly after, I imagine the boundary was fuzzy, particularly at the time) the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. But it’s one of the greatest American novels of all time. 

That said, I do think that stories set during such events are going to hit very differently—and not necessarily in a good way—for people who lived through and experienced them. For example, I don’t remember the Cold War era (I was young when it ended), but for me it’s stories where 9/11 plays a heavy role. I was a high school senior when it happened and it was a huge moment in my life, even if I wasn’t directly impacted by it. Major movies started coming out a few years after, and it really rubbed me the wrong way. 

That said, I think that whether the use of such events is good or bad will ultimately be based on the quality of the underlying work more than the presence or absence of the event. I don’t know anything about the books you’ve read, but it could be that a mediocre to modestly good book just isn’t enough to separate you from the personal, emotional connection you have to it while a great work may win you over. For example, while the presence of 9/11 is generally a negative for me, even where the work is objectively good (e.g., *Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close*), I’m a big musicals fan and *Come From Away* is so good that it made it into my top 5 shows.","lsoak0v"

I recommended the movie to a friend and she was OUTRAGED that “those people would be used as fodder for fiction”. She thought it was ghastly to “use” the event in fiction, and that it should only be mentioned in history books and serious documentaries. We were about 10 when it happened, for what it’s worth. 

I think some people do see traumatic events they’ve lived through as for the history books ONLY, because they’re so connected to the trauma that it can feel like a personal disrespect to see someone benefitting from it as a means to generate creative work.","lso9u41"
"lsodrxl","Smooth-Review-2614","2024-10-19 12:39:07 UTC","You have to remember that Covid is the rare event that hit every where.

You ask me about 9/11 and my thoughts go to the Pentagon. 

The lionization of first responders still feels off to me.  The large public displays of gratitude to military and first responders in New York towns still feels wrong.  

Covid hit areas by population density and by occupation. It got political from the jump and not even a 20 year cool down is going to change that.  This is an event whose memory is going to be a mosaic instead of a clean main story. 

I have a strong feeling Covid is going to get memory holed like the 1919 flu pandemic.","lso9u41"
