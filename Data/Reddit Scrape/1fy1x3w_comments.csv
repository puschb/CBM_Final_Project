Every book has some effect on you, and even if it doesn't leave a lasting effect, you can treat it like a rung of a ladder that helped you get to the next one.

"lqqx32s","RighteousSelfBurner","2024-10-07 08:12:08 UTC","I personally think the article focuses a bit too much on technology and not enough on how memory works in general. I'm not confident enough in the science to say with much accuracy but repetition and emotional investment matter for long time memory. If you reread the books, discuss them with other people or they evoked large emotional response you are more likely to remember them longer.

If you are an avid reader then it's literally impossible to remember everything without perfect memory. The fact we can and do access a lot more works than in the past also plays a role in it. When I was young the selection was local library and book shops. Now it's practically entire world so the pace at which one can enjoy different works in various media is also different.",""
"lqrld28","Due-Scheme-6532","2024-10-07 12:19:30 UTC","For me, reading is about how I feel *while* reading. Nearly everything in life is fleeting. We habituate quickly. We seek the next novel thing, thought, or emotion. 

It takes a special book to stick with me, and that‚Äôs exactly how it is supposed to be. Why would I need or want to carry around the memories and feelings of another popcorn thriller or the 13th book in a fantasy series?

That serves no purpose and would simply clutter my mind. 

However, if a book *moves* you or changes your perspective on something, thats powerful. And that experience will be unique to each person. 

Thats what makes some books more special and memorable than others.",""

Books I read for school and discussed in class, books I wrote essays about, books I read with my book club ... obviously, information is better retained or more readily available when you don't just consume it and store it away but engage with it in some way. It's the same in language learning for example. You need to repeat your new words throughout multiple lessons and actively use them to remember them. 

Also, do we really forget or is the information just ""buried""? Because the reason why I rarely re-read thrillers, mysteries and similar genres is, that I THINK I have forgotten the plot, reading the blurb doesn't ring a bell. However, I start to remember things when I read the actual book - and with thrillers, this often means that I know way too early who did it.

The frustration you feel is quite common, and the article points out some of the main reasons why we might forget what we've read, but let's dive a little deeper. When you're younger, your experiences are often more novel, so your brain might be more inclined to remember them vividly. As we age, the volume of information we take in increases, causing us to filter what actually sticks.

Rather than bemoaning our minds' tendency to forget, let's embrace it! Think of it this way: each time you re-discover a book, it can feel like reading it for the first time because your perceptions and interpretations evolve right alongside you. Your journal's not just a tool‚Äîit's your time machine, giving you access to past insights while allowing the luxury of new ones.

Also, your findings are spot on. Reading physical books does engage different parts of the brain than digital, which may contribute to stronger memories. Changing environments and creating specific reading rituals can also ground your memory and situate stories in a kind of mental landmark.

I'm into words, so maybe that helps. I'm aphantasiac which might be contributory except I know neurotypical (or at least phantasiac) people who have a memory for words better than mine.

My sister, for example, is phantasiac but while it takes me five or six repetitions on a script to get it around 80% right right she's usually at the 80% mark after her second readthrough. Which really helped her when she was taking her anatomy and physiology class.

But I remember the actual books I've read and at least certain lines that I liked after just one reading.

I can't tell you what book I was reading a month ago without checking a journal, my memory for dates and absolute times is absolute shit. But I remember relative time (I read a Tree Grows in Brooklyn before I read Lord of the Rings) pretty well. And if you just ask me if I've read a given book, I can tell you and remember the plot, cool lines, etc.

If it helps any I am as fascinated and baffled by people's ability to visualize things as you are by an ability to remember books and words. I was 45 before I realized that people actually truly could visualize and all that talk about visualizing wasn't just metaphor.

I'd say the only downside is adoption, considering there are ton more reviews on Goodreads than Storygraph. But, I only use Storygraph for the nerd in me that needs data tracking when I read so its not that big of a deal to me. Plus, my TBR is like 1,000 books so idgaf on the ratings I am just trying to get through it haha","lqstjlm"
