When I read Nightbitch I was a mother with a similarly aged child as the protagonist, living in a town far from my family with no real friends to speak of. It felt incredible to relate to a character who was acting on the frustrations in such a completely insane, unselfconscious way. 


Also Ottessa Moshfegh's My Year of Rest and Relaxation really spoke to a younger version of me who probably would have absolutely loved to have drugged myself into a stupor. ",""

I consider these 2 characters victims, not empowered in any sense of the word.  

i think though anna karenina may hew closer to what you're talking about. although it ended very badly for her, i think there were moments in the story when she was actually empowered by acting on her own initiative, and she was able to live life fully and fulfillingly, even if it was for just a short while.",""

The main character deals with debilitating chronic pain, and there’s a moment when she breaks down and points out how society is fine with hearing about a little bit of pain, but not too much. It’s like, “I don’t actually want to hear all your pain; I just wanted to empathize once and move on.” It’s also interesting how, for men, expressing pain through anger feels almost expected, while women are expected to show sadness or tears—but not too much, or they risk becoming “annoying.” The unhinged female character trope makes space for women to express their pain however they want—whether it’s anger, frustration, or grief—like real human beings.

Her lack of self awareness and her inability to take personal responsibility are so well crafted that readers find her to be the blameless victim of a bad seed.  

I would argue absolutely that Eva is a victim but for those of you who have read the book, ask yourself if Eva had left after coming back from Africa, would any of the eventual tragedies have taken place? They would not. That tells you who the real driver of the novel was.  

The way that Shriver managed to craft this perfect background of Eva’s childhood to explain her deference to her husband and her very real narcissism while hating the one person in her life that reflects her back to herself, it’s just a stunning example of how well crafted a novel can be. I’ve read it six times and I only become more impressed. 

I also really loved Death in Her Hands. At one point so early on I was taken out by what the protagonist is feeding her dog and I was annoyed thinking Moshfegh just didn’t know much about dogs herself…. Beyond brilliant groundwork. Beyond.

"ltjmuor","Lapras_Lass","2024-10-24 17:28:53 UTC","Before I read Iron Widow, I was a little jaded by ""feminist"" novels that all seemed to start with the MC going through a breakup or divorce, which acts as the springboard for her anger. I get that many women go through a ""fuck all men"" phase after being burned romantically, but to write a whole novel about it just sounds like a teenage revenge fantasy. It's like a female incel story. 

That, or the misogyny is so over-the-top that it's unbelievable for the setting. No nuance or subtlety at all. 

The MC of Iron Widow has all the reasons for what she does. She has been horribly wronged, and it's done in a way that makes sense for the setting. There were some moments that felt a bit played up or forced, but it was grounded so well that I didn't really notice until my second read. I got very attached to her, and that's hard for me to do with female protagonists! I hope you enjoy reading it, too!","ltjhz46"
"ltkoxth","NoProperty_","2024-10-24 20:38:11 UTC","Hot take, but I'd skip it. Or at least see if you can get access to a few chapters before you buy it. It's very... juvenile.

But yes, she is definitely unhinged in her own way. Our admiration for women portrayed in this manner is probably due to their freshness. Mostly in old school literature, women are portrayed as some sort of saints. They are expected to be perfect and devout. Seeing women who are unapologetically human makes us relate to them. We are sick of 'Eves' and the 'Liliths' seem enchanting.","ltjaicu"

She also grows to hate some women too, those who have fully bought into the patriarchy and willing bow to a system that oppressed them.
