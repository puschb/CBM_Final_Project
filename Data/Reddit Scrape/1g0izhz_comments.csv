"lr9bux7","J_Horsley","2024-10-10 14:45:52 UTC","I think it's yet another manifestation of the extremely niche marketing and content creation that defines the current media landscape. Marketers and creators (often one and the same these days, it seems) have precise tools for selling us all exactly the kind of media we want based on our personal tastes. You can see it in your Netflix cue (""Darkly Comic Murder Mysteries Set in Cozy British Small Towns"") and in your suggested Spotify playlists (""Chill Lofi Beats for Cleaning Your Kitchen""). The result is a fragmented media landscape where people are able to stay inside their own preferred genre silos without having much exposure to anything outside of them. As an aside, I notice this in my work as a high school teacher-- it's become increasingly difficult to reference any one particular movie/show/YouTube channel/TikTok that a majority of students have seen; there's just so much content and it's all super tailored to particular demographics.

Of course, genre literature has been around a good long while and the criticism that's always been leveled against it is that it's too cookie-cutter. Fantasy novels are a lot of fun, but many are just recycling stock tropes over and over, and the quality of prose isn't stellar in most cases, either. It's the same for mysteries, romances, thrillers, etc. I'd argue that this even applies to a lot of what we consider ""good literature."" How many books can people write about a person in their forties having an identity crisis or a family falling into disarray because of their dysfunctional personalities, y'know? It may be that there's a higher volume of cookie-cutter genre lit being produced now, or it may be that companies are just more precise at marketing it. I'd wager it's a bit of both.

The silver lining there might just be that more people are reading, though, and I'll take that. I'd much rather people be reading generic pop-lit than binge-watching the same three Netflix shows on repeat.",""

>Azuma proposes a mode of consumption to gain access to the ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù of elements that make up the work. Particularly among fans of manga, anime, and games, as well as novels featuring manga/anime characters, Azuma highlights a practice of breaking works down in terms of elements, which trigger *moe,* or an affective response. The elements are often aspects of character design, but they can also be patterned voices and stories. In general, rather than narrative, Azuma argues that what is important today is the database of elements, which can be mixed and remixed to create new works and trigger *moe.*

There are times when I want to read deep, character driven books, the kind that are hard to blurb or would sound like a boring read. *The Wind that Lays Waste* by Sleva Almada is a beautiful book, I loved it but if you were to ask me what it's about...  It's about a man who fixes another man's car...and then it rains... And, there are times when I want a quick, plot driven book, a trope dopamine, and I appreciate the trope marketing because I can find the exact combination of tropes I'm in the mood for. If want character development, I go for the books with the vague blurbs. If I want plot driven, I go for the tropey blurbs.

It's like being excited to go over to a friend's house for dinner because he's a really good cook (you don't know what you'll be eating, but you know it'll be delicious) vs going on DoorDash because you're really in the  mood for some Hunan chicken and a spicy tuna roll.","lr91coh"

Online, that's how you get your book to show up on shelves when you don't have physical bookshelves.  If it doesn't have adequate specific descriptors, it'll get buried under thousands of more popular or noteworthy titles.  People won't buy your book if they don't know it exists.","lr97b65"
