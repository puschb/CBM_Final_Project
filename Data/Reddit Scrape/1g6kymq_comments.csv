The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power.


The idea that someone might do something so horrible for this reason and actually mean it, is quite terrifying to me. There is an idea that there is good in every person, and maybe that is true. But whether it's malice or a psychological dysfunction gone horribly awry, the fact that some people actually act on a logic with this basis was a disheartening reminder put quite well in this book.

I would now urge you to read Julia, by Sandra Newman, it is basically 1984 but from Julia's perspective.

It fills in the plot holes in 1984 that you never realised were there and opens your eyes to the difference in attitude that BB has between the male and female party members.

1) 1984
2) Burmese Days
3) Coming up for Air
4) Keep the Aspidistra Flying
5) Homage to Catalonia
6) Down and Out in Paris and London
7) Animal Farm

I got to use the chance to ask others about the Appendix! I feel like people rarely mention this, and I sometimes wonder if readers skip it because of its name thinking it’s not part of book, but as far as I can tell it very much is.

The Appendix covers the Principles of Newspeak and its tone and references to Big Brother make it feel like Big Brother eventually fails. It felt similar to me like the epilogue of Handmaids Tale in which we are now far past this authoritarian regime looking backward.

In this way, I felt like 1984 sort of has a happy ending. Although it feels less clear than it does in Handmaids Tale.

Anyone have similar thoughts?

"lsjt4pi","mauricioszabo","2024-10-18 16:33:55 UTC","My interpretations after reading the book (and also HUGE spoilers of course):

Big Brother is both real when it's needed (as an image to control everybody) and not when it's not needed (because the power is in the hands of the people).

Turns out that power that's on the people's hand is used to keep Big Brother in power, controlling everything, and it doesn't matter if he exists or not. The rebellion is also at the same level of ""exists and it doesn't"". It exists because it gives people's hope for something better, and it does offer something better; it doesn't because nobody cares, for the most part, and the ones that care are both in the rebellion, and also working for the Party.

What I mean with ""offers something better is - Winston was a much more troubled man at the beginning, because of his defiant spirit; when his spirit was crushed, he becomes a troubled man _in our eyes_, but at the eyes of the Party, he's much better; Winston _believes_ that too, for he is able to relate to other's more, because he's now a puppet. From here on, Winston can rise to the ranks, becoming closer to Big Brother, so he can work even better for the Revolution, bringing new, troubled individuals to it, to crush their spirit as it was done with him... if we _wants to_, meaning, if _the Party_ wants him too so it can ""manipulate-ish"" him to do it.

I write ""manipulate-ish"" because if the Party wants to, Winston will do it willingly, for he is broken, hollow. He's like one with the party at the end of the book, a cog in the machine, so he will do whatever the Party wants, and that's how it's always been.

It then finally got me, that everything that I found ""ironic"" or ""gaslighting"" in the book was exactly as if was written at the book; when they said ""the ministry of peace is responsible for war"", it's because the whole book is doublethink... everything was in their right place, at the ending, every contradiction was explained _by not explaining any_.

While early 20th century regimes such as Stalinist USSR, Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy preferred to use the threat of direct violence and persecution in response to ""dissidence""later authoritarian regimes who had access to better technologies truly began to perfect the ""art"" of fear through constant surveillance. While this was used in dictatorships all over the world, from Albania to Spain and Portugal, the one secret police to truly perfect this were the Stasi. By the 1970s they had built a surveillance system so extensive that every DDR citizen lived in constant fear of being spied on, even though the Stasi didn't have the personal to constantly spy on everyone. That psychological manipulation was a key component of the DDR power structure. The Stasi didn't have to react to dissidence (as much), because people were scared of even thinking about it.

You see, what we need to be human, is stories. We tell ourselves and eachother stories all the time. There is no physical barrier that makes one grassy field ""France"" and another grassy field ""Spain"". There is no fundamental law that tells us who ""owns"" an object, or something as abstract as an idea or a music piece. Yet we all share the same story that tells us that these things matter. and thus, we make them matter.

But this requires double-think to work. We all understand that Politics is both a bunch of short sighted people working on their own career and people voting against their interest, and yet at the same time Politics is also a democratic ideal of government by the people for the people, self correcting and continuously evolving. BOTH of those things are true. 

Or how life is both this magical thing that makes the world interesting, and also a bunch of atoms moving in repeating patterns according to the laws of nature.

The *bad* part of 1984 is that it uses this double-think to make the people believe in *bad* things they know to be false, like Big Brother and Propaganda. But in a normal situation, we use double think to believe in things like Karma, Justice, Righteousness, The Law, etc. We *need* doublethink to be human. otherwise we're either naive or jaded.","lsl2a7d"
