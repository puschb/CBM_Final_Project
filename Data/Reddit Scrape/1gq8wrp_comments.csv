"lww5g2k","AstridBelmontWrites","2024-11-13 09:28:58 UTC","Katniss and her mother in the Hunger Games. Her mother suffered from debilitating depression that resulted in the parentification of Katniss at 11 years old. They have such a complex relationship; Katniss resents her for not being present, and her mother holds so much guilt that she continues to distance herself from Katniss and instead channel her parenting into Prim, Katniss’ younger sister. Their only bond is the well being of prim, and there’s this really raw element of “I can’t bridge the gap with you, but I can try to do better with her” that’s just heartbreaking. They never reconcile and once Prim dies, they never speak again. It’s really a fascinating dynamic and I haven’t seen it in another book (not saying it’s not used anywhere else, just that I haven’t personally read that yet) and it weighs heavily on me. 

There’s also this element that Katniss’ mom comes out of her depression only when Katniss assumes the traditionally masculine duties that her father fulfilled; breadwinner and hunter. She essentially became the patriarch of the family and filled the void left in her mother’s life while vacating the role she had as her daughter for the rest of their relationship",""
"lwx7er7","glue101fm","2024-11-13 14:38:08 UTC","For me personally, Little Women has a really heartwarming portrayal of mother - daughter bonds, as well as sibling relationships and tensions, and even their relationship with their father is also really interesting despite not being present that much. I like how Marmi is presented as being a pretty perfect mother, but she tells Jo that she wasn’t always that way, she used to be fiery and have a temper and had to really work on herself. 

I reread it after my mum passed, and I found it very soothing in my grief, partly because I knew it had been one of my mum’s favourites. But also because it was such a real portrayal of family dynamics and people and their imperfections, whilst still being wholesome. I think all of the characters besides Beth have very relatable flaws that make them complicated but not evil. It felt like a hug in a book, there is so much love in that family, but it is also is a frustrating read at times, just like real life families",""

"lwx6ua3","Inconsequentialish","2024-11-13 14:34:46 UTC","Denethor and his sons Boromir and Faramir in Lord of the Rings.

PLEASE ignore the tomato-squishing lunatic in the movie...

Anyway, in very few words overall, you get an amazing amount of complexity in their relationships. The part that's a bit uncommon and fascinating is understanding how their duties to Gondor warp their relationships, even though they genuinely love each other.

For example, Boromir is the oldest and the heir, so from childhood he's the one that gets the majority of Denethor's attention. It's not because Denethor is a bad parent; it's because as the ruler of Gondor, Denethor has a duty to pour everything he can into training and molding his successor. Faramir understood the need for this, and did not resent it.

Likewise, Denethor has a duty as a military commander to send his sons into great danger because they're the best Captains he has. He didn't send Faramir on a hopeless mission to Osgiliath hoping he'd get killed; he had to send the best forces he had, knowing they would be overwhelmed and would need to retreat, because they needed to slow down the enemy forces at this choke point where they crossed the river. 

Denethor was not a madman; he was a tower of strength, a masterful ruler and military commander who had to put his personal feelings aside entirely to give Gondor the best chances for survival. 

What brought Denethor to utter despair was being deceived by what Sauron chose to show him in the palantir. But even in this despair, he was not broken. Faramir's injury and seemingly assured death was the final straw that did break his mind.

Overall, it's a fascinating glimpse into a set of father-son-brother relationships that pit love against duty.",""

Some memorable ones however are Carrie + Margaret White from Stephen King's great debut. There are too many Margarets in the world nowadays who want the best for their children in terms of religion. Or at least, they *think* they're giving so! Mrs White cannot live with her own hypocrisy of falling for the 'sin of intercourse'. But tbf, Margaret only has Carrie as her entire world, which also explains why she fights to keep her daughter by her side, even as it drains Carrie. As much as the dynamic is toxic, it remains electrifying on *every* reread of mine.

In A Thousand Splendid Suns, Hakim and Laila's relationship, short-lived as it was in the story, was one of the few bright spots among a book filled with endless misery. He encouraged her to get educated in a patriarchal era and country, which defied norms for her own good. Meanwhile, Jalil and Mariam's was depicted as close in the first few pages although young Mariam knows she was never equal to her other siblings. In truth, it is super rocky due to Jalil's own irresponsibility and the stigma of Mariam being illegitimate. He only does the bare minimum by sending her supplies weekly and spares only one hour per week to spend with her. Jalil then kickstarts the rest of Mariam's troubles by marrying her off to a shoemaker due to 'pressure from his true wives'.>!Jalil only reappears once after her marriage and never more. Spoiler alert: they never reconnected! !<>!It ends with Laila discovering that Jalil finally expressed remorse of how he treated Mariam, ofc it was far too late! Was it so hard just to take her to see Pinocchio?!!<",""

"lwxsnfa","farseer4","2024-11-13 16:32:16 UTC","Another recommendation: Enemy Brothers by Constance Savery. Not a biological parent in this case, but a much older brother who takes on a parental role, in the absence of the biological parents.

My goodreads review:

This book tells the story of 12-year-old Max Eckermann, a German boy who is unwillingly taken to Britain in the middle of WWII, having been on a ship that a group of Norgewian resistance fighters take by force and use to escape. Max is a member of the Jungvolk and believes firmly in his country's propaganda, to the extent that his captors have mockingly nicknamed him Little Hitler.

The novel begins when he arrives in England, while the authorities are trying to figure out what to do with the young prisoner (sending him back in the middle of the war is not practical because the UK maintains no diplomatic ties with Germany and any ship runs the risk of being torpedoed). Before he can be placed with a German family until the end of the war, a young British airman, Dym Ingleford, sees him and is convinced that Max is actually his brother Anthony, who was kidnapped years before. He presents enough evidence to convince the British authorities to place Max with his family. This is a family, however, that Max neither remembers nor acknowledges as his own. Despite his hostility, the Inglefords, starting with Dym, hope that with patience and understanding they will be able to recover the boy that they consider their lost relative.

The book was published in 1943, when the outcome of the war was still unknown. It gives an interesting depiction of what life in Britain was like during the Blitz. It's well-written, with a lot of sensitivity and empathy for Max's emotional turmoil, caught between two very different families and two countries at war. It is a book that I read in one sitting because I needed to find out what would happen, and a book that caused an emotional response in me with its depiction of brotherly love, initially one-sided.

I would recommend it both to children and to adult readers. Frankly, I'm surprised it's not better-known. It deserves to be a classic.",""

I particularly liked the relationship between Lindo and her daughter Waverly. They are both strong personalities, who butt heads and struggle for dominance, but secretly suffer in their fears that the other does not like or understand them. Lindo has been through so much in her life that she finds it difficult to relate to her daughter's ""easy"" American upbringing, but she doesn't share enough of herself for Waverly to truly understand where she is coming from. She is genuinely proud of Waverly but shows it in ways that alienate her and make her feel like a trophy rather than a child. Waverly tries to assert herself but desperately craves her mother's approval, and is caught in that double bind for many years, both trying to impress her mother but resenting her and being afraid of her. Ultimately her talent for chess is tied to her relationship with her mother, and when she loses that sense of security, she can no longer play.

Ellen is a ""Great Lady"" in Scarlett's mind, being beautiful and cultured but hardworking and selfless, and she seamlessly goes around taking care of everyone and running the plantation while Gerald mostly just *thinks* he is the one managing things. Ellen also, unlike Scarlett, presents as a humble and unassuming person who does not want to be the centre of attention. Scarlett keeps saying to herself that one day, when everything is right, she intends to become a ""Great Lady"" like her mother... but not yet, because it sounds like an awful lot of hard work and not very much fun. She's right.

It says a lot that Scarlett, whose defining (positive) traits are her strength and independence, breaks down to Rhett during the Atlanta siege that she wants to go home to her mother. She arrives too late, of course, and it seems that it is actually Ellen's death that is the final straw that prompts the ""I'll never be hungry again"" speech. Watch her reaction also when the soldier attempts to steal her mother's earbobs - she will NOT have some random guy touching her mother's things.","lwxe2xm"

It could be clearly seen that most of the issues his mother has hamshackled him with prevented him from forming healthy relationships and exposed him to the dangers of addiction.

 I really liked how the author has tied in addiction and parental love and made them not something mutually exclusive. How it is impossible to promise her child that she will get better for him because it is not that easy and it puts him at the danger of thinking that if she doesn't get better it is because she doesn't love him enough

The scene is written in such a way as to make us want to laugh at Mrs Bennett along with him. But what does Mr Bennett care about his daughters and their future, nothing! He reads about world events in the newspaper and dismisses the future of his own family as silly women's business, and Austen wants us to side with him. Later on, Lydia's attempt to rebel against her family for love is similarly dismissed as silliness, and the author's favorite child Lizzie is also the favorite Child of the father. It feels like a kind of pick me attitude, celebrating the supposedly rational point of view of a man who doesn't have to worry over marriage, over those of most of the women in the novel who are too materialistic or too romantic and why can't they be like the one girl who does things right.","lwxiscs"

I read it many times in my teens and 20s and always liked him and hated Mrs. Bennett, but you couldn't miss that sting at the end when Lizzie realizes that even the dad she loved had not been on great behavior, and that might be an understatement. My own dad was a ton of fun and very charming and funny I loved him SO much as a kid, but he was a very irresponsible person (he made Mr. Bennett look like an amateur in that regard) and there have definitely been MANY times now that I'm a parent where I've looked back and thought ""what the \\*actual fuck\\* did he think he was doing?"" And it's also clear in hindsight that his dropping the ball put a lot of pressure and stress on other family members that negatively affected my relationships with them in various ways.

I honestly can't think of a single female author from anywhere near that period who didn't suffer from that to some degree, typically much worse than she did. Even Mary Wollstonecraft (whose works Austen apparently read and liked) had some views that would set modern feminists' hair on fire, although she was easily 100-200 years' ahead of her time on some ideas. But I can definitely understand finding sexist subtext grating and frustrating enough that Austen's books (and probably other books from the period) just aren't your jam.

They're not saying that since Katniss is the leader of the family, she's the patriarch. They're saying that by stepping into the role that her father occupied of hunting and providing for the family, she is effectively acting in the patriarchal role. 

Her mother is still the 'matriarchal' actor in the family - as suggested in prior comments - but she only acts when she has the 'patriarchal' actor to work against.

This is interesting as a concept, though, since the passive or absent parent is a common trope in a fair few Young/New Adult fantasy novels. Think Feyre's father in ACOTAR (which is firmly NOT a YA novel, but the connections are unarguable).","lww93od"

And Mary Shelley, for that matter. I think they were all feminists for their time though, very much including Austen. (And Hell, there are MODERN female authors with issues with internalized sexism way worse than any of them). But I also don't think there's anything wrong with it if Austen's particular brand of it rubs you the wrong way more than the others.","ly0jwkq"

And yes, crazy is all too commonly applied to women who dare to show a shred of emotion or stress. The fact the courts buy into at all is shocking. There's actually a really interesting  book by Helena Kennedy called Eve Was Shamed, which talks about  how the British legal system fails women, in part by casting them in specific roles based on these old stereotypes. Fascinating read.","lxky1c2"
