Raging Loop’s Summary:

*The feast has begun... Can you escape the village alive?
Immerse yourself in a thrilling psychological horror story taking place in the secluded Japanese village of Yasumizu. A heavy mist surrounds the place, preventing everyone from ever leaving. Ancient gods have come back to hunt the villagers down one by one. The feast has begun, can you escape the village alive?*

A tribute to Japanese folklore:
*Haruaki Fusaishi is a young man freshly arrived to Yasumizu, a remote settlement in a mountainous region of Japan. He will become involved in an ominous local tradition known as the feast. Among the villagers lurks the werewolf, an entity who has sworn to take revenge on everyone.*

An endless spiral of deaths
*Haruaki Fusaishi will find himself stuck in inextricable loop from which he cannot escape. Conscious of his own fate, he will take advantage of all the knowledge acquired before his tragic deaths.*

Important Aspects:

- Involves the main character being an outsider in a mysterious, isolated village/town/place

- Time/Death loop (>!caused by a supernatural monster/force!<)

- Heavy sense of mystery and horror

- Involves werewolves and inspired by Japanese folklore/mythology (optional)

"lrvikd6","Left_Anywhere2717","2024-10-14 13:48:47 UTC","MICHAEL VEY SERIES! I will die on this hill that it is the most enthralling sci-fi series I’ve ever read. It’s about a group of kids who were exposed to a machine in a hospital as babies that gave them each unique electric powers!","lrv2nw2"
"lryoymb","rohtbert55","2024-10-15 00:19:07 UTC","A professor, once upon a time, told me that reading is like running. You don´t go for a marathon on your first run, you slowly work to longer distances. Same with reaading, everyone has to start somewhere.

Look up PenPals; I'm like 99% sure it´s free. It came to me because it was written for like the intenet, if that makes sense. I know a lot of people don´t like it, but give Kindle a try. I think you get like a three month free trial period, so you can experiment with a variety of genres. If you like SciFi I can suggest the Frontline series by Marko Kloos, which I absoultely adore.","lrxz4mk"
"lrylg84","teii","2024-10-14 23:57:04 UTC","Hey, if reading a book seems tedious, try short stories. If a particular story starts to lose your attention, no shame in bailing and trying a new one. Ray Bradbury's and Isaac Asimov's are the ones I grew up on. As for a more recent fantasy short story rec, I've lately enjoyed 'For He Can Creep' by Siobhan Carroll.

Or maybe you'd prefer listening to a story instead of reading it, in that case Levar Burton's podcast 'Levar Burton Reads' is great, he doesn't stick to one genre, but generally leans towards fantasy/sci-fi.","lrxz4mk"
"lsnjtdy","Crafty-Reindeer-3210","2024-10-19 07:36:13 UTC","Maybe consider reading airport novels/thrillers. Stuff like the best books by Lee Child or Fredrick Forsyth. The plot gets really compelling right off the bat and it keeps you hooked throughout. Even if you sort of skim parts without absorbing every detail you might still enjoy reading these sort of books. These books tend to get you hooked pretty much from the start (like action films) and do not really rely on fancy vocabulary or anything 'deep'.

As another user said, reading might be comparable to running in that you can slowly add small distances to your training and over time become capable of running a marathon. So maybe these type of thrillers are a good way to get 'miles under your belt' in a potentially fun way.

Also you mentioned that you do not have money in your pocket for books (especially in case you end up not enjoying it). While it is unethical, you may want to consider 'sailing the high seas' till you get enough money to support the authors who do so much for us. Of course a public library might be the ethical way to do this if that is an option for you.","lrxz4mk"

"ls7f830","SecretBox","2024-10-16 14:30:08 UTC","My personal favorite that I think would fit the criteria here is a Japanese book called ""Socrates in Love"" by Kyoichi Katayama. It's essentially the story of a young man mourning his high school girlfriend who has previously passed away.

It's not the most sophisticated book in its writing, but it is thoughtful in how moody it can be and balances the sweetness of the romance with the melancholy of the mourning. It's not in print anymore, but the book is pretty easy to find secondhand on eBay. Just remember to search by author as well, as the English title is somewhat generic.","ls5u5vu"

"lrun7tm","XBreaksYFocusGroup","2024-10-14 09:22:37 UTC","If it is a published short story - ie, not one in which you are the author or otherwise have a personal investment in - then yes, this sub is amenable. Should have mentioned that if you are wanting to discuss original short stories made by Redditors, there are several thriving communities for that.

r/Literature prides itself on having more depth to discussions. It is kind of a smaller, more gated r/Books with a higher bar for effort. It itself already had a schism which led to r/TrueLit which is the same difference only compounded. They are like nesting dolls with r/Books being top level. Everything which would be appropriate in r/TrueLit would be appropriate in r/Books but not the other way around as this sub also welcomes lighter conversation and broader subject matter. Which sub you gravitate towards most is a matter of personal taste.","lrum81h"
