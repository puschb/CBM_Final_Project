**Assassin's Quest, by Robin Hobb**

/r/bookclub finally started reading this one just as I was about to give up and just read it on my own. At this point, I'm at chapter 4 and this one has been just as good as the previous two in the series.

Finished:

**Starter Villain, by John Scalzi**

A quick read. Pretty much a spoof of the villains from spy books and movies (think James Bond villains). Also, there are cats. I liked it well enough and there were some truly laugh out loud moments and Scalzi has improved some on his excessive use of appending 'he said' or 'she said's at the end of dialogue sentences. The downside to this one is that it felt like there was an excessive amount of exposition to the point that it felt like the first half of the novel was all exposition. 3.5 stars.

**Nicholas Nickleby, by Charles Dickens**

Got through two of the monthly issues last week, those being No. 6 (Chapters 18-20) & No. 7 (Chapters 21-23). The plot has really picked up and I'm enjoying it now much more than at the start.

**The Murder on the Links, By Agatha Christie**

My 4th Christie and 3rd Poirot, and still going strong, Christie became my current favorite writer with how much I am liking her books. About this one though, I will have to say that it's pretty obvious from reading it that it's quite similiar to her previous Poirot book, **Mysterious affair of Styles**, and unfortunately is not as good as it, with most characters being quite weak with few exceptions(although characters in Styles weren't much stronger), the mystery and crime aspect of the book is pretty good though, although it has quite a few of plot twists for a pretty simple case. I will have to say that this is probably the weakest Christie book I read as of current.

Started:

**Carrie, By Stephen King**

My very first Stephen King book! I'm only 1/5 into the book, and currently really on the fence about whatever I enjoy it or not: I really like psychological and mental aspect of how King writes characters, but I don't find myself interested in the main storyline itself, what doesn't help either is that I don't really get any of the obscure references and phrases/idioms King uses in this book, it causes a little bit of confusion for me. So whatever I will like this one or not, I can't say for sure right now, but I already ordered 2 more books of his(**'Salem's Lot, The Dead Zone**) to arrive this week so I can try another one of his or continue if I'll find this one fascinating.",""

**Brothers, by Alex Van Halen**

I enjoyed this book, I'm a big Van Halen fan, but not a Van Hagar fan.  The book stops about the time David Lee Roth left the first time, then leaps to his brother's death, the late great Edward Van Halen.  Totally skips the Van Hagar era, the reunion tours, and that other Van Halen album (I forget the singer's name).

I wasn't really an Alex fan, but I respect him more, and sadly, Van Halen is no more, and the book pretty much says so without saying so.

I normally read horror books in October, but had to skip two for two SciFi/Fantasy hiking book club hikes, so I'm making up for them by these two books (first one first, then the next)

Ok, I'll use this chance to rant/ vent about the book because I *really* didn't like it. It was riddled with problems from the poor prose, to the sappy plot. And the funny thing is, it didn't have to be anything special, I didn't have any high expectations from it, I just picked it up for a light-hearted, simple read. It just had to be nice, simple and cozy.

More than half of the book is spent on the dumb ""rules"" about the cafe, which are enumerated time and time again ad nauseum. And they don't even hold up to scrutiny. Especially the whole ""the present cannot change, considering people recieve items from the past, let alone, people know/ remember visits from the future. These things should be nitpicks, but after having spent so much time at the ""rules"" at least make them coherent. 

The prose does get progressively better, if only marginally, but the previous experience of Kawaguchi as a playwrite shows a lot. The first story is essentially writen in a ""dialogue- stage direction"" style, which gets old really quick and reads like padding most of the time. On the other hand, with the new found freedom of entering the characters' heads, the narration just randomly changes POVs indiscriminately and at any moment, even going into long tangents about their past whenever it's most convinient. Thoughts, emotions and motivaitons are described instead of shown or implied and there is a weird fixation with what every character is wearing, no matter how irrelevent to the plot.

Lastly, the takeaways from the stories didn't sit well with me at all. (Especially when it came to the story Sisters.) Now I didn't expect the societal issues presented to be touched upon with much tact, it's just a gimmick book after all, but it never failed to disappoint, nonetheless. From dementia to death at childbirth, none of the stories felt like they had any fore or after thought, just serving a shallow sappy plot.

**A Brief History of Neoliberalism, by David Harvey**. A good, insightful book. Prescient in many ways, but also kind of outdated by now. I definitely get the feeling we are in a period of transition away from the neoliberal order described in this book -- and, indeed, have largely been transitioning away from it since about 2008. The swing towards populism, and usually right-wing authoritarian populism, around the world seems to signal the death of the era described in this book.

**Passwords, by Jean Baudrillard**. I'm going to need some time to figure out what the fuck this book was about.

**Magic - A Brief Introduction, by Owen Davies**. I finished this just before going to see Heilung live, which I think was impeccable timing.

Started:

**After Tamerlane, by John Darwin**. A global history which tries to walk the line between the eurocentric early global histories and the fashionably europe-dismissing histories. Very interesting so far. Deeply concerned with not just the historical events described but moreso with the way we weave these into a story.

**The Philosopher Queens, by Rebecca Buxton and Lisa Whiting**. I've gone through a few ""history of philosophy"" type books and lecture series by now, probably most notably Bertrand Russel's book The History of Western Philosophy. All of these are predictably scantly when it comes to women, and in fact in Russel's book as I recall not a single woman has her own chapter, and very few are mentioned even in passing. This is my attempt to plug those gaps in my reading so far It's mostly very short chapters about particular female philosophers (with a rather generous definition of the word ""philosopher"" to compensate from the fact that women were kept out of the official institutions for most of the history of philosophy). Some I already know pretty well, about half I've never even heard of. It's a pretty easy-going book so far, but I think it will serve as a nice jumping-off point to explore some of these philosophers more deeply.

Ongoing:

**Dracula, by Bram Stoker**. I'm liking this way more than I expected to. I was certain that the epistolary framing device would get stale, but it remains fun and engaging. You really fall in love with the characters, to the extent that it becomes less horror and more tragedy.",""

I’m just going to call him Don Q in my thoughts because his name is hard to spell and therefore type. It goes without saying that I’ll be going into Vol. 2 of the story next and then probably a summary afterwards just to make sure I understood what I missed, but first, my final thoughts.

It’s a parody but does its job well and it’s still funny in its own way. When I read, it was far from understanding everything, but I still really had a good laugh and enjoyed it. I really wish modern dialogue versions were unabridged, but I can understand why they’re not. A lot of this is background info, including random singing. At that point it’s established people are either confused or playing around anyway. However, some of it is not.

About halfway through, the duo goes to an inn. Most abridged versions leave out why, and it just seems like it’s coming out of nowhere. In reality, they stopped for the night and Sancho doesn’t properly restrain Don Q’s horse. Normally this would not be an issue, but a bunch of mares just pass through by chance. The horse runs off, and tries to unsuccessfully mate with the mares. They reject him and their owners are not pleased. This results in the horse being attacked and injured.

Don Q is understandably angry, but less understandably misreads the situation as malicious rather than an accident and attacks the attackers. He end up being injured too, although the duo is able to leave. That’s when they find the end, and they realize they need to rest. So that’s exactly what they do. 

That scene almost completely taken out in abridged versions, and it’s a bit understandable because most of the abridged versions are meant for younger readers and I’m not sure how they would tone that down. One version I had at the counterattack, but little else. To be fair, what happens at the inn is much more important (it’s where Don Q becomes a knight and Dulcinea is publicly mentioned) but it’s still some information that’s left out. A fair amount of the middle of the book is left out, such as a lot of the background of the supposed princess the duo finds, and that’s mostly extra information. But it still would’ve been nice to know and understand.

The full book, like most classical literature, Is very hard to understand because of how it’s written. Since I knew the general plot but was having trouble deciphering the writing, I just decided I didn’t want to deal with it right now and I would look up a modern summary after read both parts. 

It’s happening quite a bit with the classic literature, and well I appreciate what they did and understand what they did for reading as a whole, it can be a bit frustrating. If I was reading for my professional life or anything academic I would definitely be reading more seriously and really trying to understand the text as written, but it’s a bit annoying it that I have to go into professional mode to understand what’s going on without a summary (sometimes even with). I still like it in the its own way, though and it definitely has its own place in books itself.",""

When I happened across this book, and learned that it was from the same creative mind behind the psychologically dark and twisted yet gripped story *Helter Skelter: Fashion Unfriendly* (a book I would very much recommend by the way for people who enjoy stories such as those), that made this one go up there on my priorities list.


Anyways. It primarily tells the story of Yumi, a 22 year old office lady, who moonlights as a prostitute for the purpose of making extra bank so she can keep her beloved pet crocodile (that's right, a crocodile) fed properly. And a college guy named Haruo, an aspiring novelist with nothing to say, who sleeps with women who could be his mother's age. Not for money, but basically to work on his ""powers of observation"". And a few other characters in their orbit.


So yeah, if that base description doesn't say something right out the gate at how atypical this cast of characters are, just wait till you see what kinds of stuff they end up saying and doing. Cuz I tell ya, it's a doozy. Not anywhere near as dark or twisted as the aforementioned book by this author by still. But while their general attitudes, ways of thinking, and interactions with each other, not to mention the croc Yumi keeps in her apartment which a whole big crux of the story are kinda interesting enough facets about this one and kinda help make them endearing if atypical characters. What I kinda found interesting about this one was that, while these people exhibit atypical traits and behaviors, they're not really the kinds of people whom you'd expect to do those things. You know, people at the at the end of their rope, people with bad pasts and traumas facing crushing amounts of depression and such, or just general deviants (for the most part...). They just do these things by choice because they want to. And not to the point of being self-destructive about it either.


And what does this story all try to say. Whatever the heck you want it to say that's what. Is there some deeper kind of symbolism and such to all this madness. Heck if I know how to parse it out. And I don't think these characters would either. They're atypical people in an atypical story doing what they do and enjoying the things they like that in the end make em happy. And if you're the kind of person like me who enjoys these kinds of stories, it may just end up making you happy in some chaotic way too.",""

A Little History of Religion, by Richard Holloway

How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie

I liked both. A little history of religion was great, and a bit of an eye opener to be honest. I would consider myself an atheist and this book kind of confirmed by grip on that, but I should clarify that if anything this book was pro-religion (I don't want my previous statement to sway people to believe otherwise). The book was great at explaining the origins and histories of each major religion in the world today, and was a quick, informative, and easy to digest read. How to Win Friends and Influence People was pretty good, but a little outdated. The book was originally published in 1936, and with how different things are now, especially so with modern technology, a lot of the principles/lessons I read in the book are just outdated and a little redundant or maybe their claimed effect they would have was exaggerated. Nonetheless, the large majority of the lessons in it were good and still hold up today, almost a decade later, so it was still a great and informative read. 

  
Now, I'm reading:

The Intelligent Investor,  by Benjamin Graham. 

I've been wanting to learn more about the stock market and thought this would be a good place to start. It's going good, and with only being 8 chapters in I feel like I already have learned a decent amount from it. It is a bit textbook-ish, and not the most fun to read, but I just gotta make myself get through it because I believe there is a lot I can learn from it. 

  
I've been reading a lot of informative/self-help books (as these books show). I want to continue to do so, but after I'm done with The Intelligent Investor I might wanna take a break and read a fiction book or just something a bit more enjoyable lol these informative/self-help books are great but definitely should not be the only thing I read.",""

Dostoevsky just crushes it when it comes to analysis of the human psyche.

Knox wrote seven novels between 1927-1937. They are all out of print and hard to find but I have managed to track down three of them and this week I have been reading my way through them.

Knox was one of  the founders of the 1930 Detection Club and was responsible for laying down the rules for detective fiction that have since been followed by the likes of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers. et al. It was of interest to me to see what his own efforts in this genre were like since, effectively, he invented it.

I was impressed. I love his style. You are very much aware of the authors presence and get the feeling he is telling the story to you personally - a technique that pre-echoes Kurt Vonnegut. Every change of scene is prefaced by an insightful and poetic description of the location that can also be witty and sardonic. Characters are vivid and well-described.

From the structural point of view his plots are wicked. His detectives do not keep everything to themselves leading to a great Poirot-like dénouement at the end. Instead we share their thought processes and hear their various attempts at reconstructing the crime. The result is that theories change as new information becomes available, they frequently get it wrong and we are lead down various garden paths. Up until the end, different theories are put forward and the final solution is inevitably a surprise.

Two cops are called to a residence where a car has been left running in a closed garage for a suspiciously long time. Upon entering they find a body in the kitchen overcome by carbon monoxide fumes, and the body of a golden retriever puppy in the garage. They shut off the car and open the garage door but when they're back at their patrol car - they see the puppy crawling out of the garage. 

The puppy is adopted by Mason (""Mace"") Reid, a dog trainer with a side-gig helping law enforcement agencies: he trains his own dogs as ""cadaver dogs"", taught to find human remains. But as he trains the new puppy ""Vira"", he finds out a couple spooky things: 1) Vira is very very smart, and 2) Possibly as a result of her near-death experience, she has a special ability, practically a doggy superpower, that goes beyond simply locating bodies. Inevitably, Mace and Vira get caught up in the police investigation of a serial killer.

This is a greatly entertaining book, one that you just can't put down. This is especially true if you're a hardcore dog-lover (as I am), you will absolutely love this story. Mace, Vira, and Mace's other dogs are given strong personalities (his older male German Shepherd is named ""Sue"" and is a hoot).

This was very much in the same vein, including the premise (a person missing on the planet, which triggers an off the books mission to locate and bring them back).

**The Saint of Bright Doors, by Vajra Chandrasekera**

This 2023 fantasy novel won the Nebula Award and was shortlisted for the Le Guin prize. It's Chandrasekera's debut novel. The protagonist is a fascinating young man named Fetter who floats on air, is impervious to fire, and who has no shadow. Fetter's strives to break free from his dysfunctional family and the religious cults that surround him (with limited success). It's a wonderfully weird story with excellent prose and an imaginative plot. I very much enjoyed this one and would reread if I have an opportunity.

"lw21t2j","Gary_Shea","2024-11-08 10:18:25 UTC","Finished: **Character Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter** by **Kate Conger** and **Ryan Mac**. This is a book in two halves. First there is the tale of the Musk takeover of Twitter. It is finance, it is law, it is a tale of sociopathic behavior on the part of a lot of people in very high places. If you ever enjoyed the book **Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco** (1989) by **Bryan Burrough** and **John Helyar**, you will enjoy the first part of this book. The second part is about what Musk did to Twitter (events described are current up to late 2023).

Was Twitter destroyed? As a company the answer is no, but nearly so and it may well succumb yet and perhaps soon. It is indisputable that Musk was forced to pay the full $44 billion he offered for the company and so at the time of the takeover there was an indisputable public valuation of the company at $44 billion. Now that it is a privately held company, it is hard to value the firm, but some of its revenue streams can be independently estimated and the authors cite some numbers, the worst of which results in a 75 percent reduction in the total asset value to £11 billion. That's very much a worst case scenario, but I think one thing is clear: the company's value now puts its ability to service its debt (and Musk's personal liability that he has been attempting to spread across Tesla and, perhaps, Space\\_X) at risk. The Twitter/X business is, let us say, financially precarious, but not destroyed. (Discuss)

In the first half of the book (and this is the reason I mention **Barbarians at the Gate**) I was struck by the way corporate higher-ups so casually consume corporate resources. Now if we could imagine a company that is totally privately owned and with no obligations to creditors or its workforce (hard to imagine, right?) you would say, ""Ok. If he owns the company outright and wants to consume its income in perks, why not?) But that was not the case with RJR Nabisco or with Twitter, which were publicly owned. Just as Nabisco execs seemed to be preoccupied with Pro-Am-celebrity golf tournaments, pre-Musk Twitter execs always seemed to partying somewhere or working from 'home' somewhere like Hawaii or Tahiti. (There seem to be a lot of video conference calls with palm trees in the background. It raises interesting questions about what corporate founders actually do and whether they add much value to the corporation after foundation.) Anyway, you cannot blame Musk (too much) for this kind of behavior. He has other pathologies. And one thing you cannot fault the last Twitter execs and board members for is that they failed to follow through on a stupidly high offer for Twitter shares. Their decisions may have destroyed a unique corporate culture and harmed the lives of many very talented and dedicated employees, but boy did they maximize shareholder wealth.

Which anyway brings us to the really interesting questions about Musk and his talents and his liabilities. What the book establishes is that his talents certainly do not lie in day-to-day management of certain types of companies, of which Twitter was one. Is he a day-to-day manager of Space-X or Tesla? I don't think so. He is not a space scientist, rocket engineer, car designer, expert on assembling lines or battery technologies. We know that at one time he was an original software designer in certain categories, but I would suspect that his skills in that regard are now quite stale.

So what does he do and what is he good at? The book demonstrates what he tried to do at Twitter and we could surmise that he did (and does) with much greater success at Tesla and Space\\_X. He can inspire certain types (not all types) of very talented people and drive them very, very hard. Very hard. This talent has worked so far at Tesla and Space-X, but has failed miserably at Twitter. Even before he financially shot himself in the foot with Twitter it was public knowledge that he must never, never be a CFO of a publicly traded company. A CEO maybe, but CFO never. Court cases and SEC directives re Tesla have demonstrated that.

Finally, there is Musk himself and his mental states. Take away from this book that there is much to be concerned about not only for the sake of Twitter employees and Tesla shareholders, but for all his employees, his family (families?) and himself. The book does not hold out much hope for interventions on any of these fronts. Buckle up everyone, turbulence ahead.",""

An Evil was more about criminal behaviors and focused on his mind. But if your into mystery suspense books that keep blowing your around every corner I definitely recommend these two. Chris Carter has more books but unfortunately my library only carries these two but soon I will probably buy them all. At one point y'all I had started reading 4 books in one week and didn't get them all mixed up.",""

Of course this is dense and difficult and not always interesting, but it's related to some writing I've been working on. I read the first part of it 40 years ago, and I figured it was a good time to dive back in and refresh my memory.

The most interesting thing (that I hadn't thought about much the first time) was how different their experiences were; Freud was providing therapy for wealthy patrons, mostly female, while Jung was working in horrific conditions in a mental hospital, trying to figure out the patterns of schizophrenia. The hardest thing reading it is that there was so little known at the time and they were, in effect, inventing a language to speak about their ideas. That language and understanding has changed since, so it's hard sometimes to follow their ideas.

The other interesting thing is just the personal side between them, which they were very aware of themselves; Freud was the older figure and tried to be both dominant and nurturing, while Jung generally deferred to his experience. That Jung's own experiences were so much more extreme and information-packed (to put it one way) caused some friction, and it was interesting to see how they danced around that problem.",""

* **Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line by Deepa Anappara**- Expected urban fantasy, got traumatised. 10/10, I'm very glad I read it. 

* **Masters of Death by Olivie Blake**- This was genuinely a ton of fun, I loved it. I might read more by this author.

* **Faebound by Saara El-Arifi**-This was just really good NA fantasy, I enjoyed it a lot. I'm definitely going to read the sequel when it comes out. 

* **The Fascination by Essie Fox**- I only picked this up because the cover was cool, but I really enjoyed it. I think I'm just good at sensing books that I'll like at this point...

Currently reading: 

* **Blood Justice by Terry J. Benton-Walker**- I read the first book recently, so I decided to get the sequel while it was cheap. It's a really fun series, I love SF/fantasy that isn't remotely subtle about its themes. 

Other books I might read soon:

* **Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters**-So I guess we doin sarah waters now. I really liked fingersmith, so I thought I'd check this one out.  
* **The invisible Life of Addie LaRue by VE Schwab**- I probably should have just got this from the library because I'm not sure about the author so far, but it was cheap so

I'm only about 10 chapters into Demon Copperhead (10٪ of the book) but so far I'm LOVING the writing style. The tone is just so fluid, and it all is very conversational and relatable.

My thoughts on the main character is that ->! She's an unreliable narrator. Either things that happened actually happened or she imagined it all. The bus lady reading aloud the symptoms of Schizophrenia seemed like a clue and a foreshadowing to me. Plus oftentimes, when she's thinking, she tends to think out aloud making others around her ask ""What's that Samantha? What did you say?"". But then It doesn't feel right to just dismiss it off as imagination. It definitely happened, something magical.

Especially Moscow and people's everyday life down in the metro.

Dangerous monsters excluded of course (the mutant wildlife on the surface weren't mentioned in the book at all (except for the ""dark ones"" but those are a very special case with a logical explanation, I can't say more!) but mutants are present in the 2033 computer game though)

"lvz13af","Delicious_Lychee9156","2024-11-07 21:53:47 UTC","I thought all the books in the Scholomance series were a solid five stars. El is easily one of my favourite FMCs and the worldbuilding is just amazing. I did struggle with the Golden Enclaves more than the first two books. I hated El’s cheating (I can’t call it anything else) which for me came out of nowhere and seemed entirely unnecessary to the plot. But this book does bring all the different strands of the trilogy together, gives you a lot to think about in terms of moral dilemmas and social commentary and the plotting is just awesome. I love it when I find a book I can fall in love with and this trilogy definitely delivered. I find it much harder to talk about books I love than those I hated, don’t know why.","lvtmbmj"

"lw7zkmc","Gary_Shea","2024-11-09 08:24:10 UTC","Thanks for reacting to my little comment. I really appreciate it because I have been largely disappointed in this subReddit which results in so little thoughtful interaction between readers. So, forgive me when I get genuinely excited about discussion of an author I have admired and collected (yep, 1st edition nut here) for many years.

It has been awhile since I read **Our Man in Havana**, but it is in a line of works that Greene himself called ""entertainments"" as distinct from his ""novels"". I believe that Greene was good at remembering absurd incidences or opinions he encountered in his actual life and exploiting them in his entertainments. He served in the intelligence services in Africa and London during the war and did subsequently write autobiographically about some of the absurd elements of the life of a spy, particularly the degree to which it depended upon old-boy networks of wartime London. The biographies reveal that the plot line of **Our Man in Havana** has some basis in fact! There was a desperate scam artist living in Portugal who made a small living in concocting fake intelligence reports for the Germans. Trying to interpret schematic drawings in intelligence reports was a real issue that Greene was aware of and so concocting a plot line that involved slightly disguised drawings of a hoover as a weapons system or some other nefarious thing was an idea that tickled his fancy and, well, you've just read the result.

Now the morality of **Graham Greene** used to be just the biggest biographical controversy about him.  It seems quaint now, but people did really agonize about whether Greene was ""a Catholic author"" or, as Greene put it ""an author who happened to be Catholic"". This was all the rage when people seriously worried about whether Kennedy could be a fit and loyal President if he was a Catholic! He notoriously converted to Catholicism and he also had big moral lapses for which he would be hugely remorseful. And then he would wink at the public who worried about such things. He publicly made political and moral stances that he would frequently violate. The he would be remorseful, maybe and then wink at you again. The morality of Graham Greene is an entertaining biographical treasure hunt.

The main biography is  **Norman Sherry**'s 3 volume authorized biography of Greene. I am in the middle now of the most recent (much shorter) biography by **Richard Greene**. There are many more dating from the 1960s to the present day.

Will discuss anything you want on this topic.

with regards,

"lw8timl","PresidentoftheSun","2024-11-09 13:21:07 UTC","When I said ""morality"" I was honestly more concerned with whether or not the guy was a racist. Again, couldn't find anything concrete on that front. I'll be honest I'm not sure how you got from morality to his religious affiliation.","lw7zkmc"
"lwq1c1d","Gary_Shea","2024-11-12 09:04:42 UTC","Well, religion usually informs morality. Religions are largely moral codes after all. But religion rarely determines morality in the individual. I know quite moral persons who despise religion and know (and know of) quite religious people who are also quite morally depraved.

Anyway, the question whether Greene was a racist or not would hardly have been topical in his day and his biographies reflect that lack of topicality. The preoccupation of the day was his religious sincerity, so that it was what they wrote about. Even the biographers who thought he was religiously insincere and linked that to his morality would have not included racism within the scope of his immorality. There are obvious reasons for this.

If you look at the societies Greene moved in and the causes he undertook (sometimes to the hazard of his life) in places like Mexico, Haiti, Liberia and Vietnam it would be hard to credit that he was consciously racist. He would populate his novels with racist characters to be sure, but any honest novelist would have to do that in the settings he was trying to portray.

The ultimate Greene novel that combines rabid and casual racism with religious immorality and irreligious morality in all their possible permutations is **The Heart of the Matter**. I personally would not even try to detect the character of Greene through the words and actions of his characters, especially in a serious novel like **The Heart of the Matter.** My main concern is whether his fiction is true to life.","lw8timl"
"lwqqk1s","PresidentoftheSun","2024-11-12 13:05:35 UTC","I don't agree that religion informs morality, there's no evidence that you can't get one without the other. You can get extremely religious members of the same faith with wildly different states of moral integrity. Morality as we know it certainly doesn't require religious inspiration, *animals* exhibit a range of moralistic behaviors from basic proto-morality to something nearly as complex as our own, as seen in chimp troops.

In another twist of poor word choice, ""concerned"" is probably the wrong word. I'm not entirely ""concerned"" that he was a racist. Again, see Lovecraft. I would just like to know. Whether or not the issue of his day was his ""religious sincerity"" is pretty irrelevant to me and the way I interface with reality. He could have secretly been a Satanist for all the difference it makes to me.","lwq1c1d"
"lxqtvxj","Gary_Shea","2024-11-18 12:14:24 UTC","I think we actually agree. ""inform"" has a pretty expansive meaning. I meant by ""religion informs morality"" something more like ""religion often has something to say about morality"". It does sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. And there are certainly moral codes and moral philosophies that are very distant from any religious basis.

So when it comes to Greene I think we will have to leave the issue of possible racism at this: 1) If he had racist tendencies, it certainly did not feature in his nonfiction, nor in the interests of any of his biographers that I recall. (I will look again at the Michael Sheldon biography which is regarded as doing a hatchet job on Greene and see if there is anything there.) 2) Greene's fiction is full of racist characters. I think that Greene was such a skilled writer that you will be hard put to detect the author's voice through the voice of his characters. Critics of his fiction have claimed that Greene was especially detached from his characters' vices and virtues; he was so detached that it was hard to discern ""the man within"". Critics and biographers have not been able to convincingly decide on his religious sincerity, so I don't think anyone will be able to determine whether he was racist or not. He was just too good at his craft to be put into any category on the basis of his fiction.","lwqqk1s"
