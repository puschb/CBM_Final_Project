Like the Great Gatsby (don't ask me what happened between beginning meeting Jordyn and the ending car accident, and I've read it semi-annually since I was 14), Howl's moving castle, Virtual Light, Brave New World or, stupidly, the short story We will it remember it for you wholesale. Idk if it's something about the plot, the writing (although, in case with Fitzgerald and Gibson, I love and have perfect memory of their other works) or something else.

My guess would be something about the headspace, where there's going on a lot in your life, so your brain isn't all there in the reading, and it becomes background noise, which you don't really digest the way you would normally. But also maybe the whole annotating and stuff might be the things holding you back, where you stress more over the text as if you're doing schoolwork, instead of actually getting lost in the sauce and getting the emotions (sadness, stress, happiness) almost chemically bind to your memory.",""

Plot is just there for structural purposes, it's more of a writer's tool to be mastered for the reader's convenience while reading, than actually enriching the reader's life long-term.

Are you reading books from a series, or just a bunch of random books? Don‚Äôt just read a ton of books just to claim you‚Äôve read 50 books in a year. Instead try to spend your time reading fewer but more memorable books.

Try reading (or at least skimming through) the novel a second time. See what new details might stick out about the story you might have glossed over on your first read(especially mystery novels when you realize there were clues you missed).

Try reading a series that has an overarching plot and recurring characters. Trilogies(and longer) have become very popular the past 20 years or so across multiple genres. These usually stick to set timelines, so remembering the order of events through them can help remember the previous books.

Try reading multiple books by the same author. Authors usually stick to a personal writing style, so their books may become easier to remember if you start to recognize common things between them.

Read more ‚Äòexpanded universe‚Äô books. Fantasy and Sci-fi have tons of series like this - Forgotten Realms, DragonLance, and of course Star Wars). These tend to reference each other, making it easier to recall events from other books you may have read.

Probably not a great suggestion, but maybe watch the adaptations of some of the novels you read? Some movies get a bad rap for not being faithful to the source material, but some are great adaptations. Look up reviews or blogs dedicated to reviewing how well an adaptation was, then go watch the movie if it got decent to high reviews.",""

Another one that actually got me out of a reading slump with its fast paced writing and decent plot is First Lie Wins by Ashley Elston. I dont remember a lot of what happened in it but i devoured the book in a day (which was much needed after my year long reading slump)","lqwtsax"

If your current psychology / neuroscience knowledge is not helpful enough, then

there may be a way that can kind of fit in-between reading and notetaking for fun and studying rigorously. Zettelkasten. Scholars and neurodivergent folk are known to make use of it for knowledge management and or to compensate for our deficits. r/Zettelkasten r/Zettlr","lqwe1i4"

"lqx7uag","LadybugGal95","2024-10-08 11:17:03 UTC","Sorry for getting irked but my point still stands. If you can‚Äôt remember the details of your day from three months ago, you aren‚Äôt going to remember your reading unless you do actually treat it like study material to the point you could teach it without notes to someone else. If you can teach it to someone else without notes, you‚Äôve internalized enough to probably (not guaranteed) remember it six months to a year from now.

Also, whether you remember it or not, you‚Äôve internalized it and it has already changed your worldview.","lqx6xgp"

"lr13936","Deleted","2024-10-09 01:36:05 UTC","I think a lot of it is that the newness wears off and after a while you feel like you've read it all. I start to think of books in categories if that makes sense, they start to run together. If I get something really new or brilliant, I remember it a lot more over the years, but that happens less and less the older I get. Films are the same way after a while.","lr11u0t"

Any story can include sci-fi themes or a romantic plot in it. The horror genre also tends to get mixed in with sci-fi. Or some books/movies are getting classified as horror even though they aren‚Äôt proper scary horror novels.","lqwprz0"

They are truly special novels.","lqx3zsk"
