"lxmajxm","oqqas","2024-11-17 17:20:06 UTC","Jude and Willem are very dependent on each other, they define each other. >! I think Jude wouldn't have died so soon if Willem were still around, but if they never resolved their codependency we'd see the same result no matter who died first and how. !< 

To me, the main 'points of the book' are... 

One, showing the limits of what love can and cannot heal. >! Jude's friends and found family made his life better but ultimately wasn't able to fix his physical and psychological trauma. At some points Willem thought his love was enough to 'fix' him and enabled Jude when he was missing his therapy appointments. !< It's hard to say what was the right decision but we get to see the consequences and think about the 'what ifs'. 

Two, bad things don't happen to people as a punishment, sometimes it's just life happening. >! Jude thinks his abuse happened because he's inherently a bad person, and that good people don't deserve those things. But in reality, there's no divine reason why some children get incurable diseases or why someone dies in a car accident compared to anyone else. A good example of this is when we learn Caleb (an awful abusive person) dies of pancreatic cancer and Andy is glad he died painfully. In my opinion, this reinforced Jude's idea that his own physical suffering happens as a consequence to his inherent 'badness'. Later we learn that Richard, someone who was only presented as a great person, dies of brain cancer. Once again there's no reason why these things happen, they just happen. Harold is someone who has seen the high and lows of life and has the strength to continue living despite it all. !< 

And third, life can be unfairly short and painful but there's always reasons to enjoy a beautiful little life (hahahaha) while you have it. 

There's also something to be said about justice and what that means to Jude ( >! especially as a lawyer and mathematician !< ) but I haven't fully turned the idea around in my head yet, I'd love to hear anyone else's thoughts on that.",""

"lxlllua","ef-why-not","2024-11-17 14:58:34 UTC","I don't think your questions are unreasonable. In fact, these are the exact questions Yanagihara wanted us to think about. You might want to check how she herself speaks about the book.

To me, it feels like she doesn't view her characters as persons (albeit imaginary), more like mental constructs that she wants to conduct experiments on. She has chosen Jude as a subject and she just adds tragedy after tragedy after tragedy to see what can make a human being break. Besides, remember how Jude is a genius, an excellent lawyer, a million people love him unconditionally? So she adds a good thing after a good thing after a good thing to see if there's enough good that can be done to a human being to undo the work of pure evil. Her work is a novel, but it's also a treatise in a way. Her thesis is: there is a certain amount of pain (and a certain type) after which no amount of good makes a difference. And the book is written to prove this point. To my mind, it's horrible, unfair, disrespectful, atrocious, etc. But that's my opinion and I managed to think it through after I'd read the book and spent an absurd amount of time thinking about it. The author's opinion is different and she's entitled to it. I hate the book but I'm glad I read it.

>!As for Willem, in my view, no, his death is just another bad thing in Jude's life. He had been broken beyond repair way before that, so no, Willem staying alive would not have changed Jude's predisposition to die. He was destined to die from the very first page. But that's me thinking logically. As a fellow human I wanted to kill the author for killing Willem. I stopped feeling things for Jude at some point because there was a certain amount of torture porn I could take but Willem was a nice person and he didn't deserve to bloody die. !<

I feel you. I can't stand the book and I would never recommend it to anyone but I think it is needed as part of the conversation on how to REALLY deal with trauma and help people who have to deal with trauma. This book just shows what NOT TO DO, how NOT TO ACT and how NOT TO THINK.",""

"lxmarwb","dearestkait","2024-11-17 17:21:20 UTC","I definitely understand folks’ criticism of the book, but my takeaway from it (which maybe speaks to where I was at the time I read it) is that suffering doesn’t necessarily beget survivorhood. The boys constantly expect Jude to, at some point, magically move from victim to survivor, but this is unrealistic. Sometimes our suffering and trauma don’t make us better people or legible to those who haven’t experienced it—and sometimes we simply cannot “get over” the ways the world has hurt us. I see the book as pushing back against “survivor” narratives in this way. Jude often is only alive because of his relationships, and those relationships aren’t “enough” to “fix” him. So when they fall or die or leave him, he’s back where he started. We can appreciate the beauty and love he experiences in life with those folks without expecting them to fundamentally change the depression and self hatred he’s trapped in.",""
"ly2d16z","hyalophagia_","2024-11-20 07:13:01 UTC","I unfortunately loved this book. I think it is wrong and perhaps even unethical to recommend it to people because of the extensive, detailed, varied depictions of trauma, though, and rarely talk about it despite the fact that it’s a comfort reread for me that I pick up at least once a year. 
I’m quite sleep deprived but I will try my best to sum up my thoughts:

1. As an extensively traumatized disabled queer person who has been horrifically depressed since early childhood, the descriptions of Jude’s physical and mental pain were horrifyingly relatable and the first time I read the book I had to put it down constantly to think long and hard about what that meant about me. I have rarely felt so seen and understood as I did while reading this book for the first time.

2. Willem and Jude’s atypical relationship style as a result of Jude’s trauma was extremely validating to me, an asexual person who had difficulty with physical intimacy due to trauma and is nonmonogamous as a result. The fact that they were able to find a way of loving each other that helped and brought comfort and joy into their difficult lives was so important to me.

3. The point of the book, to me, is that awful fucking things happen to people. Statistically, people who experience trauma are more likely than their untraumatized peers to experience another significantly traumatic event, and that is reflected, dramatically and rather unrealistically, in this book. It is also true to my own experience, and like Jude, I have suffered as a result. But, also like Jude, I have survived because of support, spite, stubbornness, perhaps a bit of stupidity, and the fact that even in a truly horrible life there are so many small pockets of joy if you know where to look. There are songs to be sung and cakes to be decorated and art projects to make and careers to pursue and friends to love and cherish. There are people who will welcome you into their lives and their families and their homes. There are people who will meet you where you are and who will try to love you through your pain. And even if the pain doesn’t get better, and even if the best you can manage is a neutral feeling about yourself, there is still so much good. 

4. I see this, for my own sanity, as a thought experiment about how men who refuse help may suffer. Jude is prideful, private, ableist, and full of so much shame and self hatred. He is incapable of showing up for himself or allowing others to help. And the reality is that there are many people, especially men, who live this reality. They refuse every single ounce of kindness, they do everything in their power to hide how much they’re hurting, and they just want to push through so as not to be fussed over or embarrassed or hurt or known or experience the uncomfortable and unbearable reality that is being truly known and loved. Yes, this is what life can look like if you refuse therapy or can’t access it or don’t engage with it fully and honestly. Yes, there are thousands of people who do this every day. They’re codependent and self harm and fucking suffer, and no amount of outside love or support will fix it if they are not willing or able to work on it themselves. And some people simply will not. And I don’t think that that makes a bad story. I think that makes an incredibly touching and compelling story full of painful and heartbreaking moments.

5. I often wonder how this story would be received if it were about a woman.",""
"lxp01md","Sweeper1985","2024-11-18 02:26:49 UTC","I am a psychologist and I hate, hate, hate this book.

What's the point? Well, apparently the point is that *people don't recover from trauma*. Which would be true if it was presented as a ""some people under some circumstances"" thing, but instead is presented as an author tract on learned helplessness. Safety doesn't matter. Support doesn't matter. Treatment won't work - let's not even try it. You will never recover because you are damaged goods for life.

What a fucking appalling and ridiculous message to send. Especially from an author who admits firstly that she has no lived experience at all of the things she writes about (whether it be child sexual abuse, or men's inimate relationships with each other) but also is PROUD that she has not taken any time to research any of these things because she considers that her imagination or opinion presents a trump card.

I could literally spend the next hour listing the things I couldn't stand about this book. Fortunately a lot of this has [already been pointed out](https://www.vulture.com/article/hanya-yanagihara-review.html) far more eloquently, from Yanagihara's trite repurposing of her luxury travel copy, to her abject failures of research, to the horribly precious way she treats Jude, who is one of the least likeable (or even interesting) characters I've ever come across on a printed page. But even with that done, I can't look past the multiple ways that the novel becomes ridiculous by dint of how unrealistic, inconsistent, illogical and flat out ridiculous Jude's backstory is. For instance: there is an established child protection system which he is not placed in. Something something, there were no available families to adopt him, so instead of placing him in an orphanage or foster care, as is done with every other child.... let's just dump him in a monastery. Even though they don't have any experience caring for kids, have no clothes or toys for him, etc. And just leave him there for years with no social worker to follow up, ever. EVEN THIS ALONE is so fucking stupid it makes the rest of the plot seem farcical.

And much of the rest of the plot IS farcical. Jude is the very best at everything - he's the best lawyer, maths prodigy, baker, opera singer, and I forget how many other special talents he has but somehow even though he's so amazingly traumatised that he's cutting himself to shreds every night, he's able to compartmentalise it all and work 100 hour weeks and also go to all his friends' social events and keep everyone rapt in his sparkling conversation before he goes home to fall apart again. And somehow even though he's a terrible friend who refuses to work on his problems at all (or even acknowledge them) he is surrounded by people who adore him for no good reason, who shower him with praise and love and support and money, who take his side in everything. An A-list movie star pursues him romantically and says he is the most beautiful person he's ever seen. His professor literally adopts him and bequeaths him his fortune. He has a loyal doctor-friend who treats him for free and risks his career by not reporting Jude's ongoing self-harm. And still with all of that love surrounding him, all that (unrealistically) unconditional love and support never for a single moment help to heal Jude in any way. Not one iota. And nobody ever gets tired of him, or snappish, or tries to force him to seek help, or distances themselves when he won't.

He's not a character, he's just misery personified by someone who loves misery.",""
"lxlnln2","Birdsandbeer0730","2024-11-17 15:10:37 UTC","I have a love hate relationship with this book. LOVE the writing, love the relationship dynamics, love Harold’s chapters. I do believe Jude’s backstory was a bit overdone. It’s like the author wanted to find absolutely everything imaginable to make his life unbearable. Trauma Olympics are what I like to call them, and Jude takes  gold no matter what. If Dr Traylor didn’t happen, Jude’s trauma would still be valid, and same if he never left with Brother Luke. I’m not sure why Hanya’s editor looked at all the passages of (yes, Jude’s torture) and thought it was a good idea to release ALL OF IT. I don’t know what the chances are of having that horrible of a life and the chances of running into that many horrible human beings. 

I wish we got more of Malcom and JB. Hanya set up an interesting premise for their characters and just let it go to waste. Why was Malcom such a pushover? Did he and Sophie love each other at all? How did JB learn to forgive himself? I would’ve loved to explore that in the 800+ page book, but no. We needed to see Jude’s life get progressively worse. 

I might be the minority here, but I do believe Jude would’ve not killed himself had Willem lived. After his amputation, he seemed to get better. They went on nice trips and they had each other. I think he would’ve struggled physically for the rest of his life and he more than likely would’ve died before Willem. And yes, Willem’s death was unnecessary. But drunk driving is unnecessary, and cruel and unfair. 

I’m extremely long winded when it comes to this book. It stays with you forever. Sometimes I find myself going back and reading certain passages because I miss the writing

Also Andy is the true villain in the story",""

Just the premise of 4 friends meeting in school,  becoming ridiculously successful in their chosen fields, and staying close friends forever was so unbelievable. Add in the self-harm, torture, and adoption, leaving me calling for an editor and checking the publisher's credentials.

I'm glad that's not the case for most people but I felt incredibly emotionally validated if not from the book itself from Jude as a character.

The abuse in those pages is not uncommon - it happens, to plenty of people all over the world, and in more intensity than you would like to think. This book was a study in the unrelenting nature of trauma. Sometimes, you will never recover. Sometimes, it cuts so deep that there was never going to be any way out. It’s hopeless for a reason. Some people carry trauma with them in a way that warps their very being - they end up in terrible situations, in and out of psych hospitals, in perpetual suffering. Very few recover in spite of it. 

The point of this book? Not all suffering can be lived through. Trauma can sometimes be inescapable. Human experience can be distilled in the lowest of lows and the highest of highs and the book almost brutally demands you look at the lows.

It's amazing as well, but less traumatic I guess? But it's good, I love her writing and thoughts and ideas and themes. 

What made me love A Little Life is the fact that it helped me mentally a lot, and it still does. In a cathartic way, in a way I could relate to Jude's self harm and the way it was pictured, with these thoughts and also from the way other people around him reacted to it. Gods... I never ever felt anything that close. It helped me to understand, to accept, to start healing. 

If there's some deep trauma that just can't be healed fully, because it already kinda replaced parts of yourself, you need to learn to live with it, day by day, deal with worse days, deal with better days. Have someone to catch you, to understand you, to accept you even when you're still hurting - and do this without judgement, without anger yet without emptiness and distancing. It's hard, almost impossible to ask for. Lots of people failed Jude, even his father, even his partner. With time Willem learnt how to love Jude though, in a better way, in a gentle way, in a way that didn't hurt Jude. Partners learn this, it takes time. No one is perfect. 

If Willem stayed alive, Jude would live longer of course. Jude came as close to happiness as he could, it's stated clearly in the book. He loved Willem. And was loved by Willem long before.

Why Hanya killed Willem? 

There are books with morals, with some stories that teach you things, where everything happens for a reason etc. but in real life lots of things just...happen. For good of it, for bad of it. Traumatic events happen, wars happen, just terrible accidents and happy ones. Some have reason, some were brought by us, by our actions or lack of them, but there are still... accidents.

I believe in some way it was shown to us that despite no healing effect, no cure for Jude's mental issues, William was still some kind of answer to Jude. Love, acceptance, support can't heal all the wounds and traumas, but it doesn't mean a person (Jude) is beyond saving and should be given up. It shows importance of just living one day after another with him, showing support and love daily, keeping him breathing. That's all. You can't save him, but you can hold him for a bit longer. And it matters.",""
"lxtklj5","souplover5","2024-11-18 21:20:02 UTC","I knew the book was going to be trash when I read an article by the author in which say says, ""I wrote my second novel, *A Little Life*, in what I still think of as a fever dream."" The Guardian wrote: ""...she wrote the 375,000 words of her book in something of a 'fevered' state every night for 18 months on coming home from work.""

I'm usually not one to judge a writer's process, but admitting that you shat out a few hundred thousand words in a frantic, obsessive-like state indicates to me that it's probably not going to be a good book. Books like that, in my experience, tend to be lacking in literary merit. It's just a story that lacks the analytical thought and editing to make it a *good* story. See *Things We Never Got Over* by Lucy Score. Also a terrible book, also written feverishly. 

Her editor argued to let go of some of Jude's trauma and I agree. The villains in this book are comically evil. And yes, some people in the real world do face indescribable horrors. But in this story, there is no meaning to it all. There's nothing to hope for. It's just so utterly devoid of any joy. The ending is a closed case and doesn't give the reader anything to think about. A Little Life just has absolutely no purpose. 

Jude's suffering is so cartoonish and exhausting too that it could not even illicit an emotional response in me. Every single traumatic event in his story is like a 10 out of 10 on the Horror Meter. How am I supposed to care when everything is so extreme? Where is the build up? I don't know if the author was hoping for shock value, but it doesn't deliver when Jude goes from being trafficked and SAed to kidnapped and ran over to kicked down a flight of stairs. A somber, traumatic story can be told well, but not when it's just constantly extreme. 

Also, it is unreasonably long as fuck. 200 pages in and the author is still writing exposition. Absolutely ridiculous and most of the exposition didn't even matter. It just built the anticipation of the answer to the question, *wtf happened to Jude?* I stopped caring about the rest of the story when everyone was just trying to answer that question. I cannot believe this was a Booker prize finalist.

I'm sorry you read it and that it's still affecting you.",""

It was always interesting to me that Jude as a lawyer chose a corporate career and didn't decide on helping other people and fighting for justice (no Atticus Finch in him). I found it really hard to picture him being aggressive in the court of law, though. Had to take Yanagihara's word for it.  

As for maths, do you remember the passage about the axiom of equality? I know next to nothing about pure mathematics so I'm not even sure it's a real thing (Google seems to only know about it through A Little Life itself). But the fact that Jude's favourite axiom is x=x and nothing can change it whatever happens, only reinforces Jude's view of himself. I think Jude's views on justice have been compromised from the very beginning because of his ""upbringing"" in the Monastery. After all, if all you hear from day 1 of your life is that you're bad and evil and have no value, you learn to believe it and it's incredibly hard to let go of it in your adult life.","lxmajxm"

I didn't see it as them wanting him to ""magically"" make changes so much as they hoped he would utilise the supports around him and at least try to work on his issues so that he could obtain some relief of his distress. That is realistic, and it's what we ask of people in real life. He has the means to access any form of treatment available, he has a doctor in his corner advocating for him and trying to refer him to services, he has loving friends and adoptive parents who want to be there for him in every way they can, and even try to minimise his access to means of self-harm.

Malcolm, in retrospect, is depicted as admonishing Jude, quite cruelly, when Jude tells Malcolm that his father loves him: ""parents love their children"" (to paraphrase) Jude says to comfort Malcolm, and Malcolm meanly returns ""and you would know all about that Jude"".

We sense his guilt and Harold's repeated critique that he is going into the 'dark side' working with the 'big shot money guys' and other such like phrases. Jude fears for his future alone, old and 'disabled' and knows he will need constant around-the-clock care.  If he remained in the attorney's office he would never earn enough to pay for such medical care. He does pro bono law work with poor artists to counter that he is in the epicentre of capitalist gains/law. Also, I did think, as you say, why didn't he perhaps go down the criminal law route so to aid in the prosecution of criminals who hurt children as he was abused, but then he isn't mentally or emotionally capable of such a lawyer role. He is too traumatised.  He would relive events in the work place, the 'hyenas' would enter and he would not function professionally.  Jude is described as 'machine-like' a figure cruncher, that's why he is such a successful lawyer in the corporate sphere because it is numbers based and he can use his math 'genius' and  'cold' logic to enable extortionate non-illegal firms to undo each other.

Regarding Jude's aggression in court - yes, that is difficult to picture and he is 'bifurcated' as Harold observes, but he doesn't shout at people or scare the whistle-blower witnesses, he is again cold and logical, resilient even and I think this mannerism is evident in his personality in domestic every-day life too, but it is clothed in fear and passivity and quietness, shyness too.

It's not new (published in 1995) and it obviously isn't as brutal as A Little Life but! it's a memoir that details the author's childhood and all the terrible things that happened to her but the author's point in telling the story was that your childhood, no matter how horrible it is, doesn't have to define you forever. It's not easy to read (it's tough because it's a true story not because the author wants to sensationalize suffering) but it might work as an antidote to A Little Life if someone wants a more humane perspective on the issues Yanagihara discusses.","lxlri46"

I did and still think willem went through a lot and I worried about his well being, anxiety and stress in that section. He has a lot of anxiety and is utterly spent on a couple occasions, and I find myself feeling for him (even now, more than many people seem to feel for him). He is not perfect and he does engage is questionable actions, but like someone said I do think he was the last straw and the source of Jude’s new found joy or whatever and the grief completely destroyed him.

If all that won't be able to make those people think a tad bit about why another person would appreciate the novel despite the fact they don't, that would be their problem, not mine. If the hate is to be so intense, then so be it. They will be being the kind of insensitive bullies they accuse Yanagihara of being of and I'll make sure to call them out for that hypocrisy of theirs. Not going to lie, those few upvotes my comment got, helped a lot, in a sense that they helped me realize that there maybe be a few people out there, in this sub, who not necessary love the novel-they may even fiercely hate it-but who regardless of their personal feelings on it are willing and capable of engaging in constructive conversation about it and listening a different perspective on it instead of dismissing it by parroting the same three or four things most people do when the book gets brought up.","lxqptw1"

Similarly intense / tragic books: 

Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller (an easy one to start with. None of the torture, but lots of longing, anguish, and tragedy.) 

Captive Prince by CS Pacat (torture, rape, explicit violence, then somehow turns into longing, trust, redemption, and true love. Certainly not everyone’s cup of tea.) 

Manacled by SenLinYu (this is a Dramione fanfic that is VERY dark. I didn’t even ship Draco and Hermione, but this one has all of the dark intense elements. I and everyone I know was walking around in a daze after reading it.) 

Your Blood, My Bones by Kelly Andrews (no rape or sexually explicit elements but lots of torture, doomed love, bitterness, and tragedy.) 

And for some reason The Goldfinch by Donna Tart gave me a similar literary vibe. Similar(ish) plot of a boy growing up lonely and unloved, finding his community, falling in love, and then kind of having everything ripped away. Very melancholic but less hardcore elements. Maybe a bit slow to get into. 





Edit: I feel like I have to add, that most of these are gay romance tragedies SO to add a little balm for the heartbreak… if anyone needs a sweet and gentle GAY pick-me-up romance after all this torture and sadness: I want to recommend Gwen and Art are Not in Love by Lex Croucher which made my gay heart very happy.

Also ONE MORE THING, the characters in this book are all wildly successful and rich. People who have gone through the things Jude has gone through don’t succeed like he did, and if they do it’s extremely rare.

It’s a harrowing autobiographical novel about CSA written by a self identified poor white trash/working class lesbian.   Les Feinberg’s *Stone Butch Blues*, John Rechy’s *City of Night*, *And the Band Played On*, James Frankie Thomas’ *Idlewild* for some insight on what may be going on with Yanagihara and her relationship to gay men.  

Yanagihara’s relationship to queerness and trauma is currently both voyeuristic and disgustingly privileged (check Andrea Long Chu’s takedown for the actual cash receipts of her lifestyle magazine-funded tourism) and that’s a kind of detachment that can only be countered by a good dose of reality.   It’s writing that should never have left AO3 but found its way to mainstream publishing because Yanagihara has industry connections.  I’ve seen a few transmasc writers question the tourist allegations and suggest that her “torture session with the boys, chapter 83/?” fanfiction style relationship to gay men and their suffering is classic closeted gay ftm behavior, and the intense helplessness and misery is basically sublimated gender dysphoria from a trans person who refuses to transition and wants to make that everyone else’s problem.

The first seemed really ok for the majority of it but in the very end it left me with a knot in my stomach. The second part is divided into another two sections. The first section is the most positive thing Yanagihara has ever written imo. Of course there are sad things in there but the fact that the main events unfold over the course of a single night really helps since they are just brought up and the reader does not engage with their full emotional impact. But yeah, without spoiling i will say that the protagonist manages to rebuild his life in the future and have a realistically happy end. The second section is kinda sad but too foreign for me to really relate persoanlly. As for the Third part, it has also been very unsettling in many ways, and I still have 80 pages or so left.

Long story short: it's not nearly as depressive as ALL but still far from a happy read. I will say though, that the emotional chords which it attempts (and imo manages) to touch are much subtler.","lxz8ckm"
