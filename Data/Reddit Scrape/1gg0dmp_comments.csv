The host was better written than the Twilight Saga but wasn't a big seller and she never finished writing the rest of the books.
I heard the chemist was alright for her first adult book. 
It seems she's still tied down to Twilight especially by fans. She has said she doesn't want write another book in Edward's POV despite many fans begging and demandingly she do so. Yes her writing has grown with Midnight Sun but it would nice for her to write something else. 
She received so much hate and backlash for a book that was basically what romance fantasy and booktok is today. She also use to interact with fans a lot but doesn't do so anymore due to hate comments, etc. 
It sucks because apparently she use to be super passionate about writing and all the stories she wanted to share with the world but that doesn't seem to be the case at the moment. 
Even as a person who likes the Twilight Saga as a comfort book and film series, I wish the author would be given the room to grow with her other books. And said books be meet with more interest.",""

"lum4bsl","SwiffMiss","2024-10-31 00:01:04 UTC","I don't know if he was always this way, but Andrzej Sapkowski, the author of the Witcher series of novels was offered a percentage of shares or a lump sum by CD Projekt to adapt his novels into the Witcher games. He ended up taking the lump sum which was worth around $9000 and got super salty when Witcher 3 hit it big because he didn't expect the games to do well. In fact, he was even offered royalties but refused because he had so little faith in the games.

He later started bad mouthing the games saying things like ""they ruined the novels and made people uninterested in them"" and eventually sued.

Dmitry Glukhovsky, author of the Metro series (which also was adapted into video games) later commented on it and called Sapkowski arrogant; pointing out that the games would have increased interest in his novels.

Wrapping this all back around, I feel like Sapkowski got more popular because the game adaptations drew more attention to him and his books and he started behaving badly afterwards. If I recall correctly, some people have also said his novels started to dip in quality after the Witcher 3 came out but I haven't read any of his novels so I don't actually know. But yeah, increased fame may have effected him both attitude wise and creatively.

"lum7ns2","NowGoodbyeForever","2024-10-31 00:19:47 UTC","GRRM is, for all intents and purposes, a success story. I've really grown and evolved in my feelings on this over the years, but...you can't force someone to finish a story, and no one could accuse him of sitting on his hands and doing *nothing*. He does exactly what he wants, for better or for worse. I imagine he's always done things this way.

His incredibly nerdy books became one of the most important shows in modern media history, before collapsing in on themselves due to an entirely different creative team's problems with fame and popularity. (Seriously: The worst we can accuse GRRM of is Writing Too Slowly. But D&D, the showrunners? They rushed and cut short a hit series so they could try and make a Star War, and fucked up so badly they lost the gig in the end anyway!)

But then he took what's essentially a *collection of worldbuilding notes and fanwiki entries* and turned it into a second, smash-hit prequel series, this time with far more creative involvement. He has a cordial relationship with fans, he has his hobbies, he does things for charity, and he continues to contribute to his world in the ways that seem to interest him the most. I feel like this is pretty similar to how we'd see Tolkien conduct himself if he were around today, you know?

So, to answer your question, I think you named my actual answer: **Patrick Rothfuss.** Because...at least GRRM wrote 3 books before his pace slowed down significantly. And GRRM has always been frank and honest about his progress (or lack thereof) when it comes to his work. But Rothfuss? Where do I even *start*?

He followed up a phenomenal and promising first book with a flabby, meandering, and oftentimes embarrassing second book. We joke about his main character **Learning Sexomancy From The Goddess Of Sex So He Can Out-Sex The Sex Ninjas**, but...that's all shit that literally happens.

He insisted from day one in the text and outside of it that the Kingkiller Chronicle would be a trilogy. Some years after the 2nd book, he clarified that it's actually ""A trilogy setting up the first part of the wider story."" Okay.

His use of charity funds and relationship to his fan community is *incredibly sketchy* at best, and it continues to give me a real sense of a dude languishing in the glory days.

Finally, I think what's most insulting about Rothfuss is the work he has put out in the meantime. It would be *incredibly* generous to call them novellas, because I know a writing exercise when I see one. It's the literary equivalent of a filler episode, short stories digging into the backstories of characters we don't know enough about to love, framed like they're lovingly-crafted works of fan service. ""Finally, I'll know what Bast and Auri were up to before they met Kvothe!"" said *no one but Patrick Rothfuss*.

Say what you will about GRRM, but he got his shit together enough for HBO to bankroll the most expensive show ever made (at that time) behind his work and his brand. And the powers that be were ready to do the exact same for Rothfuss; just a few years ago, people like Lin-Manuel Miranda and Sam Raimi were attached to write original songs and direct episodes, respectively. All of this evaporated because you cannot plan a series around an unfinished trilogy that has essentially positioned its final book as The Thing That Will Make It All Make Sense. A Song of Ice and Fire had a lot more for its showrunners to work with, even when it was just 3 books with 4th on the horizon. Rothfuss' inability to produce has literally cost him a prestige adaptation. We're in a Rings of Power and Wheel of Time world now (to say nothing of House of the Dragon), and I don't know if there's room for a Kingkiller Chronicle series. Again, I have to imagine this is on Rothfuss.

Maybe it's just me. But I can see where GRRM struggles; the story he had in his mind has been shared and told, and he seems to be finding joy in charting new paths. The Hedge Knight stories are some of his finest writing, and the most recent one dropped just before A Dance With Dragons. He still knows and loves this world, and seems to be trying to find ways to tell stories that still interest him and let him do his thing.

Meanwhile, I feel like Rothfuss is frozen in place with a classic case of overpromising and underdelivering. We've all read a fanfic that promises The Most Epic Conclusion In The History Of Epicness, and then falls flat simply because the author's skills and imagination cannot bridge that gap. I think Rothfuss was such a good storyteller in that first book that he fooled *himself* into believing he could capture everything he was hinting at. And then when it came time to make the legends real, he realized he was mostly writing horny pulp fantasy about The Coolest Boy Ever.

And again: *That can work.* I've read all of the Dresden Files; I'm totally fine with pulpy, one-note fantasy adventures, imperfectly written with passion and energy. But Rothfuss refuses to even commit to that; he's promised the world, and that's all he can really do now. Promise, and pray that he'll figure out how to make those promises a reality.",""

"lum5x3p","DonQuigleone","2024-10-31 00:09:59 UTC","The problem, it seems, with GRRM is a problem shared by many writers these days: inability to nail an ending. I think this generally separates the good writers from the greats. For great literature, you want the whole thing to be coherent and held together, with most of the action throughout the story pushing towards and foreshadowing the conclusion. For comparison, consider Shakespeare, an author operating in a similar genre. Shakespeare generally nailed his endings. All of his tragedies have satisfying complete endings. ASOIAF is admittedly much longer and more complex, but that perhaps shows a flaw as a writer, in that starting off plot threads without knowing how to fittingly conclude them is poor writing. 

In general, I'm of the school that authors should start with a beginning and end in mind, and then work forwards/backwards to fill out the middle. And then revise the whole thing many many many times to sort out the kinks. Unfortunately the modern trend of sequelitis and shared universes make this impossible, as you end up writing in an open ended way so nothing has to end. 

In this sense, I don't think GRRM has been damaged by fame. In fact I'd say he's taken it quite well (I'd say fame has much worse effects if the person is young eg the 27 club). More likely GRRM is now filthy rich, he's bored of the setting, and he's just not motivated to finish.",""

Ross Poldark, aka the first novel in the Poldark series, was written in 1945. Bella Poldark, the last novel (unfortunately because Graham died, there was rumour of another) was published in 2002.

There was a 20 year gap between novels 4 and 5, with Warleggan coming out in 1953 and The Black Moon in 1973.

Graham was also quite famous, as other than Poldark, his most famous novel was Marnie, which was adapted into a film by Hitchcock with Sean Connery.

This is great for creating believable characters and interesting stories, and you're not forcing your characters to make weird choices just to move the plot towards a specific end goal. However, it is terrible if you want to end it because you never actually knew where you were going, and you've now created dozens of storylines and problems that you can't just resolve satisfyingly. 

A big reason the final season of GoT sucked was because every season prior was the characters acting authentically and receiving the realistic consequences for their actions, good or bad to heighten drama. Then the last season changed it up completely and instead, they had an end goal of where everyone needed to be to *resolve* drama, and then 1) made people make inauthentic choices that put them where the writers wanted, and 2) having things happen to them irrespective of their choices.

On 18 February 1895, the Marquess of Queensberry left his calling card at Wilde's club, the Albemarle, inscribed: ""For Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite [sic]"".[168][e] Wilde, encouraged by Douglas and against the advice of his friends, initiated a private prosecution against Queensberry for defamatory libel, since the note amounted to a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of sodomy.

In his opening speech for the defence, Carson announced that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. On the advice of his lawyers, Wilde dropped the prosecution. Queensberry was found not guilty, as the court declared that his accusation that Wilde was ""posing as a Somdomite [sic]"" was justified, ""true in substance and in fact"".[185] Under the Libel Act 1843, Queensberry's acquittal rendered Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses Queensberry had incurred in his defence, which left Wilde bankrupt.

Every great artist seems to have experienced at least one of the following:

	1.	Living in poverty or close to it
	2.	Struggling with addiction
	3.	Managing a mental disorder
	4.	Enduring near-death or traumatic experiences
	5.	Facing heartbreak from losing someone, something, or even part of themselves

In other words…struggle.

Once you get rich, you’re insulated from these struggles. You have far fewer experiences that cause genuine grief, which means you’re somewhat shielded from life itself—and in many ways, you become less relatable.

Here's a famous picture of CDPR showing off Witcher 1 at E3:

So a couple of points, first the article just starts of with a factually incorrect statement. 

>> ""I made the games popular. All of my translations in the West - including the English one - were published before the first game.""

>> This is just - factually incorrect? The Witcher released globally on PC in October 2006. The first Witcher book released in English was The Last Wish, which arrived in 2007, and the first novel, Blood of Elves, wasn't published in English until 2008.

She claims Sapkowski was wrong and the first game came out globally in 2006. It came out in 2007, a few months after his first book finally appeared in English. He's not wrong his book got a translation from a major publisher before the games appeared.

>> The author has said in the past that The Witcher games have lost him as many book sales as it brought in, and asked about this maintained that it ""would be about equal, yes"".

So she says this without attribution. What he actually said was the video game  screenshots being used as cover art at one point probably cost him sales, because people would have thought they were tie-in media and not the original work. He was probably still wrong, but he didn't say what she is claiming he said.

>> ""There are more people who have played the games because they read the books,"" he added. ""That's my count, but I'm not sure. I never did any studies.""

This may have been true initially, in Poland and some parts of Europe. Obviously not true in the rest of the world, especially after The Witcher 3. But this brings me to my next point:

Keep in mind how old Sapkowski is and his background. He's in his 70s, and grew up and wrote the first several books in Communist Poland. Video games were largely not a thing, and even by the time he was publishing the Witcher he likely was only exposed to 8-bit stuff and probably still thinks of Pac-man when he thinks of video games. Most people in their 70s don't understand that video games are a major media platform making more money than almost any industry.

When it comes to the payment from CD Projekt, a billion dollar company that people online loved to defend until Cyberpunk 2077, yes he initially chose a single payment instead of royalties. That's because they weren't the first company he licensed the video game rights to and he got screwed because the other company failed at the project. He later went back and did sue them to get paid more, because Polish law allows that to protect creators from greedy corporations taking advantage of them. At the time, he had a son, Krzysztof Sapkowski, who was sick and wanted money to help pay for that. Sadly his son passed away before the lawsuit was settled. CD Projekt was not harmed by this, they are still doing fine and obviously aren't that angry with him, considering they have more Witcher projects on the way.","lum4bsl"

The Expanse finished its entire 10 books in the 13 years since Dance came out and Corey just released the first book in their next series a couple months ago. So huge productivity loss for GRRM not to have an assistant to keep him on track like that.

And I'm not defending Rothfuss, I agree with all your points but I will say, that everything you have pointed at is probably maximized and intensified with his mental health struggles, which he's talked about.","lum7ns2"
"lun74zk","Anaevya","2024-10-31 03:50:30 UTC","Your comparison of Martin with Tolkien is more accurate than most people think. Their writing process is extremely similar. Tolkien even did the whole endless rewrites thing. They're both discovery writers who write very slowly while being crippled by their perfectionism. It's a good thing most people back then didn't know that the Silmarillion was a thing, otherwise they'd probably have criticized Tolkien like Martin is criticized nowadays. 

Many people don't care about the Silmarillion as a book, but they forget that readers back then didn't even know what kind of being Sauron is (he's a fallen angel, an Úmaia aka a demon). The Silmarillion provides so much valuable context. It also features Sauron as an active character doing very vile stuff, which makes his evil feel less like a mere literary device. It's more tangible. 

Sadly George doesn't have a Christopher, it seems that the Expanse authors could've filled that role, but one of them apparently stated that the time for that has passed. I have no idea, if this means that he doesn't like George anymore or if he simply wants to write his own stories.","lum7ns2"

If he just tried to finish it, he probably could, but there’s so much pressure and expectation that he must be going out of his mind.

If he’d written one page per day since ADWD released, he could’ve rewritten the entire five-book series again. This is obviously optimistic given editing, rewrites, publishing stuff, etc. but it’s still an accurate comparison IMO since we’re only talking about two books (though two more complicated books, I’ll absolutely grant).

It’s been a thing for years that it would never be finished, and he’s been bitching about fans who want it the entire time. Imagine how great his life would be if he did finish it. He’d have even more fame than he already has (though it would be a bit more niche since the show fans are likely much larger than the book fans) and he’d get to live his life in peace without people constantly hounding him for the book he keeps promising. His legacy would be a fantastic story that he wrote, not a story that he didn’t finish that got “finished” by a tv show that had a historic fall from grace in the final seasons after being a cultural icon.

I just find it both disappointing and incredibly scummy. He keeps promising the book and complains when people ask him about it, but he has no problem cashing the check when people buy his stuff. Maybe I’d have a bit more respect for him if they put on the front of all of his books “author will likely not finish the story and will complain like a child if you ask about it” or something like that. Either that or definitively say that the book isn’t coming out so people don’t buy his stuff under the guise that it will be.

Rowling could be living in a castle thinking all the shitty things about transgender people she wants - or better yet, not actually thinking these things, because she should be busy enjoying her millions - but instead she has to go and piss away her legacy.

You can contrast that with other authors who probably believe - or at least tolerate - kind of lousy things, but who know how to keep their mouths shut. Brandon Sanderson is a Mormon, he *almost certainly* has opinions about non-straight people that would get him in trouble. At *minimum* he is a member in good standing of a very hierarchical and dogmatic church with these beliefs, which means that he is willing to *tolerate* those ideas, to entertain them and not speak out against them.

But even beyond ASoIaF, if you read his collection of short stories ""Dreamsongs"", there are an inordinate amount of stories that starts with him saying ""this was supposed to be the first story set in a new Universe, but then I got bored with it.""

He loves creating worlds and little stories set in them, and once they get going he loves seeing where they take him; but once he's written that first short story, it's like he's done. He can't go back.
He's mentioned many times that he's not a planner, but a gardener; he doesn't make a planned structure and then fill in the blanks, he likes to scatter his seeds of ideas and see which ones grow, weed some here, tend some there. One day, a flower will bloom and there's his finished work!

With ASOIAFF, the second he sold the story to TV, he was required to set the ending down in stone; just the general framework of it, but it meant he could no longer meander his way towards it and weed what didn't work and tend the stuff that did; he had to imagine the flower fully bloomed.

They start with an idea, bite off more than they can chew, overdevelop the middle as  they fall in love with their own world, and only ever had a vague suggestion of an ending in mind, if that.

That's also why progress on them inevitably slows as they go on. Very few come out regularly and consistently for the entire series.","lum5x3p"

A good ending is nice and all, but for me it's about the journey and the world building (at least when it comes to fantasy). I don't actually care if GRRM finishes and I think ther s actually no real satisfying way to do so, but I actually think that serves the books and made them the modern masterpieces they are. Besides Tolkien (who is on another level entirely) you'd be hard pressed to find someone who has so thoroughly fleshed out a fantasy world than Martin.

I don't really share your viewpoint, so I guess that's why I feel taken back from it. I'm happy to live in the complex world he made and enjoy the rich history and characters within. The books, for me, feel like I'm reading a history of planetos post Roberts rebellion, and not necessarily a traditional fantasy novel, and from that perspective, I don't see how can you actually end something like that","lum5x3p"

As a writer I do all of this, and mentioning this to my therapist was the last straw for her thinking that I have a mood disorder. Transferred to a psychiatrist who cited Ernest Hemingway as having the same writing process and suspected to have had cyclothymia which, in very simple terms, is like a junior version of bipolar 2.

The reason I bring this up is because as you age, it's possible for it to worsen if you never address it. And seeing success once, no matter the gravity of it, can really impact how you go on to do other things because you know you're capable, but the idea of not being able to do it again can become paralyzing. Success becomes the reason you end up self sabotaging down the road and it all honestly really sucks to go through. It's suspected that this contributed to Hemingway 's death too.

The entire first book is this kid who claims to understand stories going out and making every storybook mistake he possibly can. He creates his own problems, and *claims* to be skilled while failing to actually apply those skills while self-sabotaging at every turn.

The universe keeps placing ways out in his path and he continually ignores them.

There's a reason why in the frame story Kvothe keeps saying ""This isn't that kind of story"".

I still find the takes on what's actually written in the series kind of astonishing.

The surface level read is that Kvothe is all-skilled, but only because he says he thinks he is. But if you even look slightly under that you'd see he's really only got the potential to be very skilled, but always chooses not to continue down that path. Instead it's a tragedy how much pain he causes himself and the people around him. Young Kvothe marvels at his own skill while continously being called out by the people around him for being an idiot, and for some reason readers still walk away going ""OK, so he knows everything"". How is this still a take when there's so many people who call him an idiot, even his older self?

"lummieq","NowGoodbyeForever","2024-10-31 01:43:15 UTC","Totally! My major gripe with DnD, though, is that they took their ball and went home. If I recall correctly, they had some sort of unique contract situation going on with the adaptation rights of GoT. If GRRM and others are to be believed, HBO was open to going all the way to 10 seasons. I'm not saying that would have saved anything; like you said, people involved were *exhausted.* And having to recast Daenarys after 8 seasons would be a train wreck.

But it is well established that *they* wanted out and to move on, and ended the show at a quicker pace than anyone else asked for. It's super common for showrunners to bow out while a new creative team takes over, but that wasn't the case here.

And one last snipe I'll throw their way: The problems revealed themselves long before the final season. The writing fell off a cliff as soon as they ran out of books to adapt! I know this plays into what you said about them being unable to resolve what the author himself couldn't, but again: As showrunners, you need to be able to recognize when something has moved beyond your skillset. DnD are fantastic at adaptation, but once they saw that cliff rushing up to meet them, the sensible move would have been to shift their approach and bring on writers who are stronger at writing new things.

GRRM is still just responsible for his own work. His work impacts a ton of people, but he's still a contract worker who gets paid when he delivers. DnD sunk an entire ship when they easily could have handed the steering wheel to someone else.","lumdq4i"

Most authors never hit it that big at all, and for the ones that do, it's very rarely the first book that gets them there. 

She's never been a small author. And I don't think she knows how to. So she constantly tweets outrageous stuff to get the spotlight on her, and then the TERFs in her audience egg her on by saying she's standing up for women's rights. It's a cycle.","lunky2o"

My favorite writer of genre fiction is Le Guin and I find her views on Rowling’s work to be spot on:

Question: “Nicholas Lezard has written ‘Rowling can type, but Le Guin can write.’ What do you make of this comment in the light of the phenomenal success of the Potter books? I’d like to hear your opinion of JK Rowling’s writing style.”


Le Guin: “I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the “incredible originality” of the first Harry Potter book, I read it to find out what the fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid’s fantasy crossed with a “school novel”, good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited.”

And another take, this one in response to JK running with Le Guin’s concept of a wizarding school:

“This last is the situation, as I see it, between my A Wizard of Earthsea and J.K.Rowling’s Harry Potter. I didn’t originate the idea of a school for wizards — if anybody did it was T.H.White, though he did it in single throwaway line and didn’t develop it. I was the first to do that. Years later, Rowling took the idea and developed it along other lines. She didn’t plagiarize. She didn’t copy anything. Her book, in fact, could hardly be more different from mine, in style, spirit, everything. The only thing that rankles me is her apparent reluctance to admit that she ever learned anything from other writers. When ignorant critics praised her wonderful originality in inventing the idea of a wizards’ school, and some of them even seemed to believe that she had invented fantasy, she let them do so. This, I think, was ungenerous, and in the long run unwise.”","lumyw8h"

That also meant that in his head, he was done with ASOIAFF. He might not have written it yet, but since he’d “finished”, there was no longer any fun for him to write, just work.

I think it’s kind of innovative that she didn’t just write a sequel books, but did Pottermore, let some people do a play she gave some guidelines for, did try screenwriting with Fantastic Beats and did spa ring world in past and in other countries, let a game and adaptations be made. Even the wizarding world is loved by people. You are just assuming it was about money (and I don’t think it’s wrong for authors to get money for their work and she gives to charity a lot). 

To me it’s good authors get control more over these things. Usually Hollywood just completely ignores authors input. And seeks to profit most of authors after their death (like Tolkien). She doesn’t have complete control (like some assume) but could make demands like all British cast for HP films and Peeves for new series that other authors could not. I think it’s good there is another adaptation because I never really liked the movies and books being adapted again aren’t remakes.

I don’t think people have to watch or like all of these. But she and Martin are pretty much the only authors with real power with how their work is used by Hollywood and I think she has done interesting things.

I'm sure he felt it was time to unleash his inner muse from such petty restraints and let the genius flow, but tragically he has now discovered the value of outlines and planning and guardrails, as his 'garden' has grown wildly out of control and more closely resembles a jungle of unchecked growth far more in need of a ruthless machete than any more fertilizer.

I am bluntly of the opinion that Martin is just simply is out of his depth having never learned the value of the discipline which once provided his bread and butter. Martin is a serviceable if pedestrian writer who does just fine when he has a story to tell, but here, having intentionally abandoned his story, he finds that he has no clear goal beyond writing more words and hoping for the best.

However, the fact that they renegotiated and he was able to reach a better agreement, means that he served his interests by acting salty. If he had been all ""aw, shucks, I made the bet and I lost, now I have to be a good sport about it"", then he would have got nothing.

Even though I agree that no one pointed a gun at him to make him sign the original contract, I have some sympathy for him, as I think a writer is often in a situation of inferiority when negotiating with a corporation. They have much more experience and information, and they take advantage. The writer can easily feel he is getting a good deal while the corporation knows full well they are the ones getting the good deal.

Sapkowki, in particular, is old, grew up in a communist country and probably was very naive about the reality of the gaming industry when he signed that contract. He had had experience with local videogame adaptations where he never got paid because the project failed, so probably the upfront payment sounded great to him, without realizing that a major game release is a completely different story.

Later, when his son got sick and he needed money to pay for better care, he got angry at how little he had been paid, and I can understand it, even though he signed the contract.

Good for him for being able to get more for his creation. The company probably didn't mind paying him a bit more to keep him happy and avoid bad publicity, and if everyone is happy who am I to criticize. 

 In fact, apparently Poland has laws to protect the creators in situations like this, which might also have played a role in the company deciding to negotiate with him.

Having said that, I agree that even if he had got nothing from the adaptations, the worldwide publicity the games and TV show gave the books have been a great net positive for him in the end.","lun2y6h"

They wanted to shave their beards. A lot of people were emotionally done with the making of the show, not just DnD. 

I believe the main cast originally signed contracts for six seasons, and then some time in 2014, there was renegotiation of the contracts that involved a potential seventh season. It didn't matter how popular the show was, there were probably a lot of people who we're ready to leave after the seventh season, and that would have resulted in a ""new class"" of characters suddenly being front and center. 

Then in 2016 it was announced that the main cast members had signed on for seasons 7 and 8, with 8 being the final season. So it seems that they had determined that it would be impossible to finish the story with the episode tally they had left, but if they could get just one more season, and some extra long episodes, they could get the story across the finish line. 

I get that the back half of the show has narrative issues, but the whole narrative of ""DnD rushed the ending so they could go make Star Wars,"" always rings false to me when it really seems like everyone involved (DnD included) stayed longer than they had originally planned so that they could get some kind of ending to the story they'd spent the last decade of their lives creating.","lummieq"

Secondly, that when D&D went to GRRM for the story past the books, instead of showing them how the story winds down, Martin showed them several chapters of new characters, new locations, more plots. Basically GRRM wanted this thing to go on for 10-15 seasons(I think he even mentioned this publicly at one point). That's why they cut GRRM out of the writing process because he just wanted to milk the golden goose.

I enjoy the actual process of writing, and I'm excited to see a complete written work, a story verbally told is not enough.

I think the problem is, writing is work. It requires discipline. It's also a craft. If your interest is chiefly in ""discovering the story"" and you lose interest once that's finished... maybe you're not really interested in writing. You're just interested in telling stories.

--------------

Let's be serious, here. When it comes to GRRM, pretty much none of this conversation is really about process or ideas about art. It's about people's expectations and often feelings of entitlement to an author's time.

He's made it clear in comment after public comment that he continues to work on this, but is having trouble concluding things satisfactorily — or something like that. Whether you choose to believe him is your business.

He also continues to work on other projects.

But fundamentally, his time belongs to ***him***, not his audience.

-------------

It's not like I don't know what it's like to have a favorite author who leaves things unfinished. Tolkien was the master of getting things 50-90% done, abandoning them, and then restarting them later. But I'm glad he wrote what he did, and I've been happy to read his unfinished works that Christopher edited and released over the years.","lun8w9t"

There are a lot of very well regarded novels and books that have taken far longer than a year to write!

Pretty famously, Tolkien spent something like a decade and a half writing *The Lord of the Rings*, which released 17 years after *The Hobbit*. And that's just the first example that comes to mind in the same genre.

Plenty of authors take their time or only release a book when they have something they think is worth releasing.

And then there are authors who pump out something about once a year. Maybe even more frequently than that. They're *very efficient*, but the books are often pretty mediocre.

Creating art isn't usually something that happens on some strictly controlled timeline.

She burns the city with no remorse for it's people because they didn't immediately flock to her side upon her return. She sees the throne as her birthright, she expects the commoners to worship her as a long lost queen come to save them from the evil tyrant. When they don't immediately bask in her radiance she interprets that alone as a betrayal, and Dany has repeatedly demonstrated a propensity for extremely harsh punishment.

Was the last season rushed, and otherwise hot garbage? Absolutely. But Dany ""suddenly"" going insane wasn't the issue. Plenty of other parts of her story could, and should, have been handled better, like the fallout with Jon after KL, or with the Tarly's, or the Maesters in general.","luoa7le"

John eventually confronts her about being too wierded out by incest and she feels she is at rock bottom.  She goes into kings landing and she see’s what she believes is white walkers invading.  She panics and uses her dragons to kill them which accidentally ignites the wildfire below and destroys a ton of kings landing.  

John confronts her believing she has gone mad and she goes into his arms for comfort and he kills her like how it went in the show.  We never learn if she actually saw white walkers or if they were delusions.

1. There already was a failed attempt at making a Witcher game before CDPR

2. CDPR has literally not released a single game when signing the deal, they only did localizations into Polish.

3. There was not a single successful Polish video game at the time. And frankly, there have not been a worldwide success until Witcher 3

4. To my knowledge there was not a single successful adaptation of book to a video game

4. The reason that the 1st game worked, was because of the massive following it had in Poland. Without being tied to the Witcher the first game as a stand alone would not have made it.

5. He was already in his 50's when he signed the deal to have his books turned into a medium which he knew nothing about.

The adequate comparison of the situation would be someone walking up to you, and offering you a % of money made from TikTok adaptation of your book series.

Yes, The Witcher was popular *in Poland*. And that's fine, and that's great for Sapkowski (even though he didn't like that show, go figure).


But unless you're Polish then saying the Witcher was a popular book series before the games, you're lying your ass off.

 It's classic hubris brings miasma until the hero confronts said hubris. We just didn't get the confrontation, perhaps we never will.

""Rowling's views on trans individuals were first noted in 2018 when she ""liked"" a tweet that described trans women as ""men in dresses"". This garnered criticism from her fans who accused her of being transphobic. Her spokesperson told [PinkNews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PinkNews) that Rowling had ""favorited"" the tweet by mistake.[^(\\[78\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_J._K._Rowling#cite_note-79) In December 2019, Rowling tweeted support for [Maya Forstater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Forstater), who lost her job with the [Center for Global Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Global_Development) due to [gender-critical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-critical) views, and is the subject of [*Forstater v Centre for Global Development Europe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forstater_v_Centre_for_Global_Development_Europe).[^(\\[79\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_J._K._Rowling#cite_note-loses_tribunal2-80) In 2020, Rowling spoke out against a [*Devex*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devex) article for using the phrase ""[people who menstruate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_who_menstruate)"" instead of ""women"". She stated that denying the reality of biological sex erases the experiences of women worldwide and eliminates the possibility of same-sex attraction.[^(\\[80\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_J._K._Rowling#cite_note-81)[^(\\[81\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_J._K._Rowling#cite_note-menstruate-independent-82) ""

I don't think this kickstarted with her having valid concerns about cis men abusing the liberties given to trans women so that they can attack cis women. It started with her thinking that trans women are 'men in dresses'. And that people with 'gender critical' views should be supported. And that the existence of trans women is anti-lesbian. This is all anti-trans. Concurrent to all this she was writing a Robert Galbraith book where the main villain is a transvestite murderer. I think she really just genuinely dislikes anyone AMAB who is trans or gnc.","luoxerd"

Her long stint trying to break the bonds was filled with existential crises (plural), loss, regret, and disappointment - I mean,  she didn't even fully accomplish her goal and you get the feeling that her death would signal a return to many of the old ways because killing a few leaders couldn't roll back centuries of culturally normalized slavery (like Reconstruction's hard turn after Lincoln was assassinated), any more than telling her husband not to kill the one herding witch couldn't unrape all those women and unkill all those men. 

That woman told her nothing but the truth and had every reason to hate her and the Dothrakis, and she burned that lady alive. That's how we got dragons again,  through an act of hideous vengeance against a very relatable character. I thought that laid the metaphorical groundwork rather nicely. 

And that constant betrayal that she faced over and over again, like you said that's damaging, and it's just part of get entire life,  violence and betrayal. And what has been the usual response to those betrayals... violence, often extreme violence. Her husband poured a pot of molten metal onto her brother's head,  ffs, and she was just like...""dragon's don't burn."" 

Now don't get me wrong, hated that guy and he was dangerous,  but being exposed to and, at times,  responsible for that kind of retribution has to change a person. It's little wonder she became an enraged killbot over Cercei killing one of the only people she *can* actually trust and who she *did* actually save the way she wanted to, but failed, to save so many others.

The Witcher was popular beforehand and Sapkowski was famous but the video games (especially 3) opened the availability of it up to a wider audience by virtue of the games being available in multiple languages.   
  
Looking at Wikipedia, the Witcher novels didn't start getting official releases in English until 2007 - with one that originally released in 1999 going as long as until 2017 without being translated to English.  The original Witcher game also came out in 2007. Therefore, I would say that without the video games the novels might never have been translated officially or it would have been way longer.   
  
So while famous before, this took Sapkowski's (and the Witcher's) fame from a kind of local level to an international/worldwide one. Both the books and the games are super important in this case.

I'm just pointing out how disingenuous it is to say a show that is unknown to the vast majority of people who are fans of either the books or the games, means the books were widely popular in the world at large before the games.

Certainly in the English speaking world few had heard of them, but the Witcher was translated into tons of languages and was popular in other countries like Spain and Germany before the games. Sapkowski even won a prestigious Spanish award for *The Last Wish* in 2003, something that wouldn't have happened if the books were only known in Poland. In fact the English translation was published by Gollancz, a major publisher, before the first game by a few months, and considering how indie the first game is it's unlikely the translation only happened because a game was coming out.

The games only exist because the books were popular in parts of Europe (not just Poland) and they decided to adapt them. Yes, after the success of the games, and then later the Netflix series, the books are even more well known, in America it's undeniable the books were significantly more well known because of the games, but America isn't the whole world.","lumvj41"

The fact that she literally commits more war crimes than almost any other character in the series? We're ignoring everything else in regards to those she killed except that which best helps paint Dany as a paragon of justice?

>!Comparing her actions to Ned carrying out the law and swiftly beheading a Night's Watch deserter, a law he has sworn to uphold, is laughable. Dany makes decisions about who should live and die at her whims, frequently ignoring the counsel of her advisors, and doles out punishment with inconsistent severity. She acts on impulse, on emotion. She acts in the same way that Barristan Selmy describes her father: setting towns and castles ablaze, burning men alive with wildfire, giving his enemies the justice *he* thought they deserved, and each time feeling more powerful and right for having done it.!

So to *actually* recap the people she killed, threatened, or otherwise allowed to die:

* >!Made no objections to Drogo brutally executing her brother by pouring molten gold onto him; waving it off by saying fire can't harm a real dragon.

* >!Tied Duur to Drogo's funeral pyre and burned her alive

* >!Swears vengeance on Qarth for turning her people away, with fire and blood if they do not comply.

* >!Locked Daxos and Doreah in Daxos' vault to slowly die

* >!Burned Pyat Pree to death after he captured her dragons

* >!Burned Kraznys to death after buying the Unsullied

* >!Ordered the Unsullied to kill all the slave masters of Astapor

* >!Parleys with Yunkai to offer ""terms of peace"" and threatened to let Drogon kill the emissary despite swearing safe conduct.

* >!Crucifies 163 slavers in Mereen - we later learn she does this with little consideration to who is crucified, as one of the crucified had opposed the slaver's decision to crucify slaves as a warning to her

* >!Orders Daario to kill every Wise Master in Yunkai, then amends the order to take a former Mereenese slaver with him and offer the Yunkai Masters the choice of living in her world or dying in theirs. She only amends her order after Jorah urges her to, reminding her that he would be dead if Ned Stark had acted like her.

* >!Ordered the execution of the freed slave Mossador for killing a slaver

* >!Has one of the leaders of Mereen set on fire, ripped apart, and eaten by her dragons. She purposely does this in front of the leaders, threatening them with the same gruesome fate

* >!Traps the Khali in their temple and burns it to the ground.

* >!When the cities of Slaver's Bay revolt and attack Mereen, she tells Tyrion that her plan  ""I will crucify the masters, I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt.""

* >!She parleys with Yunkai, Volantis, and Astapor's emissaries under the guise of surrender only to launch an attack having her dragon's burn a ship and it's crew to ash, likely boiling many alive in the water and having two of the 3 emissaries executed (which, hey, at least this one was a swift death instead of her usual methods)

* >!Accuses Tyrion of plotting against her to protect his family when Cersei outsmarts him, threatening to fly to the Red Keep and burn it to the ground.

* >!After leading the charge against Jaime and the Tarly's (which obviously involved more burning people alive, and her Dothraki hunting down and slaughtering fleeing soldiers) she rounded up the survivors and gave the ultimatum: bend the knee or get roasted alive, she will take no prisoners.

* >!When Tyrion tells her Cersei rules by fear, Daenery's notes her father accomplished a lot through fear, as if to justify her own past and future use of it. 

>!All that before season 8's supposed ""surprise"" descent into madness. And that doesn't really address how often she fragrantly ignores her advisors, lets her emotions lead her, goes back on her word, and otherwise demonstrates how generally unhinged she's been from the beginning. To name a few:

* >!Choosing to Banish Jorah for his betrayal rather than execute him like she would for almost anyone else.

* >!Banishing Jorah a 2nd time instead of executing him like she said she would when he defies his banishment and returns to Mereen

* >!Temporarily abandons her campaign in Westeros to fly north of the wall and save Jon against her advisor's counsel and her own decree that she could not fight in the north or Cersei would win.

And you can very easily look at the people whom she killed and comprehend their point of view.

>!Duur did what she did to get revenge against the man leading the barbarians that raped her and other women numerous times, burned down her temple, slaughtered her people. Even after Dany ""saved"" her, she was still a slave in all but name. Dany even promised to ""free"" her if she used blood magic to save Drogo. She told Dany it would cost a life to revive Drogo, Dany chose not to question it further, and didn't deny it after the fact when Duur said she had been warned, that she knew the price was her son's life.

>!Doreah grew up a sex slave, she had to learn to fend for herself as best she could. She was bought by Viserys as a gift to Dany. Even if Dany treated her well, she was forced into that position. Dany even tasked her with whoring herself to seduce the men in Qarth. At this point Dany has next to nothing, they were on the verge of dying in the desert. She saw an opportunity in allying herself with Daxos, and for that Dany sentenced her to a brutal death.

>!Daxos owed no allegiance to Dany. She threatened to burn the city to the ground for refusing her. He could have let the cities decision stand, and let her die in the desert, but he decided to take a chance. He makes her a guest, giving her food, water, shelter, gifts, etc. He offered an alliance through marriage, and she declines and goes to the other leaders of Qarth, who are basically his rivals, for support. So he turns to the warlocks with a new plan to help them get the dragons in exchange for becoming king of Qarth

>!Obviously the slavers are horrible and they deserve judgement. The only points worth making are that 1: it was their way of life, and Dany was mercilessly upending that with little attention to the logistics of overhauling a society like that, freeing the slaves abruptly through violence caused numerous problems. And 2: she repeatedly resorted to barbaric ""eye for an eye"" levels of punishment.!","lutlnhd"

It's true that the books were popular. They received a good translation and there was quite a lot of hype around them. However (and this is a big however), they were popular only within the context of the sf&f fandom, which, unfortunately, is rather small here. It was not a book that had broken into the mainstream like Game of Thrones or the Harry Potter books.

That prestigious award you mention is the Ignotus, the Spanish equivalent of the Hugo. Which, again shows that the books were popular within the fandom. But, again, the Spanish fandom is a small world. You wouldn't mention the Ignotus to a random person here and expect them to know what you are talking about.

The sad truth about the sf&f market here is that we cannot support professional writers in the genre. The successful ones often move on to historical novels or YA fiction, or the like, which gives them a chance to live from their writing.","lumz7qv"

But when you at nose in the air about it? Well. You do you. But I do think Rowling might know a bit more than you and I about writing successful fiction. And maybe it's because it didn't try and be some pseudo intellectual bullshit.

Or maybe that's just me. ","lupo7vy"

I suppose it is inevitable that a build up lasting several decades should be hard to live up to. I've no real complaints because at least he made the effort to finish it and, tbh, now I'm thinking about it again, he did do a pretty good job. (I actually really loved the self insert and the parts with Roland in the corporate building that protects the flower... The more I'm thinking about it, it was great...love Stephen King)","luodz8x"

I’m aware, but I was under the (perhaps mistaken) impression that Abraham is friendly with GRRM as well.

Brandon Sanderson was not Robert Jordan’s assistant, but he ended up finishing WoT - I was expressing my opinion about Abraham as a fantasy writer capable of finishing ASoIaF. Having been a writing assistant or not has no bearing on my opinion, you can stop trying to correct me now.","lure4tp"

I don't know why you're so dead-set on fighting about the book's popularity. I never said no one ever read them ever prior to the games. But the games increased their popularity by an *incredible* degree. They would not be anywhere close to as relevant now without the games. 
The games were the single best thing to happen to The Witcher, and by extention to Sapkowski, at least monetarily speaking.

Oh my god, I just realized something. Are you Sapkowski?? Who else would be so adamant that the games had no effect on the book's popularity?? Why would anyone else want to believe the lies except the guy who lost his damn mind that someone could like the games more than the books??","lumz593"

In college I studied critical theory and creative writing. I know from experience writing a book is much harder than critiquing one. Ive never finished a novel, if I wrote a “bad” one I would be proud of it regardless.

There is also a slew of “low quality” media I either simply enjoy, or is dear to my heart from nostalgia. And as a bisexual man who grew up in Appalachian in the 90s and early 2000s, I very much enjoyed reading about the wizard boy forced to live in a closet when I was a child.","luq65ts"
