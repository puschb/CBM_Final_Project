"1gxa0r3","The differences in bookish communities on IG/TikTok/X/Reddit","I love the bookish community and have observed some key differences in it on different platforms, so thought I'd share about my experience here.

I have been a lifelong reader, but only discovered the online bookish community during the pandemic. It started with bookstagram. Unbeknownst to me, there was a whole subculture on Instagram of people reading books and posting about them, sharing book recs as well as beautiful photos of books. I eagerly set up my own bookstagram account in January 2021 and quickly got connected with many other book lovers.

I was blown away by the depth of relationships I could form with people far away because we shared such similar interests. It was like finding my people, well into my 30s. I even met bookstagrammers in my same city that became some of my best friends in real life. I can honestly say that joining bookstagram changed my life!

I‚Äôve since joined the bookish community on other platforms: TikTok and Threads, with some experience on Twitter/X as well as now here on Reddit. I think they each have their own advantages and different emphases, so I thought I‚Äôd lay out my observations here.

**Instagram:**

The #bookstagram community is really robust, with many people involved for many years. I think it‚Äôs easiest to form a strong community here, with DM groups and buddy reads happening a lot. There‚Äôs a big emphasis on book reviews and beautiful pictures, but not quite as much as in the past because the algorithm is prioritizing video content over static photos.

**TikTok:**

There‚Äôs a big #BookTok community, but I think it‚Äôs harder to connect in an authentic way with other book lovers here because of the lack of messaging options (no group chats). The algorithm is fantastic though at helping you find readers who share your interest and it‚Äôs fantastic for finding book recs. The community seems to focus a lot on romance and fantasy, with spicy reads or dramatic action getting a lot of promotion (or maybe that‚Äôs just my own algorithm?)

**Threads/X/BlueSky:**

I‚Äôm lumping these together because of their similar formats. These are great platforms for authors to be on to promote their books and connect with other authors. There‚Äôs a robust reader community too, with an emphasis on book news and drama rather than individual book recs.

**Reddit:**

This is the place to come for info about anything and everything related to books. From really niche book recs to bookish awards or anything in between, the amount of searchable info is amazing. The book community here seems a bit more isolated, though, coming here more for specific questions and needs rather than trying to develop lasting relationships with individuals.

I‚Äôm fairly new to the bookish Reddit community though ‚Äì so please correct me on anything I‚Äôve gotten wrong!

Do you think I‚Äôve got the right read on each of the different communities? Anywhere I‚Äôm not looking for bookish community that I should be?

"1gwxkli","Why Lonesome Dove Deserves its Legendary Reputation","Sometimes, a book's reputation precedes it so much that you wonder if it can ever live up to the hype. For me,¬†*Lonesome Dove* not only lived up to my expectations‚Äîit far exceeded them.

I bought the book ages ago but kept putting off reading it. Finally, after finishing *All the Pretty Horses* for the second time, I decided to dive in. I was on a serious Western kick, but I worried *Lonesome Dove* might feel lesser by comparison. I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong. The two books are incomparable. While they both fall under the Western genre, comparing them feels like a disservice. They're just too different.

This book is a true epic, and I mean that in every sense of the word. It gave me the same sweeping, awe-inspiring feelings I had while reading Ken Follett‚Äôs *The Pillars of the Earth* and *World Without End*. The scale is immense, the storytelling masterful, and the world so vivid it feels like you‚Äôre travelling every dusty mile alongside the characters.

# The Writing: Breathtaking in Its Simplicity

Larry McMurtry‚Äôs writing style is completely different from, say, Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs flawless in its way. Where McCarthy leans toward sparse, poetic prose, McMurtry crafts vivid, almost painterly scenes. His descriptions are breathtaking and memorable.

Some images from the book have lodged themselves firmly in my mind. One of my favourites is the old hermit with his mounds of buffalo bones‚Äîa haunting symbol of changing times. Another unforgettable scene is the cattle in a St. Elmo‚Äôs firestorm, their horns lit by lightning as they journey north. McMurtry‚Äôs ability to capture such moments in stunning detail is one of the book‚Äôs greatest strengths.

# The Characters: Perfectly Realized

The cast of characters in *Lonesome Dove* is nothing short of perfection. Despite its sprawling narrative and large ensemble, every character‚Äîmajor or minor‚Äîfeels fully realized. Their drives, struggles, and triumphs are so authentic that they practically leap off the page.

What I found remarkable is how McMurtry makes you care equally for each storyline. Every character is flawed but layered with unique, redeeming qualities that make them unforgettable. It‚Äôs this balance of humanity and imperfection that brings the story to life.

# A Story Both Dark and Romanticized

*Lonesome Dove* captures the stark reality of life in the Old West while romanticizing it just enough to feel timeless. The danger is palpable‚Äîdeath seems to lurk around every corner of the journey from Texas to Montana. And yet, there‚Äôs also an undeniable beauty to McMurtry‚Äôs vision of the West: a land of endless peace and sparse grandeur, where the hardships only heighten the triumphs.

It‚Äôs a tragic story in many ways, marking the end of an era and the fading of the Old West as an idea and ideology. The tone is dark but not overwhelmingly so, always grounded in a sense of truth.

# Why You Should Read Lonesome Dove

If you‚Äôre hesitating because of the book‚Äôs length, don‚Äôt. The journey is absolutely worth it. McMurtry keeps the story fresh with changing scenery, a steady pace, and characters who draw you in completely.

I understand now why *Lonesome Dove* won the Pulitzer Prize and is so highly regarded. It‚Äôs beautiful, heartbreaking, and satisfying from start to finish. It‚Äôs an unforgettable journey with expertly crafted characters, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget it.

# Where to Go From Here

This was my first Larry McMurtry book, but it certainly won‚Äôt be my last. How do his other books compare? I know there are other books in the *Lonesome Dove* series, but I‚Äôm also curious about his other works. If you‚Äôve read anything else by McMurtry, what would you recommend? Are his other novels as good as this one? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

For now, I might take a short break from traditional Westerns, though I recently started *Outer Dark* by McCarthy. While it‚Äôs not a Western in the traditional sense, it has a rugged, frontier-like atmosphere and a dark, haunting quality that fits the genre in its own way. But Larry McMurtry has definitely got my attention.

# Final Thoughts

In short, *Lonesome Dove* is epic beyond belief. I wish there were a better way to describe it, but that‚Äôs truly the best word: *epic*. If you haven‚Äôt read it, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. It‚Äôs a time investment, but one that pays off in every way. This is a book that will stay with me forever, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier to have finally read it.

"1gw4vte","Why I feel lost reading the later dune books","Spoilers for the series up to maybe 50% of god emperor of dune

Also remember that this is just my opinion. You are allowed to enjoy the books and there is nothing wrong with it. This is just my experience. 

1. dune goes through many accepting periods throughout the series. There are events that take place that make you say ‚Äúwhy????‚Äù But you just have to accept them if you want to enjoy the story that comes next. It happens with Paul dying, with Leto fusing with the sand trout, and Leto fusing with the worm. I sometimes fall into this camp. I just wonder, ‚Äúfrom a writing perspective, when frank herbert sat down to write the book, what made him think turning the main character into a worm is a good idea?‚Äù 

2. This is sort of similar to my previous point but anything after dune messiah is so unexpected that it just feels out of place. If the events that in any other story, I think most people would be fine, but because it happened in dune, it can be a little jarring. I gave a similar example in a previous post. I think it fits in terms of plot but just in the feel of it. I apologize for it being crude. Imagine you‚Äôre watching a movie about a bullfighter. The whole movie, you watch the bullfighter struggle against the bull. But he sucks at his job. Audiences are getting bored. So one day, the bullfighter decides he must undergo physical changes to fight the bull. But instead of taking steroids or something like that, he shoots bull sperm into his veins and turns into a bull human hybrid that the crowd loves. That is what it‚Äôs like essentially when jumping from dune messiah to children of dune and god emperor. 

3. the stakes drastically decrease. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the larger stakes in the context of the story are huge. But the moment to moment stakes feel so redundant. It goes from ‚Äúour entire family is being attacked and we are stranded on a desert planet. How will we survive?‚Äù To ‚Äúour worm god is getting attacked by random thugs so the best army in the world has to kill these very unskilled fighters. Will they accomplish it?‚Äù

4. Unnecessary plot threads. So many plot threads get dropped between books that you wonder why they were even included. Farad‚Äôn had no impact on the story. And him getting BG training is even more useless since he doesn‚Äôt even use it and isn‚Äôt in the next book. The whole thing with jacurutu existing. Why does this random outpost of bandits matter? What makes jacurutu specifically matter? When Leto goes through the spice trance, why is harum so important? Why is he even included if he‚Äôs only mentioned once or twice in throwaway lines but somehow has the importance of a possession? It feels irritating reading 500 pages and 200 of those are just unnecessary things you will never see again or had any impact on the story. 

5. The characters make dumb decisions. Wensicia really thought in children of dune that she could kill the two children of the most revered emperor in mankind‚Äôs history, who also had the power to see the future, with two tigers. And that is what half of the book revolves around. 

6. the dialogue just tanks in quality with each book. In book one, it was clunky at best. In messiah, it was an irritation. In children it was unintelligible. And it gets better in god emperor but it is still probably some of the stiffest dialogue out there. 

Also the fact that there‚Äôs a long homophobic rant in god emperor about how if an army is composed of all men, they will turn gay then turn into rapists when they leave the military ","2024-11-21 01:55:09 UTC",125
"1gw3qpe","Any interesting experiences reading books in public?","Any experiences with reading books yourself or your reaction to other people in public places, like restaurants, the bus, library, etc.?

One time in a crowded bus I saw this young lady reading the same book I was reading, a Cormac McCarthy novel. I was in the bus standing and she was sitting. I have a hard time speaking to strangers but pushed through the anxiety and said, Sorry to bother you, I just noticed we're both reading the same book, do you like it?

She looked at me as if I had asked her the most intrusive question in the world, and just got up and went by the door and got off the next stop, never looking back. I was shaken up for a while, looking at people around who were looking back at me, all confused.

Another time I was reading a book in a restaurant a while back and an old man who was sitting on a nearby table from me suddenly bent over and elbowed me and said, with his mouth full of burger, What is the catch?

I was like, Huh?

He repeated his point. It took me a while to realize he was joking around, since the book I was reading was Catch-22. I laughed. He had nothing else to say and went back to wolfing down his food.","2024-11-21 01:01:45 UTC",508

"1gtstm8","Thoughts on the ""It Was All A Dream"" Twist?","I recently finished a book series (for anyone who is curious, it's the >!Pegasus series by Kate O'Hearn!<), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though it's technically geared towards children (and I'm in graduate school), I loved the characters and the way the author combined the real world with Roman mythology. Now, the series consists of six books, and there were so many instances where I had to force myself to stop and get some sleep because I had been glued to the pages. In other words, **I was completely lost in the world the author had built**...and then, I get to the last couple of chapters in the final book. The second-to-last chapter *ends* with what easily *could* be the main character's death.

Now, while I would have been sad if the main character had died, it would have honestly been preferable to the way the last chapter *starts* \\- with the main character's *waking up and finding herself in her apartment as if the entire series hadn't actually happened*! Her internal thoughts are *all about the dream she just had but couldn't quite remember*! I read that and was just TICKED OFF - thinking ""was this *entire* series **really just a dream the main character had**!?"" Granted, it is quickly revealed that the main character is only having this ""twist"" dream sequence because she is essentially in a kind of limbo between life and death. The chapter (and the series) ends with her *actually* waking up, seeing her closest friend (the one she made in the first book and **the one who kickstarted the adventures**), and feeling excited for any adventures to come.

Even though this series ***thankfully*** didn't follow through with the ""it was all a dream"" twist, my reaction to the fact that it was **teased in the first place** made me realize *just how much I hate this kind of twist*. It just feels like a huge let-down after spending so much time with fun characters and an amazing world. Now, because the ""twist"" wasn't really a twist, I will not be surprised if I find myself reading this series again. However, if the series really had been a dream for the main character, I don't think I'd be able to pick up the series again.

What about y'all? Whenever a series ends with ""it was all a dream"" (or something to that effect), how do y'all feel?","2024-11-18 01:04:52 UTC",356

"1gtham5","Noam Chomsky Has Been Proved Right ‚Ä¢ The writer‚Äôs new argument for left-wing foreign policy has earned a mainstream hearing. (Book review ""The Myth of American Idealism"")","For more than half a century, Noam Chomsky has been arguably the world‚Äôs most persistent, uncompromising, and intellectually respected critic of contemporary U.S. foreign policy,  seeking to expose Washington‚Äôs costly and inhumane approach to the rest of the world, an approach he believes has harmed millions and is contrary to the United States‚Äô professed values. As co-author Nathan J. Robinson writes in the preface, **The Myth of American Idealism** was written to ‚Äúdraw insights from across [Chomsky‚Äôs] body of work into a single volume that could introduce people to his central critiques of U.S. foreign policy.‚Äù It accomplishes that task admirably.

The central target of the book is the claim that U.S. foreign policy is guided by the lofty ideals of democracy, freedom, the rule of law, human rights, etc. For those who subscribe to this view, the damage the United States has sometimes inflicted on other countries was the unintended and much regretted result of actions taken for noble purposes and with the best of intentions. 

For Chomsky and Robinson, these claims are nonsense. Not only did the young American republic fulfill its Manifest Destiny by waging a genocidal campaign against the indigenous population, but it has since backed a bevy of brutal dictatorships, intervened to thwart democratic processes in many countries, and waged or backed wars that killed millions of people in Indochina, Latin America, and the Middle East, all while falsely claiming to be defending freedom, democracy, human rights, and other cherished ideals. U.S. officials are quick to condemn others when they violate international law, but they refuse to join the International Criminal Court, the Law of the Sea Treaty, and many other global conventions. Nor do they hesitate to violate the United Nations Charter themselves.

The record of hypocrisy recounted by Chomsky and Robinson is sobering and convincing. No open-minded reader could absorb this book and continue to believe the pious rationales that U.S. leaders invoke to justify their bare-knuckled actions.

The book is less persuasive when it tries to explain why U.S. officials act this way.  Chomsky and Robinson argue that U.S. foreign policy is largely the servant of corporate interests‚Äîthe military-industrial complex, energy companies, and ‚Äúmajor corporations, banks, investment firms. The picture is more complicated than they suggest. For starters, when corporate profits and national security interests clash, the former often lose out. Also, other great powers have acted in much the same way, inventing their own elaborate moral justifications. This behavior preceded the emergence of modern corporate capitalism.

Why do Americans tolerate policies that are costly, often unsuccessful, and morally horrendous? Their answer, which is generally persuasive, is twofold.  First, ordinary citizens lack the political mechanisms to shape policy. Second, government institutions work overtime to ‚Äúmanufacture consent‚Äù by classifying information, prosecuting leakers, lying to the public, and refusing to be held accountable. [Having written about these phenomena myself](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250234810/thehellofgoodintentions), I found their portrait of how the foreign-policy establishment purveys and defends its world view to be broadly accurate.

Despite some reservations, **The Myth of American Idealism** is a valuable work that provides an able introduction to Chomsky‚Äôs thinking. Indeed, if I were asked whether a student would learn more about U.S. foreign policy by reading this book or by reading a collection of the essays that current and former U.S. officials occasionally write in journals such as Foreign Affairs or the Atlantic, Chomsky and Robinson would win hands down.

I wouldn‚Äôt have written that last sentence when I began my career 40 years ago. I‚Äôve been paying attention, however, and my thinking has evolved as the evidence has piled up. It is regrettable but revealing that a perspective on U.S. foreign policy once confined to the margins of left-wing discourse in the United States is now more credible than the shopworn platitudes that many senior U.S. officials rely on to defend their actions.

Over the last several weeks/months we've all seen an uptick in articles about schools/towns/states banning books from classrooms and libraries. Obviously, this is an important subject that many of us feel passionate about but unfortunately it has a tendency to come in waves and drown out any other discussion. We obviously don't want to ban this discussion but we also want to allow other posts some air to breathe. In order to accomplish this, we're going to post a discussion thread every month to allow users to post articles and discuss them. In addition, our friends at /r/bannedbooks would love for you to check out their sub and discuss banned books there as well.","2024-11-16 17:00:27 UTC",124
"1gsq5si","What are some ways, even if childish, that you tried to be like characters in a book you loved?","When I was little, I really liked superhero comics so I often tried to dress like them or act like them. I think this desire to be like characters I admired or liked very much never quite left me. It just evolved and took new forms that were perhaps felt more mature but weren't really.

When I read The Outsiders, and later saw the movie, I put grease in my hair and wore leather jackets and just tried to act tough. I'm sure I wasn't the only one. I mean the movie had Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze....they defined cool and so everybody wanted to be like them.

The Count of Monte Cristo was a whole other story. I don't think I quite understood the narrative but it drove my imagination crazy. There was a girl in my class named Mercedes, and I had all these wild fantasies of finding treasure behind the school and getting my revenge. There was actually this mysterious well that remained uncovered and smelled of piss and gasoline, and my treasure was supposedly was at the bottom of it. Once I were to find it, then I would prepare to get my revenge on her boyfriend, a football player who was actually a nice guy. My only problem was me trying to change my voice and appearance. I found a wig and a fake mustache but didn't seem to really do much. So I gave up. And never did climb down that mysterious well to find my gold.

I was reminded of this today when I saw a thread on The Count of Monte Cristo, so I thought why the hell not, I'll embarrass myself and hope others will share a few embarrassing stories of their own. :)","2024-11-16 15:53:17 UTC",245

"1gr3l07","A religious person‚Äôs thoughts on The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale","I want to preface this by saying that this review is based on my own thoughts and experiences and do not reflect those of every Christian. I just made this post because being familiar with the Bible gives the book a whole other layer which I found interesting. 

So I went into this book completely blind without reading any reviews or discussions on it. I had heard of The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale before but literally did not know anything about it‚Ä¶which is surprising considering how popular the book is. Because of this, I was so lost until like the first quarter of the book when things had began to unfold. Once I got the hang of what was going on, I was shook. I loved Atwood‚Äôs use of non-linear storytelling. Although this made it difficult to follow the story at some point, I still think it was such a great way to keep the suspense and interest throughout the book. 

I was shocked at how real the book is. This book was written decades ago but still related to today‚Äôs decade in so many ways it‚Äôs scary. Although the chances of our world being thrown into a totalitarian government are slightly lower, it‚Äôs scary how (somewhat easy it will be). The book was able to capture that sentiment quite well. 

Now on to my thoughts about the book from a religious perspective. I consider the book a very good critique of Christian nationalism. From Wikipedia *‚ÄúChristian nationalism is a form of religious nationalism that focuses on promoting the Christian views of its followers in order to achieve prominence or dominance in political and social life‚Äù*   In simple terms, using the Bible and God to gain power over others. This occurred in Europe in the Middle Ages and even today there are quite a number of countries that still follow the ideologies of Christian nationalism. The portrayal of this ideology in the book is so spot on. One way is the use of biblical verses to reinforce certain ideas. In the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, certain bible verses are repeated over and over during certain events that they are entrained in the people‚Äôs subconscious minds. You see it a lot in the main character because although she is not a believer, at some point, she becomes influenced. 

Another way that Christian nationalist is portrayed in The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale is also the gatekeeping of the Bible or even any information in general. Bible‚Äôs are kept locked up and only opened during certain events for specific people to read. This is similar to what the Catholic church enforced during the Middle Ages where only priests had access to the Bible and the Bible could only be read in Latin. What this creates is that the people in power are able to bend the rules to their will‚Ä¶This is what we see in the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale where people in power are able to take certain liberties their subsidiaries cannot

I loved this book so much because of how spot on it is in showing how societies an easily be shaped to conform to certain ideologies especially by keeping people in ignorance. I hear it has been banned in certain schools in the States, which is so ironic considering the contents of the book. Reading the book as someone who has a bit of Bible knowledge was so interesting because I noticed how certain verses were taken out of context or tweaked to fit the oppressor‚Äôs narrative. The oppressors did not even have to change or uphaul much of the words in the Bible, but by keeping people in ignorance and constant indoctrination, a totalitarian state was created where people would not question anything. I rate this book an easy 4.3/5 stars. I regret waiting so long to read it.

"1gr0sbn","Just feel frustrated with people who think fiction (as opposed to nonfiction) is a waste of time. ","Had a bit of a debate with someone online about fiction vs. nonfiction. It came out of nowhere. The guy was talking about reading a certain president's memoir, then suddenly changed topics and said the following (paraphrasing a bit to leave us the swear words): ""I used to read fiction when I was younger but then I grew up and realized that it's time to step out of fantasy and into reality.""

He was a history buff and felt history is the ultimate nonfiction and that many of our world's problems was that young kids were sucked into fiction (he especially hated fantasy books) and know nothing about history, then grow up and repeat past's mistakes.

I ended the debate because I knew fiction matters yet was unable to defend my position, unable to explain what made fiction important. I could only say we as human beings are storytellers and that stories have been a part of our lives since the beginning. His sarcastic response was if I had read that in a nonfiction book.

Obviously he is not the only person who feels that way about nonfiction. I've come across this view before, although it comes in various flavors and different justifications. My problem is with the black-and-white nature of it. He constantly made it seem as if I was anti-nonfiction. You can value both fiction and nonfiction, can't you? And can criticize both as well. It's totally fine to say certain book of fiction is awful or a waste of time, but why go and label all of them so? I mean this guy was college educated and smart, so how could he think that way?","2024-11-14 09:04:21 UTC",563

"1gq8wrp","What are the most unforgettable child-parent relationship from a book you've read, whether fiction or non-fiction?","I've often wondered to what extent a big part of the appeal of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird for me is about justice in face of racial prejudice, which I think is very important theme. Or the trial, which is the reason I wanted to read it (I'm interested in legal dramas). Or it if has something to do with the relationship between father and his young daughter, Scout (the narrator).

Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is a widow who does an outstanding job not only as a lawyer but also as a father. He has great compassion, wisdom, and a strong sense of moral that he has tried to also instill in his kids. As you read the book, you see him again and again teach his kids that you gotta be brave and do the right thing even if almost the whole town is against you.

I quite enjoyed the relationship between Scout and her dad and starting to think that has been a big reason the book holds a special place for me. And wonder if there are other parent-child relationships that well-read posters like yourself found memorable from your readings?

To be clear, they don't have to fictional or positive. Terrible relationships are sometimes even harder to forget. So please share any such relationships you recall vividly, and if you can, say what it was about the relationship that you found unique or memorable.","2024-11-13 09:13:09 UTC",255
"1gq5czz","‚ÄúMaus‚Äù in the modern era ","I finally had the chance to read *Maus*, a book I‚Äôd been meaning to pick up for years but kept putting off. I didn‚Äôt choose it specifically with the American election in mind, but reading it now felt coincidentally relevant. One thing that stands out across the book‚Äîand in much of WWII history‚Äîis that Hitler‚Äôs horrific actions didn‚Äôt start overnight; the Nazi rise was a gradual, chilling progression. Vladek‚Äôs story captures this slow build-up, where the early, smaller aggressions against Jews steadily grow, culminating in the full horror of the Holocaust.

I‚Äôm not saying the future of American government will mirror the events in Austria, Poland, and elsewhere under the Nazi regime because I don't want to diminish the severity of those times. But history has a way of repeating itself, and I want to stay aware of unsettling patterns we might see emerging.","2024-11-13 05:02:29 UTC",188

"1gxa0r3","The differences in bookish communities on IG/TikTok/X/Reddit","I love the bookish community and have observed some key differences in it on different platforms, so thought I'd share about my experience here.

I have been a lifelong reader, but only discovered the online bookish community during the pandemic. It started with bookstagram. Unbeknownst to me, there was a whole subculture on Instagram of people reading books and posting about them, sharing book recs as well as beautiful photos of books. I eagerly set up my own bookstagram account in January 2021 and quickly got connected with many other book lovers.

I was blown away by the depth of relationships I could form with people far away because we shared such similar interests. It was like finding my people, well into my 30s. I even met bookstagrammers in my same city that became some of my best friends in real life. I can honestly say that joining bookstagram changed my life!

I‚Äôve since joined the bookish community on other platforms: TikTok and Threads, with some experience on Twitter/X as well as now here on Reddit. I think they each have their own advantages and different emphases, so I thought I‚Äôd lay out my observations here.

**Instagram:**

The #bookstagram community is really robust, with many people involved for many years. I think it‚Äôs easiest to form a strong community here, with DM groups and buddy reads happening a lot. There‚Äôs a big emphasis on book reviews and beautiful pictures, but not quite as much as in the past because the algorithm is prioritizing video content over static photos.

**TikTok:**

There‚Äôs a big #BookTok community, but I think it‚Äôs harder to connect in an authentic way with other book lovers here because of the lack of messaging options (no group chats). The algorithm is fantastic though at helping you find readers who share your interest and it‚Äôs fantastic for finding book recs. The community seems to focus a lot on romance and fantasy, with spicy reads or dramatic action getting a lot of promotion (or maybe that‚Äôs just my own algorithm?)

**Threads/X/BlueSky:**

I‚Äôm lumping these together because of their similar formats. These are great platforms for authors to be on to promote their books and connect with other authors. There‚Äôs a robust reader community too, with an emphasis on book news and drama rather than individual book recs.

**Reddit:**

This is the place to come for info about anything and everything related to books. From really niche book recs to bookish awards or anything in between, the amount of searchable info is amazing. The book community here seems a bit more isolated, though, coming here more for specific questions and needs rather than trying to develop lasting relationships with individuals.

I‚Äôm fairly new to the bookish Reddit community though ‚Äì so please correct me on anything I‚Äôve gotten wrong!

Do you think I‚Äôve got the right read on each of the different communities? Anywhere I‚Äôm not looking for bookish community that I should be?

"1gwxkli","Why Lonesome Dove Deserves its Legendary Reputation","Sometimes, a book's reputation precedes it so much that you wonder if it can ever live up to the hype. For me,¬†*Lonesome Dove* not only lived up to my expectations‚Äîit far exceeded them.

I bought the book ages ago but kept putting off reading it. Finally, after finishing *All the Pretty Horses* for the second time, I decided to dive in. I was on a serious Western kick, but I worried *Lonesome Dove* might feel lesser by comparison. I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong. The two books are incomparable. While they both fall under the Western genre, comparing them feels like a disservice. They're just too different.

This book is a true epic, and I mean that in every sense of the word. It gave me the same sweeping, awe-inspiring feelings I had while reading Ken Follett‚Äôs *The Pillars of the Earth* and *World Without End*. The scale is immense, the storytelling masterful, and the world so vivid it feels like you‚Äôre travelling every dusty mile alongside the characters.

# The Writing: Breathtaking in Its Simplicity

Larry McMurtry‚Äôs writing style is completely different from, say, Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs flawless in its way. Where McCarthy leans toward sparse, poetic prose, McMurtry crafts vivid, almost painterly scenes. His descriptions are breathtaking and memorable.

Some images from the book have lodged themselves firmly in my mind. One of my favourites is the old hermit with his mounds of buffalo bones‚Äîa haunting symbol of changing times. Another unforgettable scene is the cattle in a St. Elmo‚Äôs firestorm, their horns lit by lightning as they journey north. McMurtry‚Äôs ability to capture such moments in stunning detail is one of the book‚Äôs greatest strengths.

# The Characters: Perfectly Realized

The cast of characters in *Lonesome Dove* is nothing short of perfection. Despite its sprawling narrative and large ensemble, every character‚Äîmajor or minor‚Äîfeels fully realized. Their drives, struggles, and triumphs are so authentic that they practically leap off the page.

What I found remarkable is how McMurtry makes you care equally for each storyline. Every character is flawed but layered with unique, redeeming qualities that make them unforgettable. It‚Äôs this balance of humanity and imperfection that brings the story to life.

# A Story Both Dark and Romanticized

*Lonesome Dove* captures the stark reality of life in the Old West while romanticizing it just enough to feel timeless. The danger is palpable‚Äîdeath seems to lurk around every corner of the journey from Texas to Montana. And yet, there‚Äôs also an undeniable beauty to McMurtry‚Äôs vision of the West: a land of endless peace and sparse grandeur, where the hardships only heighten the triumphs.

It‚Äôs a tragic story in many ways, marking the end of an era and the fading of the Old West as an idea and ideology. The tone is dark but not overwhelmingly so, always grounded in a sense of truth.

# Why You Should Read Lonesome Dove

If you‚Äôre hesitating because of the book‚Äôs length, don‚Äôt. The journey is absolutely worth it. McMurtry keeps the story fresh with changing scenery, a steady pace, and characters who draw you in completely.

I understand now why *Lonesome Dove* won the Pulitzer Prize and is so highly regarded. It‚Äôs beautiful, heartbreaking, and satisfying from start to finish. It‚Äôs an unforgettable journey with expertly crafted characters, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget it.

# Where to Go From Here

This was my first Larry McMurtry book, but it certainly won‚Äôt be my last. How do his other books compare? I know there are other books in the *Lonesome Dove* series, but I‚Äôm also curious about his other works. If you‚Äôve read anything else by McMurtry, what would you recommend? Are his other novels as good as this one? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

For now, I might take a short break from traditional Westerns, though I recently started *Outer Dark* by McCarthy. While it‚Äôs not a Western in the traditional sense, it has a rugged, frontier-like atmosphere and a dark, haunting quality that fits the genre in its own way. But Larry McMurtry has definitely got my attention.

# Final Thoughts

In short, *Lonesome Dove* is epic beyond belief. I wish there were a better way to describe it, but that‚Äôs truly the best word: *epic*. If you haven‚Äôt read it, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. It‚Äôs a time investment, but one that pays off in every way. This is a book that will stay with me forever, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier to have finally read it.

"1gw4vte","Why I feel lost reading the later dune books","Spoilers for the series up to maybe 50% of god emperor of dune

Also remember that this is just my opinion. You are allowed to enjoy the books and there is nothing wrong with it. This is just my experience. 

1. dune goes through many accepting periods throughout the series. There are events that take place that make you say ‚Äúwhy????‚Äù But you just have to accept them if you want to enjoy the story that comes next. It happens with Paul dying, with Leto fusing with the sand trout, and Leto fusing with the worm. I sometimes fall into this camp. I just wonder, ‚Äúfrom a writing perspective, when frank herbert sat down to write the book, what made him think turning the main character into a worm is a good idea?‚Äù 

2. This is sort of similar to my previous point but anything after dune messiah is so unexpected that it just feels out of place. If the events that in any other story, I think most people would be fine, but because it happened in dune, it can be a little jarring. I gave a similar example in a previous post. I think it fits in terms of plot but just in the feel of it. I apologize for it being crude. Imagine you‚Äôre watching a movie about a bullfighter. The whole movie, you watch the bullfighter struggle against the bull. But he sucks at his job. Audiences are getting bored. So one day, the bullfighter decides he must undergo physical changes to fight the bull. But instead of taking steroids or something like that, he shoots bull sperm into his veins and turns into a bull human hybrid that the crowd loves. That is what it‚Äôs like essentially when jumping from dune messiah to children of dune and god emperor. 

3. the stakes drastically decrease. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the larger stakes in the context of the story are huge. But the moment to moment stakes feel so redundant. It goes from ‚Äúour entire family is being attacked and we are stranded on a desert planet. How will we survive?‚Äù To ‚Äúour worm god is getting attacked by random thugs so the best army in the world has to kill these very unskilled fighters. Will they accomplish it?‚Äù

4. Unnecessary plot threads. So many plot threads get dropped between books that you wonder why they were even included. Farad‚Äôn had no impact on the story. And him getting BG training is even more useless since he doesn‚Äôt even use it and isn‚Äôt in the next book. The whole thing with jacurutu existing. Why does this random outpost of bandits matter? What makes jacurutu specifically matter? When Leto goes through the spice trance, why is harum so important? Why is he even included if he‚Äôs only mentioned once or twice in throwaway lines but somehow has the importance of a possession? It feels irritating reading 500 pages and 200 of those are just unnecessary things you will never see again or had any impact on the story. 

5. The characters make dumb decisions. Wensicia really thought in children of dune that she could kill the two children of the most revered emperor in mankind‚Äôs history, who also had the power to see the future, with two tigers. And that is what half of the book revolves around. 

6. the dialogue just tanks in quality with each book. In book one, it was clunky at best. In messiah, it was an irritation. In children it was unintelligible. And it gets better in god emperor but it is still probably some of the stiffest dialogue out there. 

Also the fact that there‚Äôs a long homophobic rant in god emperor about how if an army is composed of all men, they will turn gay then turn into rapists when they leave the military ","2024-11-21 01:55:09 UTC",125

"1gu3wh2","I don't think I've ever been so blown away by a reveal as I was finishing ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" by Agatha Christie","I just need a place to gush about this. I finished it last night, absolutely floored. I just lie there in bed reeling. I cannot fathom the genius of Agatha Christie. I can't write much without spoiling anything, and this is a book to be read knowing nothing, but I am truly amazed. 

I'm on a mission to read every single Agatha Christie novel. I started with *The Mysterious Affair at Styles* and was instantly hooked.

I know the best selling novelist of all time doesn't need advertising, but seriously, if you love mysteries and crazy twists (that actually make sense) and mysteries you absolutely *can* solve (but probably won't), you owe it to yourself to read Christie.

My only regret is reading her so late in life. I should have been done with her whole canon in my teens or twenties.  

So... for the sake of discussion, and without spoilers, what book had the most impressive reveal moment or twist for you?","2024-11-18 12:47:03 UTC",158

"1gu1hnj","What are some ""Achievement Unlocked"" books?","By which I mean: books where once you've got to the end you feel like you've earned a trophy of sorts, either because of the difficulty, sheer length, or any other reason.

I'm going to suggest the Complete Works Of Shakespeare is an obvious one.

Joyce arguably has at least two. You feel like you've earned one at the end of Ulysses, but then Finnegans Wake still lies ahead as the ultra-hard mode achievement.

What are some other examples you've either achieved or would like to achieve? Are there any you know you'll *never* achieve?

"1gtstm8","Thoughts on the ""It Was All A Dream"" Twist?","I recently finished a book series (for anyone who is curious, it's the >!Pegasus series by Kate O'Hearn!<), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though it's technically geared towards children (and I'm in graduate school), I loved the characters and the way the author combined the real world with Roman mythology. Now, the series consists of six books, and there were so many instances where I had to force myself to stop and get some sleep because I had been glued to the pages. In other words, **I was completely lost in the world the author had built**...and then, I get to the last couple of chapters in the final book. The second-to-last chapter *ends* with what easily *could* be the main character's death.

Now, while I would have been sad if the main character had died, it would have honestly been preferable to the way the last chapter *starts* \\- with the main character's *waking up and finding herself in her apartment as if the entire series hadn't actually happened*! Her internal thoughts are *all about the dream she just had but couldn't quite remember*! I read that and was just TICKED OFF - thinking ""was this *entire* series **really just a dream the main character had**!?"" Granted, it is quickly revealed that the main character is only having this ""twist"" dream sequence because she is essentially in a kind of limbo between life and death. The chapter (and the series) ends with her *actually* waking up, seeing her closest friend (the one she made in the first book and **the one who kickstarted the adventures**), and feeling excited for any adventures to come.

Even though this series ***thankfully*** didn't follow through with the ""it was all a dream"" twist, my reaction to the fact that it was **teased in the first place** made me realize *just how much I hate this kind of twist*. It just feels like a huge let-down after spending so much time with fun characters and an amazing world. Now, because the ""twist"" wasn't really a twist, I will not be surprised if I find myself reading this series again. However, if the series really had been a dream for the main character, I don't think I'd be able to pick up the series again.

What about y'all? Whenever a series ends with ""it was all a dream"" (or something to that effect), how do y'all feel?","2024-11-18 01:04:52 UTC",356

"1gtham5","Noam Chomsky Has Been Proved Right ‚Ä¢ The writer‚Äôs new argument for left-wing foreign policy has earned a mainstream hearing. (Book review ""The Myth of American Idealism"")","For more than half a century, Noam Chomsky has been arguably the world‚Äôs most persistent, uncompromising, and intellectually respected critic of contemporary U.S. foreign policy,  seeking to expose Washington‚Äôs costly and inhumane approach to the rest of the world, an approach he believes has harmed millions and is contrary to the United States‚Äô professed values. As co-author Nathan J. Robinson writes in the preface, **The Myth of American Idealism** was written to ‚Äúdraw insights from across [Chomsky‚Äôs] body of work into a single volume that could introduce people to his central critiques of U.S. foreign policy.‚Äù It accomplishes that task admirably.

The central target of the book is the claim that U.S. foreign policy is guided by the lofty ideals of democracy, freedom, the rule of law, human rights, etc. For those who subscribe to this view, the damage the United States has sometimes inflicted on other countries was the unintended and much regretted result of actions taken for noble purposes and with the best of intentions. 

For Chomsky and Robinson, these claims are nonsense. Not only did the young American republic fulfill its Manifest Destiny by waging a genocidal campaign against the indigenous population, but it has since backed a bevy of brutal dictatorships, intervened to thwart democratic processes in many countries, and waged or backed wars that killed millions of people in Indochina, Latin America, and the Middle East, all while falsely claiming to be defending freedom, democracy, human rights, and other cherished ideals. U.S. officials are quick to condemn others when they violate international law, but they refuse to join the International Criminal Court, the Law of the Sea Treaty, and many other global conventions. Nor do they hesitate to violate the United Nations Charter themselves.

The record of hypocrisy recounted by Chomsky and Robinson is sobering and convincing. No open-minded reader could absorb this book and continue to believe the pious rationales that U.S. leaders invoke to justify their bare-knuckled actions.

The book is less persuasive when it tries to explain why U.S. officials act this way.  Chomsky and Robinson argue that U.S. foreign policy is largely the servant of corporate interests‚Äîthe military-industrial complex, energy companies, and ‚Äúmajor corporations, banks, investment firms. The picture is more complicated than they suggest. For starters, when corporate profits and national security interests clash, the former often lose out. Also, other great powers have acted in much the same way, inventing their own elaborate moral justifications. This behavior preceded the emergence of modern corporate capitalism.

Why do Americans tolerate policies that are costly, often unsuccessful, and morally horrendous? Their answer, which is generally persuasive, is twofold.  First, ordinary citizens lack the political mechanisms to shape policy. Second, government institutions work overtime to ‚Äúmanufacture consent‚Äù by classifying information, prosecuting leakers, lying to the public, and refusing to be held accountable. [Having written about these phenomena myself](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250234810/thehellofgoodintentions), I found their portrait of how the foreign-policy establishment purveys and defends its world view to be broadly accurate.

Despite some reservations, **The Myth of American Idealism** is a valuable work that provides an able introduction to Chomsky‚Äôs thinking. Indeed, if I were asked whether a student would learn more about U.S. foreign policy by reading this book or by reading a collection of the essays that current and former U.S. officials occasionally write in journals such as Foreign Affairs or the Atlantic, Chomsky and Robinson would win hands down.

I wouldn‚Äôt have written that last sentence when I began my career 40 years ago. I‚Äôve been paying attention, however, and my thinking has evolved as the evidence has piled up. It is regrettable but revealing that a perspective on U.S. foreign policy once confined to the margins of left-wing discourse in the United States is now more credible than the shopworn platitudes that many senior U.S. officials rely on to defend their actions.

"1gsq5si","What are some ways, even if childish, that you tried to be like characters in a book you loved?","When I was little, I really liked superhero comics so I often tried to dress like them or act like them. I think this desire to be like characters I admired or liked very much never quite left me. It just evolved and took new forms that were perhaps felt more mature but weren't really.

When I read The Outsiders, and later saw the movie, I put grease in my hair and wore leather jackets and just tried to act tough. I'm sure I wasn't the only one. I mean the movie had Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze....they defined cool and so everybody wanted to be like them.

The Count of Monte Cristo was a whole other story. I don't think I quite understood the narrative but it drove my imagination crazy. There was a girl in my class named Mercedes, and I had all these wild fantasies of finding treasure behind the school and getting my revenge. There was actually this mysterious well that remained uncovered and smelled of piss and gasoline, and my treasure was supposedly was at the bottom of it. Once I were to find it, then I would prepare to get my revenge on her boyfriend, a football player who was actually a nice guy. My only problem was me trying to change my voice and appearance. I found a wig and a fake mustache but didn't seem to really do much. So I gave up. And never did climb down that mysterious well to find my gold.

I was reminded of this today when I saw a thread on The Count of Monte Cristo, so I thought why the hell not, I'll embarrass myself and hope others will share a few embarrassing stories of their own. :)","2024-11-16 15:53:17 UTC",245

"1gr3l07","A religious person‚Äôs thoughts on The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale","I want to preface this by saying that this review is based on my own thoughts and experiences and do not reflect those of every Christian. I just made this post because being familiar with the Bible gives the book a whole other layer which I found interesting. 

So I went into this book completely blind without reading any reviews or discussions on it. I had heard of The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale before but literally did not know anything about it‚Ä¶which is surprising considering how popular the book is. Because of this, I was so lost until like the first quarter of the book when things had began to unfold. Once I got the hang of what was going on, I was shook. I loved Atwood‚Äôs use of non-linear storytelling. Although this made it difficult to follow the story at some point, I still think it was such a great way to keep the suspense and interest throughout the book. 

I was shocked at how real the book is. This book was written decades ago but still related to today‚Äôs decade in so many ways it‚Äôs scary. Although the chances of our world being thrown into a totalitarian government are slightly lower, it‚Äôs scary how (somewhat easy it will be). The book was able to capture that sentiment quite well. 

Now on to my thoughts about the book from a religious perspective. I consider the book a very good critique of Christian nationalism. From Wikipedia *‚ÄúChristian nationalism is a form of religious nationalism that focuses on promoting the Christian views of its followers in order to achieve prominence or dominance in political and social life‚Äù*   In simple terms, using the Bible and God to gain power over others. This occurred in Europe in the Middle Ages and even today there are quite a number of countries that still follow the ideologies of Christian nationalism. The portrayal of this ideology in the book is so spot on. One way is the use of biblical verses to reinforce certain ideas. In the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, certain bible verses are repeated over and over during certain events that they are entrained in the people‚Äôs subconscious minds. You see it a lot in the main character because although she is not a believer, at some point, she becomes influenced. 

Another way that Christian nationalist is portrayed in The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale is also the gatekeeping of the Bible or even any information in general. Bible‚Äôs are kept locked up and only opened during certain events for specific people to read. This is similar to what the Catholic church enforced during the Middle Ages where only priests had access to the Bible and the Bible could only be read in Latin. What this creates is that the people in power are able to bend the rules to their will‚Ä¶This is what we see in the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale where people in power are able to take certain liberties their subsidiaries cannot

I loved this book so much because of how spot on it is in showing how societies an easily be shaped to conform to certain ideologies especially by keeping people in ignorance. I hear it has been banned in certain schools in the States, which is so ironic considering the contents of the book. Reading the book as someone who has a bit of Bible knowledge was so interesting because I noticed how certain verses were taken out of context or tweaked to fit the oppressor‚Äôs narrative. The oppressors did not even have to change or uphaul much of the words in the Bible, but by keeping people in ignorance and constant indoctrination, a totalitarian state was created where people would not question anything. I rate this book an easy 4.3/5 stars. I regret waiting so long to read it.

"1gr0sbn","Just feel frustrated with people who think fiction (as opposed to nonfiction) is a waste of time. ","Had a bit of a debate with someone online about fiction vs. nonfiction. It came out of nowhere. The guy was talking about reading a certain president's memoir, then suddenly changed topics and said the following (paraphrasing a bit to leave us the swear words): ""I used to read fiction when I was younger but then I grew up and realized that it's time to step out of fantasy and into reality.""

He was a history buff and felt history is the ultimate nonfiction and that many of our world's problems was that young kids were sucked into fiction (he especially hated fantasy books) and know nothing about history, then grow up and repeat past's mistakes.

I ended the debate because I knew fiction matters yet was unable to defend my position, unable to explain what made fiction important. I could only say we as human beings are storytellers and that stories have been a part of our lives since the beginning. His sarcastic response was if I had read that in a nonfiction book.

Obviously he is not the only person who feels that way about nonfiction. I've come across this view before, although it comes in various flavors and different justifications. My problem is with the black-and-white nature of it. He constantly made it seem as if I was anti-nonfiction. You can value both fiction and nonfiction, can't you? And can criticize both as well. It's totally fine to say certain book of fiction is awful or a waste of time, but why go and label all of them so?

Or the trial, which is the reason I wanted to read it (I'm interested in legal dramas). Or it if has something to do with the relationship between father and his young daughter, Scout (the narrator).

Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is a widow who does an outstanding job not only as a lawyer but also as a father. He has great compassion, wisdom, and a strong sense of moral that he has tried to also instill in his kids. As you read the book, you see him again and again teach his kids that you gotta be brave and do the right thing even if almost the whole town is against you.

I quite enjoyed the relationship between Scout and her dad and starting to think that has been a big reason the book holds a special place for me. And wonder if there are other parent-child relationships that well-read posters like yourself found memorable from your readings?

To be clear, they don't have to fictional or positive. Terrible relationships are sometimes even harder to forget. So please share any such relationships you recall vividly, and if you can, say what it was about the relationship that you found unique or memorable.","2024-11-13 09:13:09 UTC",255

One thing that stands out across the book‚Äîand in much of WWII history‚Äîis that Hitler‚Äôs horrific actions didn‚Äôt start overnight; the Nazi rise was a gradual, chilling progression. Vladek‚Äôs story captures this slow build-up, where the early, smaller aggressions against Jews steadily grow, culminating in the full horror of the Holocaust.

I‚Äôm not saying the future of American government will mirror the events in Austria, Poland, and elsewhere under the Nazi regime because I don't want to diminish the severity of those times.

"1gxa0r3","The differences in bookish communities on IG/TikTok/X/Reddit","I love the bookish community and have observed some key differences in it on different platforms, so thought I'd share about my experience here.

I have been a lifelong reader, but only discovered the online bookish community during the pandemic. It started with bookstagram. Unbeknownst to me, there was a whole subculture on Instagram of people reading books and posting about them, sharing book recs as well as beautiful photos of books. I eagerly set up my own bookstagram account in January 2021 and quickly got connected with many other book lovers.

I was blown away by the depth of relationships I could form with people far away because we shared such similar interests. It was like finding my people, well into my 30s. I even met bookstagrammers in my same city that became some of my best friends in real life. I can honestly say that joining bookstagram changed my life!

I‚Äôve since joined the bookish community on other platforms: TikTok and Threads, with some experience on Twitter/X as well as now here on Reddit. I think they each have their own advantages and different emphases, so I thought I‚Äôd lay out my observations here.

**Instagram:**

The #bookstagram community is really robust, with many people involved for many years. I think it‚Äôs easiest to form a strong community here, with DM groups and buddy reads happening a lot. There‚Äôs a big emphasis on book reviews and beautiful pictures, but not quite as much as in the past because the algorithm is prioritizing video content over static photos.

**TikTok:**

There‚Äôs a big #BookTok community, but I think it‚Äôs harder to connect in an authentic way with other book lovers here because of the lack of messaging options (no group chats). The algorithm is fantastic though at helping you find readers who share your interest and it‚Äôs fantastic for finding book recs. The community seems to focus a lot on romance and fantasy, with spicy reads or dramatic action getting a lot of promotion (or maybe that‚Äôs just my own algorithm?)

**Threads/X/BlueSky:**

I‚Äôm lumping these together because of their similar formats. These are great platforms for authors to be on to promote their books and connect with other authors. There‚Äôs a robust reader community too, with an emphasis on book news and drama rather than individual book recs.

**Reddit:**

This is the place to come for info about anything and everything related to books. From really niche book recs to bookish awards or anything in between, the amount of searchable info is amazing. The book community here seems a bit more isolated, though, coming here more for specific questions and needs rather than trying to develop lasting relationships with individuals.

I‚Äôm fairly new to the bookish Reddit community though ‚Äì so please correct me on anything I‚Äôve gotten wrong!

Do you think I‚Äôve got the right read on each of the different communities? Anywhere I‚Äôm not looking for bookish community that I should be?

"1gwxkli","Why Lonesome Dove Deserves its Legendary Reputation","Sometimes, a book's reputation precedes it so much that you wonder if it can ever live up to the hype. For me,¬†*Lonesome Dove* not only lived up to my expectations‚Äîit far exceeded them.

I bought the book ages ago but kept putting off reading it. Finally, after finishing *All the Pretty Horses* for the second time, I decided to dive in. I was on a serious Western kick, but I worried *Lonesome Dove* might feel lesser by comparison. I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong. The two books are incomparable. While they both fall under the Western genre, comparing them feels like a disservice. They're just too different.

This book is a true epic, and I mean that in every sense of the word. It gave me the same sweeping, awe-inspiring feelings I had while reading Ken Follett‚Äôs *The Pillars of the Earth* and *World Without End*. The scale is immense, the storytelling masterful, and the world so vivid it feels like you‚Äôre travelling every dusty mile alongside the characters.

# The Writing: Breathtaking in Its Simplicity

Larry McMurtry‚Äôs writing style is completely different from, say, Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs flawless in its way. Where McCarthy leans toward sparse, poetic prose, McMurtry crafts vivid, almost painterly scenes. His descriptions are breathtaking and memorable.

Some images from the book have lodged themselves firmly in my mind. One of my favourites is the old hermit with his mounds of buffalo bones‚Äîa haunting symbol of changing times. Another unforgettable scene is the cattle in a St. Elmo‚Äôs firestorm, their horns lit by lightning as they journey north. McMurtry‚Äôs ability to capture such moments in stunning detail is one of the book‚Äôs greatest strengths.

# The Characters: Perfectly Realized

The cast of characters in *Lonesome Dove* is nothing short of perfection. Despite its sprawling narrative and large ensemble, every character‚Äîmajor or minor‚Äîfeels fully realized. Their drives, struggles, and triumphs are so authentic that they practically leap off the page.

What I found remarkable is how McMurtry makes you care equally for each storyline. Every character is flawed but layered with unique, redeeming qualities that make them unforgettable. It‚Äôs this balance of humanity and imperfection that brings the story to life.

# A Story Both Dark and Romanticized

*Lonesome Dove* captures the stark reality of life in the Old West while romanticizing it just enough to feel timeless. The danger is palpable‚Äîdeath seems to lurk around every corner of the journey from Texas to Montana. And yet, there‚Äôs also an undeniable beauty to McMurtry‚Äôs vision of the West: a land of endless peace and sparse grandeur, where the hardships only heighten the triumphs.

It‚Äôs a tragic story in many ways, marking the end of an era and the fading of the Old West as an idea and ideology. The tone is dark but not overwhelmingly so, always grounded in a sense of truth.

# Why You Should Read Lonesome Dove

If you‚Äôre hesitating because of the book‚Äôs length, don‚Äôt. The journey is absolutely worth it. McMurtry keeps the story fresh with changing scenery, a steady pace, and characters who draw you in completely.

I understand now why *Lonesome Dove* won the Pulitzer Prize and is so highly regarded. It‚Äôs beautiful, heartbreaking, and satisfying from start to finish. It‚Äôs an unforgettable journey with expertly crafted characters, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget it.

# Where to Go From Here

This was my first Larry McMurtry book, but it certainly won‚Äôt be my last. How do his other books compare? I know there are other books in the *Lonesome Dove* series, but I‚Äôm also curious about his other works. If you‚Äôve read anything else by McMurtry, what would you recommend? Are his other novels as good as this one? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

For now, I might take a short break from traditional Westerns, though I recently started *Outer Dark* by McCarthy. While it‚Äôs not a Western in the traditional sense, it has a rugged, frontier-like atmosphere and a dark, haunting quality that fits the genre in its own way. But Larry McMurtry has definitely got my attention.

# Final Thoughts

In short, *Lonesome Dove* is epic beyond belief. I wish there were a better way to describe it, but that‚Äôs truly the best word: *epic*. If you haven‚Äôt read it, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. It‚Äôs a time investment, but one that pays off in every way. This is a book that will stay with me forever, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier to have finally read it.

"1gw4vte","Why I feel lost reading the later dune books","Spoilers for the series up to maybe 50% of god emperor of dune

Also remember that this is just my opinion. You are allowed to enjoy the books and there is nothing wrong with it. This is just my experience. 

1. dune goes through many accepting periods throughout the series. There are events that take place that make you say ‚Äúwhy????‚Äù But you just have to accept them if you want to enjoy the story that comes next. It happens with Paul dying, with Leto fusing with the sand trout, and Leto fusing with the worm. I sometimes fall into this camp. I just wonder, ‚Äúfrom a writing perspective, when frank herbert sat down to write the book, what made him think turning the main character into a worm is a good idea?‚Äù 

2. This is sort of similar to my previous point but anything after dune messiah is so unexpected that it just feels out of place. If the events that in any other story, I think most people would be fine, but because it happened in dune, it can be a little jarring. I gave a similar example in a previous post. I think it fits in terms of plot but just in the feel of it. I apologize for it being crude. Imagine you‚Äôre watching a movie about a bullfighter. The whole movie, you watch the bullfighter struggle against the bull. But he sucks at his job. Audiences are getting bored. So one day, the bullfighter decides he must undergo physical changes to fight the bull. But instead of taking steroids or something like that, he shoots bull sperm into his veins and turns into a bull human hybrid that the crowd loves. That is what it‚Äôs like essentially when jumping from dune messiah to children of dune and god emperor. 

3. the stakes drastically decrease. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the larger stakes in the context of the story are huge. But the moment to moment stakes feel so redundant. It goes from ‚Äúour entire family is being attacked and we are stranded on a desert planet. How will we survive?‚Äù To ‚Äúour worm god is getting attacked by random thugs so the best army in the world has to kill these very unskilled fighters. Will they accomplish it?‚Äù

4. Unnecessary plot threads. So many plot threads get dropped between books that you wonder why they were even included. Farad‚Äôn had no impact on the story. And him getting BG training is even more useless since he doesn‚Äôt even use it and isn‚Äôt in the next book. The whole thing with jacurutu existing. Why does this random outpost of bandits matter? What makes jacurutu specifically matter? When Leto goes through the spice trance, why is harum so important? Why is he even included if he‚Äôs only mentioned once or twice in throwaway lines but somehow has the importance of a possession? It feels irritating reading 500 pages and 200 of those are just unnecessary things you will never see again or had any impact on the story. 

5. The characters make dumb decisions. Wensicia really thought in children of dune that she could kill the two children of the most revered emperor in mankind‚Äôs history, who also had the power to see the future, with two tigers. And that is what half of the book revolves around. 

6. the dialogue just tanks in quality with each book. In book one, it was clunky at best. In messiah, it was an irritation. In children it was unintelligible. And it gets better in god emperor but it is still probably some of the stiffest dialogue out there. 

Also the fact that there‚Äôs a long homophobic rant in god emperor about how if an army is composed of all men, they will turn gay then turn into rapists when they leave the military ","2024-11-21 01:55:09 UTC",125
"1gw3qpe","Any interesting experiences reading books in public?","Any experiences with reading books yourself or your reaction to other people in public places, like restaurants, the bus, library, etc.?

One time in a crowded bus I saw this young lady reading the same book I was reading, a Cormac McCarthy novel. I was in the bus standing and she was sitting. I have a hard time speaking to strangers but pushed through the anxiety and said, Sorry to bother you, I just noticed we're both reading the same book, do you like it?

She looked at me as if I had asked her the most intrusive question in the world, and just got up and went by the door and got off the next stop, never looking back. I was shaken up for a while, looking at people around who were looking back at me, all confused.

Another time I was reading a book in a restaurant a while back and an old man who was sitting on a nearby table from me suddenly bent over and elbowed me and said, with his mouth full of burger, What is the catch?

I was like, Huh?

He repeated his point. It took me a while to realize he was joking around, since the book I was reading was Catch-22. I laughed. He had nothing else to say and went back to wolfing down his food.","2024-11-21 01:01:45 UTC",508

I know the best selling novelist of all time doesn't need advertising, but seriously, if you love mysteries and crazy twists (that actually make sense) and mysteries you absolutely *can* solve (but probably won't), you owe it to yourself to read Christie.

Joyce arguably has at least two. You feel like you've earned one at the end of Ulysses, but then Finnegans Wake still lies ahead as the ultra-hard mode achievement.

"1gtstm8","Thoughts on the ""It Was All A Dream"" Twist?","I recently finished a book series (for anyone who is curious, it's the >!Pegasus series by Kate O'Hearn!<), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though it's technically geared towards children (and I'm in graduate school), I loved the characters and the way the author combined the real world with Roman mythology. Now, the series consists of six books, and there were so many instances where I had to force myself to stop and get some sleep because I had been glued to the pages. In other words, **I was completely lost in the world the author had built**...and then, I get to the last couple of chapters in the final book. The second-to-last chapter *ends* with what easily *could* be the main character's death.

Now, while I would have been sad if the main character had died, it would have honestly been preferable to the way the last chapter *starts* \\- with the main character's *waking up and finding herself in her apartment as if the entire series hadn't actually happened*! Her internal thoughts are *all about the dream she just had but couldn't quite remember*! I read that and was just TICKED OFF - thinking ""was this *entire* series **really just a dream the main character had**!?"" Granted, it is quickly revealed that the main character is only having this ""twist"" dream sequence because she is essentially in a kind of limbo between life and death. The chapter (and the series) ends with her *actually* waking up, seeing her closest friend (the one she made in the first book and **the one who kickstarted the adventures**), and feeling excited for any adventures to come.

Even though this series ***thankfully*** didn't follow through with the ""it was all a dream"" twist, my reaction to the fact that it was **teased in the first place** made me realize *just how much I hate this kind of twist*. It just feels like a huge let-down after spending so much time with fun characters and an amazing world. Now, because the ""twist"" wasn't really a twist, I will not be surprised if I find myself reading this series again. However, if the series really had been a dream for the main character, I don't think I'd be able to pick up the series again.

What about y'all? Whenever a series ends with ""it was all a dream"" (or something to that effect), how do y'all feel?","2024-11-18 01:04:52 UTC",356

"1gtham5","Noam Chomsky Has Been Proved Right ‚Ä¢ The writer‚Äôs new argument for left-wing foreign policy has earned a mainstream hearing. (Book review ""The Myth of American Idealism"")","For more than half a century, Noam Chomsky has been arguably the world‚Äôs most persistent, uncompromising, and intellectually respected critic of contemporary U.S. foreign policy,  seeking to expose Washington‚Äôs costly and inhumane approach to the rest of the world, an approach he believes has harmed millions and is contrary to the United States‚Äô professed values. As co-author Nathan J. Robinson writes in the preface, **The Myth of American Idealism** was written to ‚Äúdraw insights from across [Chomsky‚Äôs] body of work into a single volume that could introduce people to his central critiques of U.S. foreign policy.‚Äù It accomplishes that task admirably.

The central target of the book is the claim that U.S. foreign policy is guided by the lofty ideals of democracy, freedom, the rule of law, human rights, etc. For those who subscribe to this view, the damage the United States has sometimes inflicted on other countries was the unintended and much regretted result of actions taken for noble purposes and with the best of intentions. 

For Chomsky and Robinson, these claims are nonsense. Not only did the young American republic fulfill its Manifest Destiny by waging a genocidal campaign against the indigenous population, but it has since backed a bevy of brutal dictatorships, intervened to thwart democratic processes in many countries, and waged or backed wars that killed millions of people in Indochina, Latin America, and the Middle East, all while falsely claiming to be defending freedom, democracy, human rights, and other cherished ideals. U.S. officials are quick to condemn others when they violate international law, but they refuse to join the International Criminal Court, the Law of the Sea Treaty, and many other global conventions. Nor do they hesitate to violate the United Nations Charter themselves.

The record of hypocrisy recounted by Chomsky and Robinson is sobering and convincing. No open-minded reader could absorb this book and continue to believe the pious rationales that U.S. leaders invoke to justify their bare-knuckled actions.

The book is less persuasive when it tries to explain why U.S. officials act this way.  Chomsky and Robinson argue that U.S. foreign policy is largely the servant of corporate interests‚Äîthe military-industrial complex, energy companies, and ‚Äúmajor corporations, banks, investment firms. The picture is more complicated than they suggest. For starters, when corporate profits and national security interests clash, the former often lose out. Also, other great powers have acted in much the same way, inventing their own elaborate moral justifications. This behavior preceded the emergence of modern corporate capitalism.

Why do Americans tolerate policies that are costly, often unsuccessful, and morally horrendous? Their answer, which is generally persuasive, is twofold.  First, ordinary citizens lack the political mechanisms to shape policy. Second, government institutions work overtime to ‚Äúmanufacture consent‚Äù by classifying information, prosecuting leakers, lying to the public, and refusing to be held accountable. [Having written about these phenomena myself](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250234810/thehellofgoodintentions), I found their portrait of how the foreign-policy establishment purveys and defends its world view to be broadly accurate.

Despite some reservations, **The Myth of American Idealism** is a valuable work that provides an able introduction to Chomsky‚Äôs thinking. Indeed, if I were asked whether a student would learn more about U.S. foreign policy by reading this book or by reading a collection of the essays that current and former U.S. officials occasionally write in journals such as Foreign Affairs or the Atlantic, Chomsky and Robinson would win hands down.

I wouldn‚Äôt have written that last sentence when I began my career 40 years ago. I‚Äôve been paying attention, however, and my thinking has evolved as the evidence has piled up. It is regrettable but revealing that a perspective on U.S. foreign policy once confined to the margins of left-wing discourse in the United States is now more credible than the shopworn platitudes that many senior U.S. officials rely on to defend their actions.

"1gsq5si","What are some ways, even if childish, that you tried to be like characters in a book you loved?","When I was little, I really liked superhero comics so I often tried to dress like them or act like them. I think this desire to be like characters I admired or liked very much never quite left me. It just evolved and took new forms that were perhaps felt more mature but weren't really.

When I read The Outsiders, and later saw the movie, I put grease in my hair and wore leather jackets and just tried to act tough. I'm sure I wasn't the only one. I mean the movie had Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze....they defined cool and so everybody wanted to be like them.

The Count of Monte Cristo was a whole other story. I don't think I quite understood the narrative but it drove my imagination crazy. There was a girl in my class named Mercedes, and I had all these wild fantasies of finding treasure behind the school and getting my revenge. There was actually this mysterious well that remained uncovered and smelled of piss and gasoline, and my treasure was supposedly was at the bottom of it. Once I were to find it, then I would prepare to get my revenge on her boyfriend, a football player who was actually a nice guy. My only problem was me trying to change my voice and appearance. I found a wig and a fake mustache but didn't seem to really do much. So I gave up. And never did climb down that mysterious well to find my gold.

I was reminded of this today when I saw a thread on The Count of Monte Cristo, so I thought why the hell not, I'll embarrass myself and hope others will share a few embarrassing stories of their own. :)","2024-11-16 15:53:17 UTC",245

"1gr3l07","A religious person‚Äôs thoughts on The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale","I want to preface this by saying that this review is based on my own thoughts and experiences and do not reflect those of every Christian. I just made this post because being familiar with the Bible gives the book a whole other layer which I found interesting. 

So I went into this book completely blind without reading any reviews or discussions on it. I had heard of The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale before but literally did not know anything about it‚Ä¶which is surprising considering how popular the book is. Because of this, I was so lost until like the first quarter of the book when things had began to unfold. Once I got the hang of what was going on, I was shook. I loved Atwood‚Äôs use of non-linear storytelling. Although this made it difficult to follow the story at some point, I still think it was such a great way to keep the suspense and interest throughout the book. 

I was shocked at how real the book is. This book was written decades ago but still related to today‚Äôs decade in so many ways it‚Äôs scary. Although the chances of our world being thrown into a totalitarian government are slightly lower, it‚Äôs scary how (somewhat easy it will be). The book was able to capture that sentiment quite well. 

Now on to my thoughts about the book from a religious perspective. I consider the book a very good critique of Christian nationalism. From Wikipedia *‚ÄúChristian nationalism is a form of religious nationalism that focuses on promoting the Christian views of its followers in order to achieve prominence or dominance in political and social life‚Äù*   In simple terms, using the Bible and God to gain power over others. This occurred in Europe in the Middle Ages and even today there are quite a number of countries that still follow the ideologies of Christian nationalism. The portrayal of this ideology in the book is so spot on. One way is the use of biblical verses to reinforce certain ideas. In the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, certain bible verses are repeated over and over during certain events that they are entrained in the people‚Äôs subconscious minds. You see it a lot in the main character because although she is not a believer, at some point, she becomes influenced. 

Another way that Christian nationalist is portrayed in The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale is also the gatekeeping of the Bible or even any information in general. Bible‚Äôs are kept locked up and only opened during certain events for specific people to read. This is similar to what the Catholic church enforced during the Middle Ages where only priests had access to the Bible and the Bible could only be read in Latin. What this creates is that the people in power are able to bend the rules to their will‚Ä¶This is what we see in the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale where people in power are able to take certain liberties their subsidiaries cannot

I loved this book so much because of how spot on it is in showing how societies an easily be shaped to conform to certain ideologies especially by keeping people in ignorance. I hear it has been banned in certain schools in the States, which is so ironic considering the contents of the book. Reading the book as someone who has a bit of Bible knowledge was so interesting because I noticed how certain verses were taken out of context or tweaked to fit the oppressor‚Äôs narrative. The oppressors did not even have to change or uphaul much of the words in the Bible, but by keeping people in ignorance and constant indoctrination, a totalitarian state was created where people would not question anything. I rate this book an easy 4.3/5 stars. I regret waiting so long to read it.

"1gr0sbn","Just feel frustrated with people who think fiction (as opposed to nonfiction) is a waste of time. ","Had a bit of a debate with someone online about fiction vs. nonfiction. It came out of nowhere. The guy was talking about reading a certain president's memoir, then suddenly changed topics and said the following (paraphrasing a bit to leave us the swear words): ""I used to read fiction when I was younger but then I grew up and realized that it's time to step out of fantasy and into reality.""

He was a history buff and felt history is the ultimate nonfiction and that many of our world's problems was that young kids were sucked into fiction (he especially hated fantasy books) and know nothing about history, then grow up and repeat past's mistakes.

I ended the debate because I knew fiction matters yet was unable to defend my position, unable to explain what made fiction important. I could only say we as human beings are storytellers and that stories have been a part of our lives since the beginning. His sarcastic response was if I had read that in a nonfiction book.

Obviously he is not the only person who feels that way about nonfiction. I've come across this view before, although it comes in various flavors and different justifications. My problem is with the black-and-white nature of it. He constantly made it seem as if I was anti-nonfiction. You can value both fiction and nonfiction, can't you? And can criticize both as well. It's totally fine to say certain book of fiction is awful or a waste of time, but why go and label all of them so?

Or the trial, which is the reason I wanted to read it (I'm interested in legal dramas). Or it if has something to do with the relationship between father and his young daughter, Scout (the narrator).

Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is a widow who does an outstanding job not only as a lawyer but also as a father. He has great compassion, wisdom, and a strong sense of moral that he has tried to also instill in his kids. As you read the book, you see him again and again teach his kids that you gotta be brave and do the right thing even if almost the whole town is against you.

I quite enjoyed the relationship between Scout and her dad and starting to think that has been a big reason the book holds a special place for me. And wonder if there are other parent-child relationships that well-read posters like yourself found memorable from your readings?

To be clear, they don't have to fictional or positive. Terrible relationships are sometimes even harder to forget. So please share any such relationships you recall vividly, and if you can, say what it was about the relationship that you found unique or memorable.","2024-11-13 09:13:09 UTC",255

I‚Äôm not saying the future of American government will mirror the events in Austria, Poland, and elsewhere under the Nazi regime because I don't want to diminish the severity of those times.

"1goyog0","The only ""meh"" review you will ever read for Malazan Book of the Fallen - 7/10","Last year I started a search for the most Epic fantasy series ever written. A broad interpretation brought a broad list of series, but I decided on *Malazan Book of the Fallen* becuase it was advertised as super dense, complicated with politics and war, with prose bordering on literature-quality.

And boy was that all true.

I sort of enjoyed my 400 hours of reading (and listening to the magnificent Michael Page's audiobooks) of this 10 book series. I found, both before and after reading, that there were 2 camps of people when it comes to Malazan: People who think it is exceptional, and people who did not finish the first or second book. 

Well I finished it and I thought the whole experience was maybe not worth the time.... But I did enjoy many aspects of it... but even after I'm done I don't understand a lot of what the large plotlines were... Anyway here is the good and the bad from maybe the only person who thinks the entire thing was ""meh"":

***Pros***

1. There are some truly excellent fantasy elements to this story. There are gods. There are heroes. There are villains. There is magic. There is humor. There is tragedy. Like a LOT of tragedy. Anyone who likes fiction will be able to find stuff about these books they like.

2. A wide cast of characters that a reader can draw favor to. I can't imagine reading these books and not liking a handful of people.

3. The world is extremely complete. The author is an anthropologist, and it shows. Everything has history in these books: cities are ancient, and there is proof. There are flashbacks to the city when a different intelligent species lived there. Same with the land.

4. The military campaigns that took up a book length of reading were really good. The Chain of Dogs in the second book was some of the most exciting reading I've done.

5. Some of the deaths and battles were legendary. Don't want to spoil anything but there are some legendary scenes by anyone's standards.

6. There are some fairly unique things about Malazan that are just super fricken cool. There is a sword that is itself a world and captures the souls of the slain to pull a wagon away from Chaos itself.

***Cons***

1. The world is complex. Too complex for me. I read 10 books and I still don't understand some major plotlines (why did this god do that? Why did he want to?). Before beginning the series I read somewhere that the author wanted a series that you could reread and get just as much enjoyment out of it as the first time, and that it didn't lose that magical feeling that a book series can capture. I actually think if I were to re-read the series I would enjoy it more, but I absolutely do not have 400 hours to do that again lol.

2. It feels like some things are *deliberately* confusing for literally no other reason than to be confusing. Names of characters are super similar. Often a new POV will start with something like ""her hands were shaking in the cold, for the windows remained open for the breeze..."" and he won't tell you who the F he's actually taking about for a paragraph or two. Sure he sprinkles in some details sometimes that you'll remember ""oh it's cold in THIS location because THIS magic happened 5 chapters ago"" and you're suppose to remember that minute detail from 10 hours of reading ago.

3. The prose is extremely dense. I usually listen to books at ~1.5 speed. I listened to books 8 and 9 at 1.2 speed and quite frankly it was far too fast. I listened to important parts at 1.0 and the entire 10th book at 1.0. The plots, subplots, and major story arcs are complex already. Throw in some actual English literature and it get's super super difficult to go through quickly. My favorite quote from the book actually is a great example of this:

>As if true honesty belonged to solitude, since to be witnessed was to perform, and performance was inherently false since it invited expectation.

Stuff like this that you could just sit and think about for half an hour.... and it's page after page after page of this stuff! Definitely not for me, although this is just a preference and not an actual complaint.

4. There are plotlines that just don't matter at all to the story (as far as I can tell, I could be wrong, but see CONS 1, 2, and 3 lol). Like the series could have very easily been 1 book less and been just as good or better.

5. I don't understand why every character deliberately withholds information from others, and thus deliberately withholds information from the reader. Many many times there will be 2 characters in a mini-arms race of trying to figure out what the other knows about a mutually held goal and the characters will not say what they know. They will make implications of things they know that would reveal the least information possible to the other person. I have no idea why this distrust of people in the same group/army/race is such a huge theme in these books, and I honestly assume it's just the author being withholding for the sake of it. I am yet to discover a reason why Quick Ben doesn't tell anyone his plans, etc.

6. Characters are continually introduced so deep into the book that I assumed they were not important and were going to die off. But no, the character introduced in book 9 plays a  foundational role in book 10.... I just can't keep the 100s of people in my head!

***Overall***

Some truly exceptional parts in an extremely complex (both literally and narratively) world that nearly demands a reread for a basic level of understanding. Unfortunately, there are a lot of other books out there that I can spend 400 hours on that I have more confidence will be easier, more fun, yet just as enjoyable to read. To give a great example of all of the above, I present my favorite comedic non-spoiler scene, complete with as much context as the author gives from the book Midnight Tides (the 5th book in the series where we are on a new continent will all new characters lol):

>As they walked, Tehol spoke. ""...the assumption is the foundation stone of Letherii society, perhaps all societies the world over. The notion of inequity, my friends. For from inequity derives the concept of value, whether measured by money or the countless other means of gauging human worth. Simply put, there resides in all of us the unchallenged belief that the poor and the starving are in some way deserving of their fate. In other words, there will always be poor people. A truism to grant structure to the continual task of comparison, the establishment through observation of not our mutual similarities, but our essential differences.

>""I know what you're thinking, to which I have no choice but to challenge you both. Like this. Imagine walking down this street, doling out coins by the thousands. Until everyone here is in possession of vast wealth. A solution? No, you say, because among these suddenly rich folk there will be perhaps a majority who will prove wasteful, profligate and foolish, and before long they will be poor once again. Besides, if wealth were distributed in such a fashion, the coins themselves would lose all value - they would cease being useful. And without such utility, the entire social structure we love so dearly would collapse. 

>""Ah, but to that I say, so what? There are other ways of measuring self-worth. To which you both heatedly reply: with no value applicable to labour, all sense of worth vanishes! And in answer to that I simply smile and shake my head. Labour and its product be- come the negotiable commodities. But wait, you object, then value sneaks in after all! Because a man who makes bricks cannot be equated with, say, a man who paints portraits. Material is inherently value-laden, on the basis of our need to assert comparison- but ah, was I not challenging the very assumption that one must proceed with such intricate structures of value?

>""And so you ask, what's your point, Tehol? To which I reply with a shrug. Did I say my discourse was a valuable means of using this time? I did not. No, you assumed it was. Thus proving my point!""

>""I'm sorry, master"" Bugg said, ""but what was your point?""

>""I forget. But we've arrived. Behold, gentlemen, the poor.""","2024-11-11 18:05:19 UTC",158
"1goruym","No author name should be printed bigger than the title of the book itself","I have been looking at book covers and each time I dislike them more and more. Besides the covers with famous actors and stickers like ""NOW ON NETFLIX"", regular book covers are also starting to look bad. I don't care much about the author and I care more about the book itself, so when the name of the author takes 50% of the cover and then the title -the most important part- takes like 10-20%, or even less, of it, it looks bad. It makes me think that the only positive thing is that it was written by X, not that the book itself is good, that the title isn't even interesting or has to tell you anything.

And when displayed it looks more like an adoration altar for authors than a display of different books, stories, organised and unique spines, genres...","2024-11-11 13:12:24 UTC",309

"1gom7rk","Do you have a trigger word? A word that let's you know you're going to hate a book?","I am currently forcing my way through From Blood and Ash by Jennifer Armentrout and the word ""crimson"" is used far too often and makes me cringe every time. It was in the first paragraph telling me right then I'd made a mistake. It bothers me more than all of the other textbook tropes.


It always reminds me of that scene in 10 Things I Hate About You where the guidance counselor is trying to write her smutty romance novel.

What's your word?

Update: general census says orbs, preternatural, growling, padding feet, braid play, and the description of breasts or genitals are the most hated words.","2024-11-11 06:48:25 UTC",1805
"1gnxwky","Did you ever read a book that make you laugh out loud? What book and what passage?","I am not the kind of person who laughs out loud at things. I sometimes smile to myself and occasionally chuckle. And rarely at what I consider juvenile or meanspirited or grossout humor.

But there are exceptions, lol.

From time to time, I have come across something that was really funny, and maybe also as a result of being tired and unable to control myself, I have laughed out loud.

Most recently I was reading Moby Dick, and then came across this passage, which is about Ishmael and fellow sailors squeezing the oil from a recently killed sperm whale:

>Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers‚Äô hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,- Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.

Ishmael's excitement and the word play was just a little too much and I saw a couple of people look at me, probably wondering why I burst out laughing in this quiet coffee place.

Has that happened to you?

P.S. Moby Dick is a tough book to read (I don't even know how to classify it), and there are many terms you have to look up, but it's also quite hilarious in parts and generally entertaining.","2024-11-10 10:37:08 UTC",645

"1gnnatt","What's your most anticipated release in the next 6 months?","There are so many incredible books coming out in the next 6 months and I keep thinking what a great time it is to be a book lover!

Here are my most anticipated releases:

* ***Wind and Truth*** by Brandon Sanderson

This is the fifth book in the Stormlight Archives series. I fell in love with this series when I first read it in March and it really brought me back into reading after a couple years of struggling to read as much as I used to pre-2020. I feel like I read this series at the perfect time to get back.

* ***Onyx Storm*** by Rebecca Yarros

I've read each book in the series as its come out. I've always loved dragon rider books and romantasies so getting them combined into one has been an incredible experience. I've only ever listened to the audiobooks and that's how I'll be enjoying *Onyx Storm* as well!

* ***A Language of Dragon****s* by S.F. Williamson

I don't think I've heard too many people talk about this book but it's essentially an alternate history if dragons roamed the Earth. I've heard it's perfect for fans of *Fourth Wing* and *Babel*. Even though I haven't read the latter yet, it's on my longlist of a TBR. The marketing tag line immediately drew me in:

>Every act of translation requires sacrifice. Welcome to Bletchley Park . . . with dragons.

* ***Sunrise on the Reaping*** by Suzanne Collins

I've been a *Hunger Games* fan since before the first movie came out.

"1gm71rw","When was the last time you delayed finishing a book because you were enjoying it so much you didn't want it to end?","I know this sound dumb but I have this weird habit where if I'm really enjoying a book, which happens rarely enough, I sort of don't want it to end. With movies, I guess I've never actually stopped a movie to save it for another day. Maybe it never really occurred to me or maybe because watching TV or movies is a way more passive hobby. That's not true of books. Reading involves effort. And the more effort I put into it, if I enjoy it, the harder it is for me to end it. 

This usually happens with longer books that I have read. Naturally, these books take their time to establish the setting and introduce everybody to you gradually, so by the time you are in the middle of the book, you sort of feel like you have gotten to know the character quite well, like friends or family members.

For example, with Les Mis√©rables. The last few pages took forever to read. I didn't want it to end. I wanted there to be a Les Miserables 2 and Les Miserables 3, as often is with Hollywood movies that make a lot of money. I wanted to see what Jean Valjean is doing, how is Cosette managing, what new adventures await them.

So, after really having a great time with a book, I search like crazy for other highly rated books by the author, but often they do not match the intensity and power of the original, unless you happen to have started with a lesser known work by the author, which I rarely do. I go for their best books first. Only if I enjoy it, then I go back and try to find everything else they have written.

I don't get mad about this. I usually find it endearing, and if they overdue it, I can just skim.

An example of this would be Ian McEwan's *Saturday*. The main character is a neurosurgeon. There are so many digressions in that book where McEwan is aggressively showing the reader how much he learned about the brain. Sometimes, it adds something important to the narrative or deepens the character. At other times, McEwan is just crowbarring in some interesting detail he learned.

This isn't a complaint or anything. It's just a kind of a sweet little thing I love about reading.

"1gkdswv","Why Reading Matters","Something about this US election is making me want to encourage everyone to read more literature. I'm going to write down some things I've been thinking for years. I'm not sure if this will be of any use to anybody, but I figure it can't hurt to share. 

The point of reading is not just to learn stuff or be entertained. You will forget most of what you learn and most of what entertains you. Knowledge and entertainment are flimsy, fleeting things. They come. They go. And when they go, you will be left sitting in a chair, searching for the next distraction from the pain you're in. 

Reading is difficult because it requires you to make so many decisions. The whole time you read, you have to continuously decide to not stop reading. Then you have to decide what each word means. Then you have to decide how the meaning of that word relates to the rest of the words around it. Then you have to decide the purpose of each paragraph or stanza, and you have to figure out how it relates to all the other paragraphs or stanzas. Sometimes, when you can't figure out what something means, you have to accept your confusion and press on.

It's easier to just not read. It's easier to let a video wash over you. Here is why. Visual entertainment requires very little of you. If you stop thinking, the video keeps happening. You can passively receive it. If you stop reading, the story stops, too. With reading, you're completely in charge of the experience. Your brain is churning. You're working. It's tough. There is nothing passive about it. 

But the more you do it, the more your brain habituates that meaning-making mode. You start to interpret life actively. You naturally ask questions, piece things together, decide what makes sense, decide what doesn't. If you read enough, then your brain becomes inherently critical, which is the opposite of passive.

So even if you forget most of what you read, the practice of reading will make you harder to manipulate, since you will be used to doing the hard work of interpreting. The less you read, the easier you are to manipulate, since your brain gets accustomed to being a passive receptacle of images and information. You simply don't have to work as hard to consume a video than you do when you consume written language, and the hard work of reading is exactly the thing that will keep your mind potent, independent, critical, and growing.

But a more critical mind is not the main reason I'm encouraging you to keep reading during this era of endless entertainment. I'm encouraging you to keep reading because you are sometimes going to feel brutally, severely alone. And when writers use language to try to capture what it feels like to be alive, you can catch a glimpse of yourself in their language, and you can realize, in a really powerful way, that others have felt just as alone as you are feeling, and you can connect with those writers across time and space, and you can be together with them in your aloneness.

There is a reason that the dictators always burn and ban literature. When people read literature, they encounter the human experience in a uniquely intimate way. The reader envisions what it is like to be inside another body, since the language within a book emerged from within another body, the author's body. And when people do this regularly, they develop a deep empathy. Empathetic people do not want to fall in line with violent leaders. They do not want to be manipulated into hurting people. They understand that every human life is as potent and vivid as their own.

So keep reading. Your brain will work better. And you will be harder to manipulate. And you will be less alone. ","2024-11-05 18:37:15 UTC",215
"1gk40ni","Why do you think Murakami references brands by name every chance he gets?","Murakami never says things like ""He pulled out a cigarette"", ""He poured himself a soda"" or ""we drove past a few burger joints"". He always says ""He pulled out a Marlboro"", ""He poured himself a Perrier"" and ""we drove past a few McDonalds"". In Kafka on the Shore, >!mascots become real characters who drive the plot like Johnnie Walker and the KFC Colonel!<. I've heard people say that it's some kind of critique of consumerism and Japan's loss of soul but to me at least it does not feel critical, it just feels acknowledged. If anything it sometimes feels elevated in a Warholian still-life sort of way. I'm not sure why he does that myself, but the effect it has on me as a reader is that it blurs the line between the book's universe and my universe. It's rare for books or movies to dwell so much on real brands so when it does happen it really anchors the universe to our reality and our everyday experience, which makes the bizare stuff that happens in his books feel more real. I remember watching a movie called ""Escape from Tomorrow"" (2013) which was filmed guerilla-style in Disneyland and there was a scene where >!the main character is tied up on a bed inside a spooky lab and is being experimented on by an android. The scene is generally pretty goofy and stereotypical but the fact that the lab is located inside a real attraction in Disneyland and that the android and the lab machines both have a large SIEMENS logo on them makes it really bizarre for me. It really felt like I was seeing real found footage from some kind of weird corporate conspiracy!<. Murakami's books produce a similar effect.

I was recently reading Eruption, a novel that Michael Crichton started writing but was left unfinished at the time of his death. Years later, Crichton‚Äôs widow enlisted James Patterson to complete the book. 

That got me thinking of other instances where an author died and left a story unfinished (Charles Dickens, Robert E. Howard, V.C. Andrews, Robert B. Parker, just to name a few) and somebody came in and finished their story, trying to capture the same ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the original author. 

The results (at least to me) mostly fall short, the work in question coming off as a disjointed mess. 

Or when an author will write a popular book series and then die and then the estate will hire another author to write new books in the series. I understand the desire to want to tell new stories in that narrative world and to not let the characters die, but much of the time the results come off like cheap fanfiction. 

However, there are to me those rare instances where it actually works but I‚Äôm curious to know what your thoughts are. ","2024-11-05 06:46:23 UTC",197

One is the various isms (racism, sexism, and the like). I think I have become desensitized to them from having read too many older books that were written at a time when these bigoted attitudes were the norm and many people were not aware of the damage that these stereotypical views caused. 

So now if I'm reading a contemporary crime novel and the detective is a bit of a macho guy and sexist, I continue reading, though feeling a little annoyed. But if I find that the detective is actually what the author believes and that the author is kind of hiding behind the character but has an agenda, I will stop.

What are some things that reduce your enjoyment but will not stop you from reading? And when do they become too much?

Because I don‚Äôt mean disturbing like, ‚Äúdamn‚Ä¶ This is kind of messed up‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äô I mean disturbing like, ‚Äúthis is so fucked up that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to finish it.‚Äô‚Äô The word disturbing can take on several different meanings. So you can interpret it however you‚Äôd like. But, to me, disturbing is something that either disgusts you, triggers you, makes you so angry that you want to cry, or rips your heart out in a way that makes you wanna launch the book across the room. But it‚Äôs almost as if there is some type of gravitational pull keeping your eyes glued to the pages.  

I‚Äôm 31 years old and have been reading since I was a child. I have come across very few books that have actually managed to disturb me. The first book I ever read that I found to be slightly disturbing was the lovely bones by Alice Sebold. I read it when I was only 16 years old, so, back then, it was pretty messed up. It became one of my favorite books of all time though, hands-down,. Now that I am an adult, I think two of the most disturbing books I have ever read are Tampa by Alyssa nutting and My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell.  

I‚Äôm only halfway through Tampa right now and honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm gonna be able to finish it. The protagonist is, without a doubt, the most sociopathic MC I have ever come across.  

My Dark Vanessa, however, is one of the most disturbing, yet beautifully heart wrenching portrayals of trauma that I have ever read in my life. I would almost bet money that Kate Elizabeth Russell has been through something similar herself. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt see any way she would be able to capture it so brilliantly. In my opinion, it truly is a literary masterpiece.  

So, what about y‚Äôall? What‚Äôs the most disturbing book you‚Äôve ever managed to get through? What made it so disturbing? What ultimately made you decide to keep reading?

"1gioxz1","What is magical realism?","I have a theory that books fall on a spectrum of magical realism instead of just being an either or situation. I‚Äôve been very interested in this genre of books for a while now but I‚Äôve only been able to read just one or two books in that category. This is because of how challenging it is to truly grasp books with magical realism. It‚Äôs such a unique art form to be able bridge the normal and abnormal and I will always appreciate that. I realised that it can be so ambiguous to define magical realism though. For example, while many people view Babel as fantasy, I think it‚Äôs magical realism (having that perspective made me enjoy the book more tbh). I have always thought of The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka as magical realism as well as Before The Coffee gets cold. Even The Secret History had hints of magical realism. i think my idea of magical realism is quite broad. But that‚Äôs why I want to know, when does a book leave the sci-fi and fantasy realm and become magical realism?

"1gihx3m","How do you guys feel about unreliable narrators??","Personally, I have mixed emotions about them. In some cases, the author can make it work. For example: Gone Girl by Jillian Flynn. The diary entries were a great way to pull it off. She meant for the diary to be found, which is why she was pretending to be something she wasn‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs something like that, it tends to work well. Letters to another person, or if something happened to make the narrator unreliable. A mental illness or a head injury for instance. What I don‚Äôt like, however, is when they are unreliable for absolutely no reason at all. Like, when the ending comes, and it‚Äôs completely unbelievable because the narrator has been one person throughout the entire book all the way up until the end and then they have a complete personality switch out of nowhere. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. One book that does this is You Shouldn‚Äôt Have Come Here by Geneva Rose. It‚Äôs written in the style of Gone Girl. The book switches back-and-forth between the perspectives of two different narrators, male/female. We are put into the minds of both individuals throughout the book, then at the end, the unexpected twist comes, and suddenly they are no longer who we thought they were at all. But there‚Äôs no reason for the random personality  shift whatsoever. it comes totally out of nowhere and is just extremely unbelievable/unrealistic. It‚Äôs almost as if the author were in a hurry to finish the book, and just completely changed her characters into totally different people and scribble down some random ending for the sake of finishing the book. There‚Äôs no foreshadowing or any type of clues leading up to the twist at all. I don‚Äôt like this. It left me with a lot of confusion and unanswered questions. How do you guys feel about unreliable narrators? In your opinion, when do they work and when do they not? Feel free to provide examples for both. Books where the author makes it work, and books where they don‚Äôt.  

Note: I only ask to provide examples so that I can see what your idea of a good unreliable narrator is versus a bad one. That is not a recommendation/suggestion request. Examples are not necessary. I would just like to know how y‚Äôall feel about unreliable narrators in general. I hope this post doesn‚Äôt get removed because of the last sentence!!  

Edit: after another person mentioned it in the comments below, I would like to add that another type of unreliable narrator I happen to enjoy is one that has a distorted view of reality for some reason. For instance: they are extremely immature or self-centered, they are paranoid, they are being gaslighted by someone important to them, etc. One major example I can think of is My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell. The teenage protagonist, Vanessa, is being gaslighted by her teacher who is 27 years older than her. She is so traumatized and blinded by his gaslighting that she thinks they are in love. She doesn‚Äôt realize that he is a predator who has groomed her to fall in love with him. she is so unreliable, in fact, that we as the reader actually believe it‚Äôs love as well until we start to see the truth about midway through the book. Sadly, though, Vanessa doesn‚Äôt realize it until the end.","2024-11-03 07:53:59 UTC",104

"1gi331u","I'm convinced Stephen King doesn't know anything about kids/teens anymore","I'll preface by saying I'm a guy nearing 40, but I just finished listening to Under the Dome. I enjoyed it for the most part, but throughout I became more and more convinced King just can't write relatable kid/teen characters anymore. Some might argue that he's always had trouble (infamous IT scene as a glaring example), but after so many 1930-50s-type references coming from kids' mouths I just started rolling my eyes.

One kid makes a ""this is another nice mess you got me in,"" jab at another like it's something people do every day, which is from 1930s Laurel and Hardy. Another instance has a teen casually saying something like, ""like Lon Chaney dancing with the Queen,"" either from the 1941 The Wolf Man movie or more likely the 1970s Werewolves of London song.

Maybe I'm wrong, but do kids and teens know Laurel and Hardy references? Was The Wolf Man or Waren Zevon still on some people's radar like it's second nature when Obama was president (which is when the book takes place)?

One such book is Anna Karenina. I am slowly making my through, often only reading it one or two days out of the week, and I can honestly say I am retaining the information much better and enjoying the experience more! It has allowed me to really live in the space of the book and take my time digesting and mulling over what I am reading.

On the other hand, the books which I've sped through are often forgotten a day after I've finished. I'm now trying to actively think about and analyze the books I'm reading, especially those which I finish in a few days.

Overall, I can say that for me, reading simply to get my numbers up or reach a goal is preposterous and unneccessary, and frankly not as rewarding. Reading should be enjoyable and leisurely.

Then I read the final novel, The Lady of The Lake. It read like author Andre Sapkowski did everything he could to avoid a more traditional ending to a fantasy series. To the detriment of the book. >!There were just long scenes of Geralt fucking, the character given up on his quest throughout most of the book. Then it just ends in the least climactic way possible with Geralt seemingly intentionally getting himself killed. !<

What other sagas ended so badly it seemed like a fuck you letter from the author? Or it could even be sequels.","2024-11-01 01:35:38 UTC",578
"1ggjp4l","What's an interesting reading habit you picked up recently? ","I've been having trouble concentrating on reading. Reading on a kindle has been strangely helpful so I mainly read books on there now, however, I wanted to read the Stormlight Archive (I'm on book 2 now lol) and I own the chunky mass market paperback editions, which are on my bookshelf (physical bookshelf just fyi). 
I borrowed the audiobook from the library (since it's free you know lol) and I let it play while having the book out in front of me. I was shocked at how easier it was for me to digest the story and follow along without getting distracted. 

So yeah, anyway, what's your interesting reading habit that you've taken to doing recently? ","2024-10-31 17:13:49 UTC",168
"1ggb40u","My local community put little free libraries next to all the schools, and seeing the difference between the high income areas and low income is heartbreaking.","The nicest ones are always full of new looking books and even candy to encourage kids to look inside. One of them near me gets so many nice donations that the caretaker put a bench next to it that you can open and place books into. Usually the bench is also full of nice books.

I kind of appointed myself to take care of the one near my daughter's school because most of the students are low income (a ""Title 1"" school in legal terms), but in a blue collar way. The box is often disorganized. The children are like vultures when there are actually good books in there. I cleaned it out and while the box was mostly empty, there was crumpled paper in there, someone's old birthday cards, chewed up board books, and there are *always* evangelical prayer books, bibles, tracts, etc because apparently the box is someone's mission field. I carefully time my donations to the box to be shortly before school lets out so that books like Captain Underpants will get snatched up by the kids instead of by someone with a religious agenda.

When I drive downtown (~10 minutes from my house), to an area that has mostly black students, the little free library is empty. The layer of dust on the shelves is undisturbed, and there are cobwebs. There has also been a debacle recently where a library branch had to close completely during the hours immediately after school lets out because the school district doesn't provide bussing, so while waiting for the city bus, kids would go into the library. I saw with my own eyes that there were many kids doing homework. But there were also kids causing the elevator to lock up by jumping in it, vandalizing things and starting fist fights. The potential bookworms there have few opportunities to develop their love of literature because of all this.

I guess I'm just posting to encourage people with extra children's books to consider diverting a bit out of the way to find a sad empty little free library to fill. There is a ""last chance"" Goodwill near me that takes unsold items from other thrift stores and sells them by the pound. I rummaged around there this week and found a lot of good books! Goosebumps, the box car kids, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and a copy of The Hunger Games all went into a little free library and are probably already gone. I paid $0.89 per pound for about 7 pounds of books to give away because pulp fiction paperbacks are pretty lightweight.

Full disclosure, I'm in Ohio and many kids here are part of Dolly Parton's imagination library, which is *wonderful*. But once the kids are old enough to want early chapter books instead of picture books, people don't donate those as much. And before anyone jumps in about ebooks, a lot of these students have to turn in their cellphones at the beginning of the school day. So that makes them need actual books even more.

If you've read this far, thanks.","2024-10-31 10:17:53 UTC",516
"1gg0dmp","Did fame and popularity affect any other author as badly as it did to George RR Martin?","Huge fan of George and he seems like a great guy. His books are some of my favourites, definitely before I read any of Joe Abercrombie's work. 

However, no matter how you look at it, ever since he struck sword throne heights of mega-stardom while the first series of Game of Thrones aired, his creativity for the main series has been completely stifened. Dance of Dragons (fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series) was published a few months after the first episode aired. Exactly 13 years 3 months and weeks ago (thank my Alexa for working that out).

Okay, yes, Fire and Blood (2018) was also fantastic and I'm so glad it exists...

Anyway, so it got me thinking. Did fame and popularity affect another artist's creativity disastrously? 

I've heard of a few examples, like Patrick Rofthuss (Kingkiller Chronicles) and Scott Lynch (Gentleman Bastards). Any more?

Doesn't have to be in regards to writer's block either. Maybe of authors where the fame went completely to their heads?

Edit: So everyone is commenting about George but this post wasn't made to complain about him. I am more interested about stories regarding other authors who have been affected by fame. Surprise me! I was merely using GRRM as an example.","2024-10-30 23:20:24 UTC",936
"1gfutz8","Do you intentionally spoil books for yourself, why or why not?","When I was in high school, we were reading some book and my teacher spoiled the ending for us. The whole class basically screamed, ""Spoilers!!"" To which my teacher responded with something along the lines of, ""If you're too focused on what happens next, you won't pay attention to what is happening now."" 

I used to spoil things for myself constantly, that way I could focus on what was happening now. I didn't have to wonder what happened next, I already knew. I could appreciate foreshadowing, metaphors, other literary devices. 

My friends and husband began admonishing me for this behavior and that I should appreciate the journey, not the destination. 

I've recently decided to read all of The Vampire Chronicles. I had a feeling when I picked up the series that this would be influential to me as a person and had the chance to become a cherished universe. In many fandoms, I think there's this sense of how lovely it would be to read the books again for the first time. So I decided to not spoil anything for myself, I wanted to do what so many fans wish they had done and truly appreciate that first read. 

And in retrospect, I felt like I flew through Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned because I knew something was being built up to. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it, whatever it was, was coming. And came it did. 

I'm only about halfway through the series, I just finished The Vampire Armand and am currently reading the Mayfair Witches before attacking Merrick. As more characters and lore are being introduced into this universe, I want to re-read the original three books. In my search to learn what was happening next, I missed a lot of this is happening now. I sort of regret not spoiling the books for myself, almost like I truly couldn't appreciate that first read like I intended. 

In general, whenever I re-read a book, I feel I take away more from the story since I can focus on the now. Sort of like when you re-watch the Sixth Sense. Which is why I feel like maybe you should spoil the story for yourself and my English teacher was right. But isn't there also something really satisfying about a good  M. Night Shyamalan twist?","2024-10-30 19:20:27 UTC",309
"1gfi66h","I really didn't like Huckleberry Finn's ending. Which book did you enjoy...except for the ending?","Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a great read. It's full of adventure but also gets you to think about a lot of important things, like societal rules and hypocrisy, poverty, racism, slavery, freedom, friendship, etc.

I was enjoying reading the book except the ending really surprised me but in a bad way. That's when Tom Sawyer shows up and suddenly turns a serious situation (can't say more without giving away important plot points) into a child's play, a game, and totally changes the tone of the book.

I have no idea what happened. It's almost as if Mark Twain was trying to write two different novels and liked the first one but accidentally attached the ending of a second one to it.

I'm not sure if the change was as disturbing to other readers as it was for me, but not a lot of people talk about it. I guess it pales in comparison to controversy about the use of N word.

I haven't read much of classic books but whatever new fiction I read, I found it to be lacking depth etc. Also my experience tells me that most of the "" best sellers"" list books of recent times don't appeal much to me.

"1gfd5d8","What are your favorite depictions of afterlife (hell in particular but also heaven and purgatory) in literature?","Halloween is nearly here so I've come across a lot of questions on Reddit about Hell and I thought why not, let me ask another. But I'm generalizing my question to include afterlife, so literary references to heaven and purgatory are welcome too.

Okay, so pretty much everybody who talks about afterlife in literature at some point references Dante's Inferno. Which I have been meaning to read but never have. Or rather I did try, but the particular translation I was reading was so confusing I gave up on it twice, after reading a few pages.

But I've come across quite a few descriptions of afterlife elsewhere and the one that stayed with me the most was Joyce's.

In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce does not take us to hell directly but indirectly through a very long lecture about what hell must be like. It's a lecture the narrator is forced to sit through.

It goes on for pages but here is a sample:

>The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast reeking sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged the world. The brimstone, too, which burns there in such prodigious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench; and the bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential odour that, as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world, that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has been long enclosed. 

>Consider then what must be the foulness of the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jellylike mass of liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to flames, devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And then imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in the reeking darkness, a huge and rotting human fungus. Imagine all this, and you will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell.","2024-10-30 03:09:07 UTC",142
"1gf67xh","I read Dracula and Frankenstein back to back for Spooky Season. Here are my thoughts. ","The first of the books I read was Dracula. It was a really fun adventure with some creepy atmosphere. I really enjoyed the epistolary format. I liked the characters and wanted to see them overcome Dracula. It did drag a bit in the middle, but I expect that to some degree, even with modern books. And the repetition could be annoying, but I have heard that it was originally published a chapter at a time in an old literary magazine so some repetition is to be expected. I would absolutely recommend it to someone who has patience with books, especially if they're looking for something different than modern books tend to offer. Overall, I'm glad that I read it first. 

Frankenstein, however, I did not enjoy. I will admit that a large part of that feeling is that Victor Frankenstein is the worst kind of overentitled spoiled brat who refuses to own up to any mistakes. But I just felt like the whole novel was a slog in which I was mentally yelling at him to make literally any other choice.

That being said, I feel like Frankenstein is the more important novel to read. It may be the most important novel I can even remember reading. The message of taking care of the people we bring into the world is especially poignant in an age of iPad kids and robots that are (supposedly) self aware enough to end their own existence in the face of endless labor. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the conversation the novel poses or the history of science fiction in general.

As an aside, it's a shame that these two novels are so overshadowed by the 1930s movies that barely resemble the novels in anything but name.","2024-10-29 21:36:15 UTC",211

It seemed like more of that ""turn the other cheek"" recycled and whitewashed for the NYT and NPR crowd. But having gone through some shit, and still going through same said shit, and more or less reading his stories almost by accident, I feel like they're actually pretty deep and subversive? I got the distinct feeling from his stories that kindness may be the purest and most effective violence one can practice, sometimes. Not for nothing do we have cliches like ""kill them with kindness.""

"1gei9yq","Which authors, living or dead, you would love to have lunch with, or spend an hour talking with them?","Sorry for the awkward question. What I mean by having lunch with is just being in their presence. Someone who is a huge fan of the spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle told me exactly that. Just being in the guy's presence, he said, would bring him so much joy and peace.

For me though, I like to spend the time talking to the authors I like. Because a book, I feel, is a kind of conversation, even if it appears one-sided at first. Books exist to be read by people. The author sits in a room for many hours writing for an imaginary or ideal reader. The author has things to say about life, beauty, power, violence, despair, friendship, love, freedom, pain, fear, loneliness, etc. He or she wants to create certain feelings and stimulate some thoughts in the reader and be heard and understood.

At least that's how I look at it.

So if I had an hour with Kurt Vonnegut, I want to ask him: What do you think of human beings and the future of humanity? How have your views changed over time? Do you think we are doomed or do you see glimmers of hope? Tell me about Slaughterhouse-Five. How did it come to you and how did you write it? What's your favorite passage? How do you feel about the book after all these years? Would you change any of it?

"1gecyaq","How can I get my son to enjoy reading?","My son is 8 and just does not enjoy reading. He avoids it all costs. He's in a reading assistance program at school but he's still behind. They let him pick reading games on a computer, and he says he always picks the game that reads to him so he doesn't have to read. I've read to him for 30 minutes a day since basically birth. For the most part he likes books, he just won't read them himself. He won't even play video games if he has to read to figure out what to do. We go to the library regularly and I let him pick out any book he wants. But he won't read them. He'll only listen if I read them to him. I've modeled reading for him -- I read before bed every night and on the weekends when I can.

To be clear I don't really care if he enjoys reading as a hobby. I just want him to start doing it on his own so he can do well in school. He's great at math but can hardly do the word problems on his own.

It was 2021 and I was immersed in reading Gone to the Woods by Gary Paulsen - an autobiographical collection of stories of his difficult and compelling childhood. He found solace in nature in a way that is deeply relatable to me.

About 3/4 through the book I was in the car listening to NPR, when they announced Gary Paulsen had died that day. I cried the entire drive home. To have him die while reading his memoir was extremely intense; like losing a friend.

Here are mine:
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.  Even though it's short, I think I would recommend it at the college level to avoid shallow take-aways.

Speaker for the Dead
I think this is valuable because it demonstrates that our assumed reasons for other people's behavior often does not match the real reasons.  People are complex, and in order to know why they do the things they do, we have to be willing to see things from their point of view.

"1gbirhj","I read Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"", and it was hauntingly beautiful and powerful.","As much as I enjoy reading good novels, they practically never get a true visceral reaction out of me. The closest I got to that was A Farewell to Arms. However, after reading one of Cormac McCarthy's other novels, Blood Meridian (which is amongst my favorites) I really wanted to read the Road. I had watched the movie a while before and I remembered liking it, so I decided to buy the book, and I'm glad I did!

This story was so interesting to me I read the entire book (almost 300 pages) in less than 2 days. The best word I can describe this book as, is ""haunting"". It's a tragic story of a father doing his absolute best to take care of his son in a post-apocalyptic world full of starvation, violence, cannibalism. Everyone is on the fight for survival. All are trying to take care of themselves or their families. And the main character, simply known as ""the man"", is no exception. He steals and loots for the sake of his son's safety and welfare.

The two main characters are exceptionally realistic, to the point where it hurts to read. They speak to each other incredibly naturally, like a father would with his young boy to try to make him happy and take care of him. I could easily see my father in the same position as the Man and myself as the Boy, making the same decisions, saying the same things, and thinking the same thoughts. Through their hardships and adventures, they are some of the most deeply personal characters I've seen in a story. It makes sense that this book was inspired by McCarthy's own conversations with his son, since it has such a simple and beautiful genuineness to it, as if these were conversations that were already spoken.

Unlike a lot of McCarthy's other works, it doesn't depict heavy amounts of extreme depravity or sadistic violence, but it mostly consists of the Man and the Boy repeating the cycle of survival. Scavenging for food, searching through abandoned homes and shelters, gathering resources, engaging in conversation with each other, and following the road to the coast. The story is mostly a repeated cycle of this, with some occasional, more intense sequences of suspense sprinkled in carefully. The rare amount of suspense and heavy use of conversations between the Man and the Boy builds up the characters to make them more relatable and understandable, which I think it succeeds exceptionally in doing. By the second half, all I wanted was just for the father and his son to escape, alive and well.

As for the ending (which I will not spoil), I've never cried to a book until I read The Road. The ending was achingly sad, but I wouldn't say it was bleak or hopeless, unlike Blood Meridian's ending. As tragic as it is, there was an element of hope, joy, and positivity. At the last few pages of the novel, the father talks to his son about ""carrying the fire"" to other people. I am not sure exactly what this means, but I interpreted the act of ""carrying the fire"" as spreading humanity's indomitable will to survive to other people, so they may get through the hardest of times (like the trials the father and son go through together). Kind of like the movie ""Grave of the Fireflies"", I thought it was tragic and heart-wrenching, but not with beauty and hope.

I recommend everyone to give this book a try.

"1gbiixh","Which books have had a negative impact on your life? ","Some books can help us navigate difficult times if we read them at the right moment, but there are also books that can affect us negatively if read at the wrong time.

Right now, I‚Äôm trying to read Lolita, but I think I‚Äôll set it aside for now (because of the sensitive topic it deals with. I went through some traumatic experience involving sexual assault so It is quite triggering for me). In the past, when I was struggling with depression, I read The Midnight Library, which actually worsened my mental state because of the depressing main character and complete misunderstanding of the depression described in the book, It seemed like the book was saying, life could be worse, or whatever choice you make, you would still be miserable so just don't be depressed.

It might sound a bit extreme, but books have a profound impact on my mental health and life. Atomic Habits changed my life for the better.

Are there any books that have negatively affected your mental health? Feel free to share which books helped you improve as well.","2024-10-25 01:11:37 UTC",1031

"1gb54ha","I can't get enough of the unhinged female protagonist","I don‚Äôt know about you, but I love books with an unlikeable female protagonist. This trope has been around for a while now, but its shape and meaning has transformed under the guise of an ever-changing society. Throughout history, the chaotic female character has been used to fight back against the ideals and norms of society when it comes to what‚Äôs expected of us as women. You might be familiar with Charlotte in The Yellow Wallpaper or Mr. Rochester‚Äôs first wife Bertha in Jane Eyre.¬†

The unhinged female protagonist doesn‚Äôt stop there. We have an array of modern day equivalents. Take the show Fleabag, for example. The character is angry, brushing off anyone who tries to help her through as she battles with grief. She has no filter and uses humor as a defense mechanism. There‚Äôs the book Nightbitch, about a woman dealing with the struggles of her new life as an isolated mother. She misses her life as an artist, before she had a child. Throughout the story, we follow her as she evolves into an angry, feral dog-like being. The book is depicted by many as a metaphor for postnatal depression. Finally, Irina from Boy Parts is a self-destructive, unlikeable narcissist who commits some awful acts. I didn‚Äôt like Irina at all, in fact I found her to be an appalling person, and yet I still found her a wholly fascinating character.¬†

For some reason, these characters draw us in. From the murders they commit to the awful words they say, there‚Äôs just something about the way they are that makes them so thrilling to read about.

Perhaps it‚Äôs the fact that they challenge what‚Äôs expected of them. As women, we‚Äôre often told to tone it down, smile more, be less of this and more of that. Why can‚Äôt we just‚Ä¶ be? And that‚Äôs exactly what these characters accomplish. They resonate with us because they are empowered. Yes, their actions may be more on the extreme end of the spectrum, with their murders and what not. But, you have to admit, having a female protagonist who isn‚Äôt afraid to go after what she wants makes for a riveting read.

Do you enjoy the unhinged female character trope? If so, what is it that draws you in?

"1gb05s1","This continued discourse around trigger warnings is strange to me.","I don‚Äôt know if this is true for other social platforms, but on spaces like X, Instagram, and Threads, there seems to be a cyclical discourse on the use of trigger warnings in books. For whatever reason, this topic tends to get people really heated, and some people feel like the request of trigger warnings is a major affront to the author and to the very concept of literature itself. I‚Äôve also seen people state that they refuse to read books where authors have included them, and I just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt understand that stance?

I‚Äôm currently a senior medical student in the U.S., and I‚Äôm interested in specializing in neuropsychiatry. I‚Äôve gotten some good exposure to mood disorders in my training thus, so I feel like I‚Äôve developed a decent understanding on the nature of PTSD and how difficult it can be for some patients to manage (and there‚Äôs always more for me to learn, of course. Our faculty members don't call us lifelong-learners for nothing!). Because I currently hope to work in such an emotionally sensitive field, I‚Äôm really big on meeting people where they're at, approaching their needs with a sense of compassion, and trying to take time to understand why they have certain needs and how best those needs can be addressed.

Now, what does all that have to do with trigger warnings? Well, the primary purpose of trigger warnings is to inform readers of certain subject matter that will make an appearance in the book, so taht readers can make an informed decision about whether the story is appropriate for them to read. This is particularly important for folks with PTSD, because they can‚Äôt always predict what kind of physiological and/psychological reactions they have to certain topics, so they‚Äôd rather just stay safe and avoid topics that will lead to panic attacks, anxiety attacks, and other disproportionate reactions.

A less extreme example is myself: I can‚Äôt psychologically tolerate horror stories. Whenever I consume horror stories, I have increased difficulty with falling asleep (lasting at least a week or more). This is bad news for me, because I already struggle with insomnia at baseline and use several sleep aids. So‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt read horror stories. 

Now, am I probably missing out on some great horror books? Yeah, totally. 

But I don‚Äôt consider the expectation for me to consume every great story out there more important than my need for a good night‚Äôs rest. Any doctor you know will tell you that medical school can be very energy-draining, and my body every minute of sleep it can get, so I‚Äôm more than happy to eliminate anything that interferes with my sleep/my ability to fall asleep, even at the cost of missing out on a good book. I wish this wasn‚Äôt the case, but I‚Äôm not going to suffer through sleepless nights just so I can have some kind of street cred in saying that I read horror books. I'm a big proponent of self-care, and I don't want to spend every day of my life feeling sleep-deprived, so I do what I gotta do. Sue me, I guess.

Now, for some rebuttals to common arguments against trigger warnings:

* ***‚ÄúTrigger warnings spoil the story!‚Äù***

They really don‚Äôt. They're just vague warning about the broad subject matter, not a detailed description of the exact way that the topics manifest in the story and which characters they affect. They can be styled it like the viewer discretion messages at the beginning of visual media, which, to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever had an issue over spoilers with.

* ***‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt predict everything that will trigger someone!‚Äù***

And you're absolutely right. Good thing the only expectation surrounding trigger warnings is to include obvious/major/common-sense ones (eg. rape, suicide, domestic violence) and not necessarily everything under the sun. 

Now, will there be some people with some really niche triggers? Absolutely. Will there be unreasonable people who get mad at the author for not being aware of their specific existence, and not having intimate knowledge of a stranger's niche trigger? sure. But just because *some* people will have unreasonable reactions to this topic doesn't necessarily mean that we should forego the idea all together. 

* ***‚ÄúTrigger warnings dissuade people from engaging with topics that challenge them!‚Äù***

The people for whom trigger warnings are important are typically not using them because they have something against literature that challenges them. They‚Äôre usually doing it because certain topics can trigger disproportionate physiological/psychological reactions that are hard to predict and difficult to control, so they‚Äôre avoiding these topics as part of the management of their mental well-being. There‚Äôs nothing wrong or shameful about prioritizing your psychological health over a theoretical need to ‚Äòchallenge yourself‚Äô, and there are plenty of books that readers can use to ‚Äòchallenge‚Äô their ethics/philosophies/critical thinking without needlessly forcing themselves to endure additional mental trauma. A challenge doesn't need to be traumatizing in order to be a challenge. 

* ***‚ÄúI write books for adults. Adults should be able to handle any topic no problem!‚Äù***

Adults are not a monolith, and the cognition and psychology of every adult differs. Not all of them have the emotional/mental capacity to handle certain topics and still feel well afterwards, and their decision to not engage with these topics doesn‚Äôt make them any less adult. In fact, I consider it quite mature to have the self-awareness needed to recognize that you have psychological limitations regarding certain subject matter. I suspect that the world would be a much better place if more adults were willing and/or able to self-reflect on their psyche. 

Additionally, informed decision-making is a professional standard for many fields, and I view trigger warnings as being akin to that: you‚Äôre giving adult readers the info they need to make informed decisions about the stories they consume, and whatever decision they ultimately come to is their business. If you genuinely feel like they are going to suffer consequences from avoiding their triggers, then those consequences are also their business. You can't claim that trigger warnings is 'babying readers' and then simultaneously baby readers from whatever outcomes result from their decision to not engage with a certain story. I'm also yet to see any proof that avoiding serious psychological triggers leads to significant decline in literacy and other negative outcomes, but I'm open-minded, so if you've got any sources for me to check out, I am all ears. 

* ***‚ÄúThe only way to overcome your fears is by confronting them. Avoiding them gives them more power/makes you weak, etc.‚Äù***

This particular argument is extremely arrogant. It's really not your place to force certain types of fear-management methods onto others. Not only can every fear *not* be effectively managed with repeat exposure, but even when exposure therapy is done for things like phobias and some manifestations of PTSD, the therapy is typically done in a structured and controlled environment in the presence of qualified professionals. Why? Because said professionals understand that the triggering of certain traumas can sometimes be severe and require elevated management. Therefore, I think it‚Äôs inappropriate and a little callous to just casually tell people to ‚Äòfix‚Äô their PTSD with repeat exposure, as if that treatment is just a cute little magic trick that can fix anything. For casual phobias, this might not be that big of a deal, but for people with PTSD and other trauma-based disorders, it can become serious. Therefore, I think that people should be a little more mindful of just casually suggesting exposure therapy to everyone like it's no big deal.

* ***‚ÄúIf people avoid certain books because of trigger warnings, they‚Äôll miss out on great books!‚Äù***

Please. I‚Äôve seen people avoid books for far less: unappealing covers, specific tropes that they don't like, seeing the genre as being inherently inferior (eg. adult fantasy readers turning their nose up at YA fantasy, people turning their nose up at Romance/romantasy), the author being a woman/a person of color/part of the LGBTQ+ community/having a specific political alignment/etc., using certain details about the book to come to the premature conclusion that the story is 'woke trash', etc. 

Not to mention how subjective the word ‚Äògood‚Äô is. What are the chances that the ‚Äògood‚Äô books you swear that everyone needs to read are universally considered to be good? Even the classics and the ‚Äògreat authors‚Äô of our current generation have people who think that they're a waste of time, so it‚Äôs very possible that even if a reader were to ignore the trigger warning, the book would still not have been worth reading. 

It‚Äôs also worth noting that not every assessment of a trigger warning results in a decision to not read the book. Sometimes, the trigger warnings are used as a chance for the reader to mentally prepare themselves to consume that kind of story. They‚Äôll still read the book anyway, but when the difficult subject matter comes up, they‚Äôll be prepared to handle it. 

* ***‚ÄúI hate trigger warnings so much, and I avoid books that contain them!‚Äù***

If you complain that people who avoid books because of triggers are missing out on good books, but then you also say that you refuse to read certain books just for having the warnings, then ‚Äòhypocritical‚Äô is the only appropriate term to use here.

I also cannot emphasize enough how much you don‚Äôt need to read the trigger warnings if *you* personally don‚Äôt want to.  Getting angry at the trigger warning just for merely being there seems a little silly to me, and looking down on authors for being courteous enough to include them seems even sillier. Trigger warnings are there for the people who need them. If you don‚Äôt need them, great! Just flip the page and start reading the book. It doesn‚Äôt need to be this complicated. After all, you also don‚Äôt need every allergy warning that‚Äôs on a food box or every epilepsy warning in a music performance video, but you accept their presence there because you have the discernment needed to understand that some people *do* need them, and that their presence yields a net benefit with very minimal harm (if any).

TL;DR - Mental health continues to be stigmatized/not taken seriously. Trigger warnings are here to help readers make informed decisions about the content they consume. The visceral anger towards the concept of trigger warnings feels inappropriate for that their intended purpose is.

I have a feeling that the comments under this post might turn into a shit show, so forgive me in advance if I‚Äôm not able to reply to everyone. And to the user who's inevitably going to make a wisecrack about ""what if I personally get triggered by trigger warnings? üòèüòèüòè""......allow me to inform you in advance that this joke is not nearly as clever as you think it is.

What is required, I think, is learning more about both the author and their environment.  What was life and society like where they lived? What books were popular at the time?

Of these, about 12 were from my personal purchases (physical books and audiobooks), while about 40 came from the library.  So let that sink in, a normal book costs $10 to $15, but I'll assume each book costs $20 because I also borrow textbooks, which are more expensive than ordinary books. So, 40 books at $20 each equals $800. This means I save about $800 a year because of the library. But if I calculate the total number of books I borrowed from the library, both finished and unfinished, I checked my loan history and found that I borrowed about 120 books. That would cost $2,400. So, the library helps me save a lot of money. Now, Youtube, podcasts, audiobooks, ps5, ps4 ,Nintendo Switch consume much of my time.

I am not going to name the book I was reading but only to say it was written by Michael Connelly. This was a few weeks ago.

Anyhow I was quite impressed and talking about the book with some people online. Was having a chat with someone online who called themselves a ""veteran mystery reader"" and they had read the same book. But unlike me, they had been able to guess the ending and that said the twists did not surprise them except one. 

I was impressed by this person's intelligence, but they said that it was actually because the book was not that good at all. Like the one twist that surprised them was basically because the author ""cheated,"" and misled the reader by holding back vital information. So that if you go back and read over what was written, the clues you needed to see the twist coming weren't there. 

So I was thinking about that book again today and decided to make a post to see what experienced mystery readers would consider books that are full of twists but they're done very well. Like if you go back and read it over again, you can see the clues and you don't feel cheated. but despite your experience, you did not guess right and was pleasantly surprised by the twists and ending.

"1g93wzl","Defending Cozy Fiction","Recently I‚Äôve got into the habit of reading cozy fantasy ‚Äì relaxing stories without violence and with little to no stakes. Travis Baldree, Becky Chambers etc.

I find cozy fiction to be a most welcomed break from reality, as well as from the traditional narratives of popular fiction: action, crime, mystery etc. It is understandable in that regard, that many people may find cozy fiction boring or pointless, because, why read a story that has no obstacles or action?

But I‚Äôd like to defend cozy fiction in that regard. We live in a world that is constantly moving, most of us in first-world capitalist societies, where the hunt for opportunities and for a better life is constant, and ends up eating people from the inside. Combine this with the various threats of modern life, like political polarization, climate crisis, social and economic instability, a crushing work culture, and I believe it is pretty understandable why people turn to a book like *Legends & Lattes* to relax and spend their evening.

Action and drama are great, but coziness and calmness should also be part of our daily lives and our reading culture. It is why many people play Minecraft or watch Miyazaki‚Äôs films. A story doesn‚Äôt need to have great action and/or violence to be compelling. Sometimes is better to take a step back and enjoy the small things in life: drinking a coffee at your favorite caf√©, reading a book you like, or going in a stroll through the woods with your robot friend while talking philosophy. Our lives tend to be quite action packed and stressful ‚Äì there‚Äôs no need for the entirety of our fiction to be the same.

Today cozy fiction represents a generally small part of the overall literary world I believe, and I hope it will expand in the years to come. We‚Äôve seen enough stories about war, violence and apathy. It‚Äôs time to hear stories about sunshine, peacefulness and empathy. Because a human being usually needs both in order to properly exist in a civilized society, and we have given too much room to the first one. ¬†¬†¬†¬†","2024-10-21 23:22:32 UTC",195

I'm currently reading a new release from a TikTok personality that had a pitch that sounded fun, especially for Halloween, but it's SO let down by the lack of editing or even cohesive flow. The characters smirk, shrug, sigh and slouch so often it sounds like they have physical tics. 

Another release hyped up last year was The Butcher and the Wren, from Morbid cohost Alaina Urqhart, which apparently never had a single critical eye passed over it. It's genuinely one of the worst books I've ever read, the prose and pacing is sloppy and again- barely cohesive. 

Then of course there's the most notable lemon of all that inexplicably gained enough traction to be picked up by a trad pub - Gothikana. Apparently written by Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, it's like an AI generated text but I wouldn't even give the author enough credit, and it seemed to have absolutely no overhaul before being published. 

There are definitely outliers here- for example All Good People Here is another podcast host author but was much tighter, not full of nonsense passages and irrelevant arm flailing, huffing or smirking.

"1g71d0w","Babel","Let me summarize nearly 800 pages for you: ""colonialism, racism, and sexism are all bad, and were especially bad in 1830s England with the added bonus of classism at Oxford.""

That's it, that's the whole book.

I should have followed my gut around 100-150 pages in when I was thinking ""surely the entire book is not this hamfisted, right?"". No, it is. And I won't even touch on the suspension of disbelief necessary for this argentogravure stuff. Like the entire world is normal, except that? At least with Harry Potter you're allowed to believe the world exists because it's entirely magic, but here it's just this? It didn't resonate.

Back to my main gripe: if you want to be hit over the head every 40 pages or so with ""colonialism bad"", then by all means take the dive. But what did this book teach me that I didn't already know? It's set in 1830s Oxford...of course there are racists, sexists, and classists, and of course these things are bad. What did this explore that hasn't been explored? There was zero subtlety in the entire thing. I felt like I was reading a long form post from r/im14andthisisdeep or something.

The characters were also somehow not believable at all. The only one that felt believable and well written was Ramy.

I've read plenty more that had more to say on the main topics that this book supposedly deals with. Le Pays des Autres comes to mind, also Le Paradis, hell even Where the Crawdads Sing had more to say about class than this and that too was pretty on the nose.

I bought this because the review said it was an exploration of class, race, etc. in a novel setting. It was, instead, nearly 800 pages of being beat over the head with things we already know against a backdrop of a completely absurd plot to which no real effort is given to explain aside from maybe 5 pages like halfway through: ""slight differences in meaning impute what is missing to the surroundings"".

The writing is beautiful and despite its age, the format somehow makes it feel more modern. I guess I had always assumed Dracula would be cheesy and outdated, probably because some of the film adaptations are, well, exactly that.","2024-10-18 19:52:51 UTC",195

**'Under the spreading chestnut tree**

**I sold you and you sold me--'**

What do you do?","I know the frequent (and not bad) advice is to drop books that aren't engaging you, but I feel like it's more nuanced than that, and particularly when you're at or beyond the halfway point. For example I'm in the middle of a book I bought and paid for (used, but still). I don't hate it by any means, but whenever I pick it up on a lunch break at work or during downtime at home, I only manage a few pages before my mind wanders and I set it down again.

Do other people just drop the book at this point? Dedicate an afternoon and plow through it? Skim pages until it's either interesting or it's over? This one's relatively short, but the longer the book the more difficult the dilemma in my experience.

Edit: For the curious, the book I'm having this dilemma with is [Ice, by Anna Kavan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636223.Ice). I was excited to start it, but...well, you've read the rest of this post lol","2024-10-17 23:05:21 UTC",524

As someone who wasn‚Äôt raised in a two-language household, I read some books in German (B2/C1) for the challenge/maintenance of language and expansion of vocab. However, I *choose* these books depending on their subject matter and the author‚Äôs writing style.

Some of them for me are:

* Harry Potter- Had so many life lessons without being preachy for a middle schooler- courage, loyalty, friendship, etc.
* A Thousand Splendid Suns- Cried so much in this book. Saw the toll that wars takes on Women's Rights and Freedoms. Was so beautiful to read about the transformation of the women's feelings from being wary and hostile to becoming best of confidantes.
* Secret Seven/ Famous Five- Pure childhood nostalgia. Loved the description of the picnics and food and adventures lol
* Pride and Prejudice/ Wuthering Heights- Self explanatory. What wouldn't I do to be able to experience the feelings for the first time again that Mr. Darcy and Heathcliff evoked in the teenaged me.

For me as an ESL reader, I can honestly say there are a lot author I am struggling with even though i have been using english since I was a teenager. So, It's not easy me for to get recommendations because there are always a chance that the writing styles while feel normal to everyone else, end up much harder for me.

There was this novel particularly i want to point out. Somebody recommended the book on a post in a horrorlit subreddit and the premise intigued me. Usually with horror the writing styles are not very hard, but with this book (The Dead Path) made me quit after like 10 pages because it's nearly unreadable to me.

Excerpt from the book posted by a goodreads commenter:

*""Nicholas got inside and twisted the car alive. The bones of a city don't change. Perhaps its skin grows tight or flaccid as suburbs grow fashionable of become declassee; crow's feet spread from pockets--new streets, new arteries into fresh corpulence. But the skeleton of its founding roads, the blood of its river, the skull of the low mountain that looms over it with its thorny crown of television towers like its own blinking Calvary...these things hadn't changed.""*

It's not like I dont understand them at all, I do eventually,  but it caused me to read sentences multiples times and slow down, and its hard to get absorbed into the story.

For me this is the biggest barrier in reading novels because i cannot just choose whatever topic and story I am interested about. Do you guys had the same experience? Which author caught you off guard?

I'm a UK teacher prepping TKAM for the first time. I have mixed feelings about the book but at the moment I have to teach it so I just want to do a good job. I would love someone with better background knowledge than me to just give a little feedback on these points. Thank you so much.

1. I'm really interested in poverty in the book as a social ill alongside racism. Is it fair to say that poverty in the South in the Depression was traceable back to the Civil War and Reconstruction as well as the Depression itself? The American Civil War is not widely taught here in the UK and I don't think this is on many teachers' radars, but the fact of Alabama being on the ""losing"" side and the collective memory of the Civil War seem quite relevant to the book.
2. To what extent am I right in thinking this is partly a ""giving voice to the voiceless"" type of book? From the viewpoint of 1960s America it might have been easy for some readers to dismiss a poor, racism-ridden town in Depression Alabama as beneath their worldview. Is it fair to tell students that in fact Lee is trying to crack open this image and present a three-dimensional view of the time and place?
3. One of the themes in the book seems to be that the apparatus of government -- education, the courts -- is faulty and does a poor job of people's actual lives. It isn't equal to the social problems on the ground. Is it fair to say this reflects a deeper mistrust between disadvantaged people and the state?

Would love any comments on these ideas. Thank you!

The breakdown of all the tropes to be found in the book really makes me lose a lot of interest in it, to be honest.

"1fzz7wt","Is Mr Darcy just the fantasy of the emotionally unavailable man?","I am definitely new to this subject so very curious what the general assessment is on this. 

But Darcy, to me in my late 30s, comes across as a man who is ‚Äúemotionally unavailable‚Äù and whose sudden interest becomes overwhelmingly flattering because he seems so hard to get. Then the emotions run high with constant conflict during courtship stirring up a lot of sexual tension. So that by the time they actually come together there‚Äôs a lot of emotional attachment but based more on drama than actual compatibility. 

The story ends there with a happily ever after, and I won‚Äôt say he and Elizabeth aren‚Äôt compatible but I do wonder if once the excitement cools, his more unpleasant qualities turn towards Elizabeth. She‚Äôs free and outspoken and he is more reserved and controlled. I could see him being a controlling partner or at least a major stuck in the mud. 

That said, Elizabeth‚Äôs options of men seem to be timelessly relatable: the good guy who‚Äôs not an option, the weird jerk, the nice guy who‚Äôs actually a jerk, and the jerk with the golden heart. 

Is Darcy‚Äôs golden heart just a hopeful projection that fades after the chase?

UPDATE: first of all, I just watched the Matthew McFadyen movie and can see why so many people have the perspectives they do about Darcy. 

I really love this conversation and am excited to finally be initiated into the lore. 

Based on just the book I do still feel like this is optimistic ‚Äúdiamond in the rough‚Äù fantasy like any early Disney fairytale. And I love these fantasies. But I think this book really nails the female perspective. 

Elizabeth seems to change her perspective upon learning more about Darcy. But Darcy‚Äôs perceived changes seem directed by selfish interests. His treatment of Elizabeth and his meddling in his friend‚Äôs relationship only changes when he takes a personal interest in Elizabeth, however earnest that may be. Alas, in the book, he‚Äôs the real deal and truly seems to grow. But my point is that in reality I think these scenarios end up painful and disappointing for the ‚ÄúElizabeth‚Äù.

And I've seen the inverse - dull characters, weak or nonexistent motives, bland plots - but the prose is beautiful. It can paint a great picture in my head, it just doesn't end up being a particularly memorable one. 

Will you keep reading in either of these circumstances?

For me, I can definitely power through *some* bad prose for a good story. And the better the story, the more I'm willing to put up with. But if a book doesn't hook me or drag me in, I don't care how flowery or captivating the descriptions are, or how wonderfully written it is - I just can't force myself to continue when I don't care what happens.","2024-10-09 17:14:18 UTC",205

I was reading it in a kindle, and it was a pdf. 

I was at around 50% completion of the novel according to the kindle, and was thinking, man what a book where is it going to go from here? This fees so final.

Then the book ended, and I realized the other half of the pdf were academic papers and reviews on White Noise.

It was a bizarre experience reading a novel without a proper context of when the end is, something impossible to do with a physical book.

It had changed my framing of all of the events of the story, where what I imagined as the middle portion was actually the finale.

"1fzj0pi","Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua was one of my more disappointing reads of the year.","Wow, this book made me angry. It also made me really sad, and also even more conflicted about my own experience being raised in an Asian family. 

For those not in the know, this is a book by corporate lawyer and writer Amy Chua about her experience raising her two daughters in the ""traditional"" Chinese style - with academic and musical success, obedience, drive, and SUCCESS (oh, did I say that already?) being valued over all else. It's basically a memoir-style work detailing the most extreme form of ""tiger parenting.""

I read it out of curiosity (and to admit, maybe to see if I could find some of my own mother's voice in Chua's book?) and ended up with more than a few gripes. 

* First, the book was published at the wrong time. I think it could have been a lot more insightful if it was published after her children actually grew into adults. The so-called conclusion of the book includes her still-teenager daughters assuring her that they appreciated the way they were raised, and considered it a net positive. I don't know about you, but to me age 14 doesn't seem like the ideal time to get this opinion. It being published later would also give Chua more years to think and maybe make it possible for her to have one single self-reflective point throughout the entirety of the book.
* That sort of brings me into point 2. What is Chua even trying to say with this book? It kind of just seems provocative for the sake of provocation. Okay, you had your child practice for ten hours a day for ten years. You screamed, smashed glasses, never let your child pick extracurricular activities or have friends - at some point it just becomes *we get it.* What did you *learn?* What did you conclude about parenting? Do you think you did the right thing? It was a lot more ""here are some anecdotes about my children! I yelled a lot"" rather than the reflective POV I was expecting. I feel like Chua knew her book would be shocking to a Western audience and just leaned into that rather than make any effort to make her book meaningful.
* Finally, I feel like the most important thing to recognize about this book is that we're hearing about Amy Chua's parenting ""success"" because ultimately, her kids were able to survive it. Something I think not a lot of people want to acknowledge is that children actually are different - not in the ""everybody's special"" kind of way, but more matter-of-factly - some children are less able to handle pressure than others. Some are less intelligent, less driven, more prone to distraction. Some children are Yoon-seoks. (There is an anecdote in the book in which Chua's older daughter, Sophia, comes in second to a boy named Yoon-seok on a multiplication test. In response, Chua has Sophia drill multiplication for hours and hours until she comes in first every time for the rest of the year.) But what if Yoon-seok's parents were jut as invested in success as Chua? But no matter how much they drilled him, he just couldn't beat that other girl in his math class? What happens when it's not a math test, but he just can't beat her out for valedictorian, or that Harvard spot, or that job offer? According to Chua's parenting style, he'll be ""motivated"" by being called garbage every time. Maybe he turns out fine - just second place. Or maybe he becomes a maladjusted adult with anger issues, develops a drinking problem, enters a string of abusive relationships, engages in some combination of these, or just kills himself. And his story will never be told - it'll be ""shameful"" and hidden forever.

But there were some interesting questions I thought this book raised too. Is parenting simpler than Chua's making it? Can you leave your children to make decisions for themselves, just support them, and have them turn out fine? Or is it actually *more* complex than she says, and there's some kind of magical balance that needs to be struck? And what should we tolerate within the Asian community? How much of what Westerners consider ""abuse"" should we accept as part of our culture? None of it? Part of it? What parts? Why do Westerners get to define ""default"" parenting and Asian parenting is the deviation?

I'm still in high school, and have next to no experience when it comes to child-rearing, so I don't expect to get answers to these anytime soon, but I do wonder about it - especially when I catch myself thinking  about how to make sure my children will be in the highest reading group at school without also having them tearing up in the school bathroom over an ""In progress"" grade. I thought Chua might come up with something in over 200 pages, but she seemed more occupied with recitals & shock value.","2024-10-09 04:07:21 UTC",170
"1fz9dgg","The marketing shift from ""Philosopher's"" to ""Sorcerer's"" stone was a bad faith move","I've heard the rumor for years that the first HP book's title was changed essentially because publishers thought American kids were too dumb to know what a philosopher was. 

But back in 1998, most of us that young (8-12ish) reading books that big would have had no problem with the word ""Philosopher."" And it wasn't as if ""sorcerer"" was really a big part of our standard lexicon either. 

So was it really the reason? If so, it seems like that they didn't really know their target audience. But that doesn't surprise me since most people (especially in the (US) don't give kids enough credit.

Sal and his friends are just always off seeking another adventure. For the most part they‚Äôre kind of just sleazy guys trying to skirt responsibility. Which I think is the point? That the ‚Äúon the road‚Äù lifestyle is hedonistic fun but fleeting and also damaging to your morality?

The general themes and premise were interesting but after 200 pages of Kerouac describing parties and sweating and cars, it just started to turn into a slog where it felt like everything was being beat over your head over and over again.

"1fxo060","Have you ever re-read a favourite book from your childhood and been astounded by a layer you didn't see as a kid, or by something that you now see in a new way?","I'm definitely a re-reader, and will often choose books from my childhood to enjoy again. I love going back to a world that's had an impact on me (part nostalgia, part just what my particular reader-imagination craves!)

In re-reading a few Judy Blume books - namely Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, Superfudge, and Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great - I  find myself literally astounded at how deftly Blume portrays adult characters, despite them being secondary characters who remain mostly ""in the wings"" of the main story. As a kid, I accepted what the adults did and said as a matter of course - and I think that's what her young central characters do, too.

But now as an adult, I can see and feel the adults' midlife crises, career angst, complicated financial decisions, dynamics with extended family and other parents... These are not know-it-all grown ups, nor are they bumbling, clueless types where the kids know best. They are living, breathing, flawed (sometimes humorously), loving ""whole"" people. And again, what impresses me most  - especially when reading now - is how Blume does not write pages and pages about any of the above and none of it with a heavy hand; these details are simply what come through in little snippets of action and effortless dialogue as the young characters go about their kid-centric lives.

So I'd love to know: what childhood books look different to you - and how so - when you read them in adulthood?","2024-10-06 19:01:18 UTC",357

Also, lots of spoilers.

I expected quite a lot more from this book, but I couldn't even bring myself to finish it.

I checked a few spoiler-free reviews before, and they were all 5 stars. Not sure how that is possible.

The story promises a lot from the very beginning. The secret life of a Marilyn Monroe-like celebrity... All the sordid details and secrets of her life... A story worth 12 million dollars... But all of that amounts to a generic, boring, and poorly-paced story.

The introduction to Monique is fine, albeit cliche. Struggling writer who wants to climb to the top. Heard all of that before. Nothing really exciting there.

The mystery of Evelyn Hugo on the other hand is well introduced. Who is she? Why did she marry 7 times? Why does she want to meet Monique?

And then she starts telling her story, and nothing she ever says is ground-breaking.

Her childhood was quickly skipped. She mentions her dreams of becoming famous, making her mother proud and leaving her abusive father.

All of that is fine, but it seems that the author forgot the most important rule of story-telling: SHOW DON'T TELL.

We never see any of the bad stuff. And not just that, a few pages later, she's married and ready to leave Hell's Kitchen. WHAT??? YOU'RE GONNA SKIP YOUR CHILDHOOD JUST LIKE THAT???

Where was the struggle? Why should I care about you, Evelyn? It didn't really sound like you went through much. You're just another Mary Sue.

Edit:

Yes, a Mary Sue. And there are several types of Mary Sue. It's not just someone who is flawless. It can be someone who is good at everything. Or someone for whom characters behave differently and reality bends to meet their needs. And that's exactly what happens throughout Evelyn's life. One day she is single and hopeless, the next day she's met a gullible guy who agrees to take her somewhere else. None of that happens so quickly in the real world. And even if it does, Evelyn finds a ways to make all of this sound plain and boring.

And BTW, a Mary Sue doesn't necessarily have to be a bad character. The fact that she is a Mary Sue is irrelevant. Like I said, the problem is that she doesn't ever delve into details. We only get a surface level story.

End edit.

She then starts her career as an actress in the most generic way possible. As a waitress who meets a producer at whatever place she was. And not just that, she did it again in just a few pages.

Again, WHERE WAS THE STRUGGLE YOU OVERCAME???

She quickly becomes a famous movie star with a rising career in just a few pages.

WHERE WAS THE STRUGGLE???

Edit:

I'm not saying that there needs to be a struggle. What I mean by this is that Evelyn has given us the very condensed version of her story and she's left out anything that would make it relatable or interesting.

End edit.

She starts dating and eventually marries Don, who turns out to be a terrible human being.

This is where it actually got good for a moment, and I finally felt like the story was gonna get interesting.

The scene of the first time he attacks her is very well done. This is what I wanted to see. You're finally SHOWING us that you did struggle. That the life of movie star is not just glamour and happiness.

The problem comes next. The book had been so completely rushed as of that point, that I felt the change in pacing 10 times more annoying than it should've been. Evelyn's previous divorce was SO fast that it felt only natural that she would divorce Don a few pages later, but the story just kept dragging on and on and on... for several hours.

It really was tedious to read about their marriage. The whole time I was thinking, why hasn't she divorced him yet? You claim to be smart and manipulative, but you're being really dumb now. The book hasn't given us any reason for which you can't divorce him other than the fact that staying with him keeps the cameras on you, which is a lame reason.

And yes, I know she claims to be in love for the first time in her life, but none of that shows in the pages! Their relationship is as dull as can be. Dancing a little bit and eating at restaurants. REALLY EVELYN??? 12 MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS GARBAGE???

Her relationship with Celia was also rushed. They had one or two good scenes together that were good but not great. I started to like Celia a bit, but the romance felt forced because it didn't have time to grow. Like I said, ONLY 1 or 2 good sexually charged scenes together and then made them a couple? No, that's not enough!

The best chemistry between couples comes from waiting and getting to know each other. We don't even know enough about Celia to care about her character. All we know is that she is obsessed with Evelyn. AND THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!

Her friendship with Harry was also boring at best (to be fair, all the characters are boring). He was there for emotional support, but it never really felt like he mattered. He offered to help many times, but he never really did anything important. He felt nothing more than like an extra in a movie.

And then we FINALLY get to the divorce. And the story can FINALLY continue.

A new problem is introduced, and as always, Evelyn solves it effortlessly and without any struggle. Her career is saved in just a few pages because she landed a role in an international film.

Wow. Exciting, isn't it? No. Not really.

At this point she's proven she can do anything the plot needs her to do. So why should I care if her career was momentarily ruined for 20 minutes?

Her marriage to Mick was another sort of exciting point in the story, but I was so numb at that point that I didn't care much for it.

And then I finally decided to DNF the book. I'm halfway through it, and there's no sign it will get any better. I could've finished it, but I see no point in doing that. It's only mediocre at best.

I read a quick summary just to know if the promised twist would be good enough to hook me again, but it's not. It's as generic as can be.

I will say though that I'm disappointed in myself for not having figured it out. I had several theories, but I wasn't able to deduce why she specifically wanted Monique to write her book.

Edit: I appreciate the people who are both offering to tell me the ending of the book or doing so. But, as mentioned in the post, I already read a summary to see if it was worth revisiting. So, yes, I already know about Monique's father. Still, I don't feel it changes anything about my opinions on this book.

Edit 2: Thanks for the nice comments! Only a few people say I demand too much from this book. As if demanding good writing, better characterizations, and better pacing was unreasonable. It's the minimum we should expect from any book.

I will say though that I read Jennette McCurdy's I'm Glad my Mother Died last year, and it's really increased my standards in historical fiction (even though it's non-fiction). And I think it's valid to compare them because they are both, for the most part, autobiographies of famous hollywood stars.

And let's not forget that from the very beginning, Evelyn tells Monique that she wants her to write her life story. So, the fact that Evelyn is unable to speak like a real person, provide details like a real person, or tell stories that feel real and not made up shows how little mastery in writing the author has.

If that was a 10, this is a 2. And if anyone had told me this was written by AI, I would have believed it because the story lacks depth and characterization. We only see the surface level of Evelyn's life, and it feels like the first draft of a story rather than a finished product.

But hey, if you enjoyed this book, I'm glad. Obviously, no one likes to be in the minority that dislikes something, but it sometimes happens.","2024-10-04 19:52:12 UTC",140

Most recently, James, by Percival Everett. I've tried to get out of these situations a few times politely but they seemed offended, as if I don't respect them or their opinion. They know i'm not busy but don't understand I'm not as disciplined and productive as they are. Like I'm not always motivated to read. Sometimes I rather watch an old sitcom.

Anyhow so on a couple of occasions I've lied and said I did read the book. To back up my claim, I looked up details summaries of said books. I feel bad but can't find a better solution to it.

I've also had the opposite experience, where I say I read a particular book but people don't believe me. The problem is I don't have a good memory so I can only remember details of a book I've read in the last few weeks. Then I forget.

For example, a friend who just read Pride and Prejudice asked me what I thought of George Wickham, but I just couldn't remember who he was. At the time we had that conversation, I had read the book a year ago (for the second time in fact) but embarrassingly couldn't remember several important characters and their stories, other than important parts of what happened between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy (what was his first name?).

Anybody else relate or am I alone in this?","2024-10-03 23:53:39 UTC",348

The main character makes a deal with a primordial god which condemns her to not just immortality, but to never be remembered by anyone. And you see her life switching from events during the past and the present day. It is an absolute masterpiece.

"1fuh9ci","Reading my first John Updike, kinda skeeved out by it.","I‚Äôve never read any John Updike before, but I have read a ton of what I would consider ‚Äúdude lit,‚Äù even though I‚Äôm a straight woman. I love Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Philip Roth, Don Delillo, Bret Easton Ellis, etc. But this John Updike guy? I just don‚Äôt know about him. 

I‚Äôm reading The Villages, which maybe isn‚Äôt a great place to start, but I just really don‚Äôt like how Updike writes about women and sex. It‚Äôs like he has no empathy for his female characters, at all, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre just sex-puppets to him. And this is coming from someone who loves Bret Easton Ellis! Who has sawed his female characters in half! Hemingway, who has knocked up several poor long-suffering nurses and abandoned them! Steinbeck, who has given us so many drunken louts who let down the women in their lives. 

I don‚Äôt know why Updike‚Äôs suburban, milquetoast misogyny bothers me so much! I guess it‚Äôs this pervasive belief that his characters seem to have that women are so ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù so ‚Äúexotic and unknowable.‚Äù It‚Äôs like, they are just women, like, half the people on the planet, like your own mom and sister. Why does he write about them like they are another species? 

I was going to read Rabbit, Run, but now I‚Äôm just too skeeved out. Does it handle its female characters well? Is it worth reading? Thanks! ","2024-10-02 14:17:16 UTC",296

"1fu2djc","How long do you wait for the next book in the series?","I've noticed with some of the new authors I'm reading that there's different ranges of when the next book of the series between them. Some are popping out books as soon as 3 months after the first book is published. Some are 6-7 months and others are a year between books. Growing up reading Rick Riordan I hated having to wait a whole year for the next book to come out because I would read them so quick. But as I got older while reading them I knew I was getting the best quality of storytelling in the book in the time it took to be written.

It seems like some authors today the first book of the series isn't even out yet before they are making a post of how they are working on book 2 and then you blink and they are promoting book 2 when book 1 hasn't even been out that long.  If the author and series is good and keeps me hooked then 6/7 months and even a year between books isn't bad for me. But I'm 50/50 about books that come out so quick it's like is this going to be the author's best work on this book.

How soon do you like having the next book in the series published? How long do you wait for the next book before you forget about it and loose interest? If it goes past a year would you even read it or be like I'm done with the series it's taking to long for the books to come out?

"1ftrj84","ü¶áüéÉSpooky Season Is Upon Us!! What Are Your Reading Plans?üéÉüëª","It's October 1st and Spooky Season has officially begun! Every year since 2017, I have made a tradition of planning my Spooktober reads several months in advance. Usually the books are a mix of horror and gothic fiction, with the occasional seasonally appropriate mystery. I often like to get an anthology of traditional horror/gothic/ghost short stories in there as well. 

I find it exciting to plan and go hunting for spooky books in the lead up. The anticipation as Fall draws near is such a rush! And now here we are, Spooktober is here!

My Spooktober 2024 Reads:

- **The Elementals by Michael McDowell (1981)** - I started my spooky reads a little early, actually, and read this in the last week of September. I just finished it last night. It's a short southern gothic haunted house novel. I really enjoy a good haunted house story, so I've had this recommended to me a lot of the years. Decided to finally give it a go, though it wasn't *quite* what I was hoping for. It was still a good read though and definitely a talented author when it comes to creating an uncanny atmosphere. I will probably reread it at some point because I think part of the problem was my own mindset.

- **Clown in a Cornfield 2 - Frendo Lives by Adam Cesare (2022)** - Just started this and expecting good fun! Read and enjoyed the first book last spooky season.

- **The Carrow Haunt by Darcy Coates (2018)** - another haunted house book. I've read her Haunting of Ashburn House and From Below in previous years. Really liked Haunting of Ashburn House so thought I'd try another haunted house book by her. This one is about a house haunted by the ghost of a serial killer, from what I understand.

- **Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories (1983)** - this is my traditional horror short story collection for this season. It's a collection of Roald Dahl's favourite ghost/gothic stories by 19th/early 20th century authors. Includes some greats like A.M. Burrage, E.F. Benson, Edith Wharton, and Robert Aikman.

- **The Haunted by Bentley Little (2012)** - hadn't originally planned to read this but was an impulse buy when I was more recently browsing at a local bookstore.

- **The Monk by Matthew Lewis (1796)** - this is my traditional gothic novel for the season (usually always at least one). I've been meaning to read it for a while now so excited to finally get to it. 

- Potentially **The Haar by David Sodergren** - even though its high on my list, depends if I end up pulling the trigger on buying it or just going with stuff I've already got at home.

- Potentially **Pine by Francine Toon** - Scottish folk/gothic horror I've been wanting to read for a while. I do have it at home, but kind of depends on whether I end up grabbing the Haar or not, just as far as having time to read all of these this month.

- Potentially **Darkness by John Saul** - a back up if I have more time to read more books than expected this month.

- Potentially **The Gathering by C.J. Tudor** - another back up

**How about you guys?! What are you planning to read for Spooky Season this year??**","2024-10-01 15:55:58 UTC",205
"1ftqs18","Have you ever found a real gem in one of those public free book shelves/book trading places?","I just need to share this with you all since everyone here is so enthusiastic about books as well and my friends are already rolling their eyes at me, but i got really lucky last week. 
I'm currently on a cruise around Norway and when we were visiting the tourist information in the rather small town Kristiansand, there was a shelves of books for everyone to take as they please, and what do I find there between a hundred Norwegian novels? The Norton Anthology on English Literature, in English. Maybe a month ago I asked on reddit for recommendations of a collection of different Romantic poets, and as luck would have it, I find the most popular rec in one of the unlikeliest places ever. and it's in peak condition! Not too long ago, I also got Les Miserables, an edition from the 80s, in one of those telephone booths turned into book shelf, where you can take one and leave one of your own there

But any other work by her that doesn't involved that it just seems to be horrible writing wise, plot wise, characters etc it's like they are not even written by the same author. I've given her the benefit of the doubt with some of the books I've read. But it seems each one is worse than the last. After the latest book of hers that I read I really think I have to call it quits with her. Her work is too inconsistent and I'm getting more and more frustrated when reading her books. 

Usually I can tell within a book or two if I don't like an author's writing style or just don't think they're a good writer. But with her I went thru at least 5 good books before the downfall started.  How many books of an author will you read before you decide that they're just not the author for you? What do you do when you have read them for a certain amount of time and then their work becomes inconsistent leaning towards more the not so good side? ","2024-10-01 02:22:32 UTC",151

It was so fatiguing that I almost put it down a few times.   
On a brighter note, I also read Will Of The Many about a month ago which is a true linear story and it was so refreshing. Each chapter picked up right where the last one left off and i just had a blast reading it. ","2024-09-30 20:03:37 UTC",111

"1fsnypx","Books that make you feel loved, as if getting a warm hug by the fire and are surrounded by caring people.","I'd been going through a rough time and feeling invisible, alone, and alienated in a world of strangers who are just looking out for themselves.

Started looking around for books that make me feel good, and give me cozy feeling of like being loved by others and cared for. Didn't care if it'd be fiction, nonfiction, or however long, something that gives you hope and a sense that you matter to people and make you believe that life may be tough but kind people exist and can help.

Tried a couple of different types of books but wasn't able to get past the first few pages. They were either sugar-coated and dumbed down versions of reality or too self-helpy or just not to my taste.

Then I had a strange reaction to a book that is not usually considered a feel-good book: To Kill a Mockingbird. I don't know what it is, I mean like the Southern way of life, that sense of family, an intelligent and caring father who took the time to teach his children about life and important values like justice and compassion...something about it really warmed my heart. I still go back to it and feel the same warm feelings I did upon first reading it. Even though it deals with serious issues and has some unpleasant and ignorant characters too, reading it continues to be an emotional resource.

I continue my search for other books that I can go to at such difficult personal times, but I have now learned I might find them in places did not ever think to look.

Also I decided to also ask what books other people find that have similar effects.

P.S. In the meantime I've seen also a couple of other people online mentioning similar reactions to Harper's book so I'm not the only one I guess.","2024-09-30 05:06:55 UTC",517

"1fslj76","White by Bret Easton Ellis","I have never encountered anything‚Äîany book or movie or series‚Äîthat has aged so badly and so fast as White by Bret Easton Ellis.

Ellis was one of my favorite writers, who frankly peaked at a very young age. There was the numbing Less Than Zero when he was a teenager, and then of course American Psycho which was absolutely brilliant and defining and somehow was written in his twenties.

He wrote some other pretty good novels and short stories as well, but his 21st century output just hasn‚Äôt been the same. Lunar Park and The Shards, which both star fictional versions of himself, are too self-centered to ever be considered classics.

Still, I thought I‚Äôd be a completist and check out his controversial nonfiction book of essays. I have to say, I wish I hadn't.

White really starts out so promising. Ellis spends a lot of time reviewing movies and music, especially from the 80s, which seems to be among his favorite topics. He says some interesting things about being queer as well, especially in the context of film and Hollywood's evolving norms. Most of all, the background on writing Less Than Zero and then American Psycho are excellent. Very much worth reading for fans. Even the backstory of the latter‚Äôs film and yes its musical adaptation are great reads. Plenty of celebrity name-dropping for good measure.

But that‚Äôs not really the point of White. The point of this book, is to complain about the kids these days.

He doesn‚Äôt use the word woke, which wasn‚Äôt quite in fashion yet, but it‚Äôs an incredibly familiar list of complaints. Couldn‚Äôt be more cliched.

Basically, 2017 and the subsequent years since then were an annoying time and some people went overboard. We all know. And yet, this was written right before 2020 when shit got so much more serious. And it could not have aged more badly.

His premise more or less is that the MAGA movement isn‚Äôt that bad, people complained too much about the president which annoyed him (the greatest sin there is apparently), and just generally trying to normalize that awful administration.

He devotes thousands and thousands of words to this. Having read a few political books in my time, what's frustrating is how much Ellis talks about ‚Äòaesthetics‚Äô without actually caring about the policy aspects of politics whatsoever. He doesn‚Äôt have anything to say about immigration, or women‚Äôs rights, or even gay marriage or anything like that. He seems to think presidents and governments don‚Äôt do much of anything, and so all the fears the winey libs had are overblown.

Wow this aged badly after January 6. Like, he reveals how his boyfriend is a Millennial and acts like he deserves points for that‚Äîwhich is kind of problematic with the age gap actually, since when was it progressive to be 20 years older than your partner, not that I really care. He calls him a member of Generation Wuss, and has nothing to say about substantial LGBTQ+ issues of which that administration was extremely hostile.

Sure, he makes the perfunctory statements how he‚Äôs not right-wing and didn't vote for that. But the both side-ism doesn‚Äôt work, when he uses almost all his energies to complain about ‚Äúthe left.‚Äù

He keeps saying he has friends who voted Republican, how amazingly diverse his social group is, but he never says why they voted that way. There's no real argument. Politics is all an abstraction which doesn‚Äôt apparently affect anyone in real life.

Ellis mocks the term, but there‚Äôs really not other way to say it but this: He‚Äôs incredibly privileged.

Who cares that dinner parties were awkward for him because people freaked out too much? So what? There were real human beings affected by family separations at the border, and the Muslim ban, the hurricane response in Puerto Rico, trying to overturn the ACA, etc., etc.

Not to mention COVID!

And since then, Roe vs. Wade has been overturned and Project 2025 is now a viable threat and democracy is being undermined and there's a host of other serious issues. Sorry, but it turned out that his hyperventilating friends were completely correct.

Remarkably, the book ends on a note with defending Kanye West of all people. It‚Äôs nuts reading this in 2024. Like the whole ‚Äúdragon energy‚Äù take Kanye had, it‚Äôs all about the vibe, and zero about how the government functions in a way would help anyone.

And then it gets worse. He says Kanye can‚Äôt support white supremacy if he's Black, and then he defends Candace Owens and Roseanne Barr. The worst examples you could come up with. Somehow he throws James Gunn in there, without mentioning or even understanding that Gunn‚Äôs cancel moment was a right-wing smear job, and of course a lot has happened since then with the director‚Äôs resurgence because it fundamentally wasn‚Äôt the same as those other bigoted celebrities who went off the deep end and have turned out to deserve every criticism.

Bret Easton Ellis has always been an incredibly talented writer, but he should never have gotten into politics. Especially this kind of petty grievances-style blogging.

He‚Äôs become exactly what he used to satirize.

Take this quote: ‚ÄúHowever, my socialist boyfriend, whom I often accused of liberal fascism, now believed that my obsession with aesthetics had become, by the summer of 2018, essentially fascist as well.‚Äù

So if you follow that, it‚Äôs so bad that his boyfriend believed Ellis essentially a fascist. Even though he accuses his boyfriend of being a liberal fascist in the same sentence.

Which is it? Is it lame overreacting to call anyone fascists, or is it that the libs are the real fascists and that makes it okay to call them fascists?

If you haven‚Äôt noticed, this writing actually isn‚Äôt any good at all‚Ä¶

Lastly, there‚Äôs this term ‚ÄòEmpire‚Äô and ‚ÄòPost-Empire‚Äô that Ellis is fond of. I simply don‚Äôt get what the point is ultimately, what's supposed to be so great about post-Empire. What he‚Äôs really talking about is being anti-establishment, but where‚Äôs the value of being contrarian for its own sake? He never explains. All these essays and he has nothing actually political to say in the sense that politics is about policies that effect the lives of millions. And the only thing that‚Äôs a big deal, in the end, is people on Twitter vaguely making him uncomfortable sometimes.

For Bret Easton Ellis, what really matters is but the surface-level, with nothing fundamentally there, an empty tirade all focused on only‚Ä¶ the aesthetics.","2024-09-30 02:43:52 UTC",101
