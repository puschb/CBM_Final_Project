It's an international bestseller, but I wasn't expecting it to be as academic and complex as it was.  Example: multiple lines in Latin that are untranslated.

Later learned that the author deliberately and unapologetically chose to have the first 100 pages be quite difficult, as a barrier to entry for readers not worthy of his book.  Here's what he wrote about that:

>After reading the manuscript, my friends and editors suggested I abbreviate the first hundred pages, which they found very difficult and demanding. Without thinking twice, I refused, because, as I insisted, if somebody wanted to enter the abbey and live there for seven days, he had to accept the abbey's own pace.

Example: 

>For the purposes of the present essay, it is forunately not necessary to make the attempt to distinguish a specifically Harranian strain in medieval Islamic culture, let alone to suggest a solution to the mystery of what actually went on at Harran. It can treat the Arab spiritual matrix as a whole and, when sources attribute specific parts of it to the Harranians, to accept this as a contemporary belief rather than necessarily a statement of historical fact. With this position made clear, it is possible for the enquiry to get underway.

This is after fourteen pages of reviewing the historical evidence for ""What went on in Harran"" and ""What did medieval muslims think about it"". By then, I'd completely forgotten what ""the enquiry"" is because I've just spent an hour learning about the history of this one city and the various texts that mention it's people.

To find out what ""the enquiry"" is, you have to piece together several sentences from the opening of this chapter because he doesn't simply state it. The enquiry is ""*In what ways did pagan beliefs, practises, stories, images and ideas survive among the intellectual and social elites of the new monotheistic faiths of Christianity and Islam, and does this in any way reflect a survival of ancient paganism to the present?*""

I don't think it's particularly effective essay writing if you labour a point for so long the audience forgets what you were actually saying it for!

"lriu5rw","gaumeo8588","2024-10-12 04:48:46 UTC","If you’re into epic historical novels with a side of drama and intrigue, Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett is a must-read! Set in 12th-century England, this story centers around the building of a cathedral in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, but it’s so much more than just a construction story. It dives deep into the lives of a cast of characters—from builders to monks to nobility—all trying to fulfill their dreams and survive during a pretty brutal time in history.

What I loved most is how immersive it is. Follett has this amazing way of making you feel like you’re actually living in the Middle Ages, with all the grime, struggle, and beauty. Plus, the plot twists are crazy! There’s love, betrayal, revenge, and a whole lot of plotting that keeps you guessing. And despite its length (it’s a chunky book), it doesn’t drag on; there’s always something happening.

If you’re looking for a story that pulls you in and doesn’t let go, this is it. Just be ready for a wild ride through medieval England—it’s one you won’t forget anytime soon!",""

"lsgfipk","Ok-Account9401","2024-10-18 00:59:55 UTC","I think Dickens is an acquired taste, sort of like getting used to green tea or beer.  Once I got used to his prose style and mindset, I made headway and read several of his novels as an adult....not because I had to as a school assignment but because I wanted to.   He is a novelist who lives through the characters and lets them develop the plot, which is the brave approach for the writer to take.  He wrote in installments.  Once he was midway through a novel  he was asked how he was going to finish it.  He replied that he had no idea.   Jack Higgins also let the characters develop the story.   Higgins is  a page turner so there's no acquired taste there.  However,   Shakespeare is another acquired taste.  I read one of his sonnets every night.   So is the King James Version of the Bible.   It takes time to acclimate yourself to early modern English but I really prefer it to modern translations.  I've also read Chaucer in Middle English, which is virtually a foreign language and makes Shakespeare's language look easy by comparison.   I think when children grew up with the KJV of the Bible and when there wasn't TV, smartphones etc. to shorten attention spans, it was easier to focus and read more challenging prose, including that by Shakespeare.   Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott is actually a very hard read for the modern reader with lots of obscure vocabulary, yet in the 19th century it was a best seller and the average reader had no problem with it.   I loved the book.","lrh6tww"

From what I've read, a Belgian publisher paid the modern equivalent of $2.8 million for an 8-year license for the completed book without even reading it. Hugo wouldn't even reveal the length. Supposedly, if you factor in the length of the license, it's the highest figure ever paid for a work of literature.

So, based on that deal, I'm unclear why people think Hugo was paid per page.

Pretentiousness is often associated with more difficult prose.  If the prose is exceedingly elaborate it could be *pretending* that it's more meaningful or of high quality than it actually is. Which particular books are pretentious is very subjective...is Ulysses's story and themes actually justifying how fucking hard it is to read, with its multi-lingual puns, and classical and modern references jumbled together in myriad form factors?  

People usually don't consider Hemingway pretentious because his prose is very simple to read, and he doesn't seem to be relying on dubious symbolism.  

I only read one McCarthy book and I didn't find it pretentious. Certainly pretentiousness isn't relegated to just difficulty of prose.  Just like in painting or sculpture, something could be very simple (a simple painting of a hat) with dozens of journals heaping praise on it, but the average audience would be like ""I don't get it"".  There's no there there.  Like me and literally every Magritte painting.","lrhmrl8"
