To answer OP's question, I never lied about reading something. I don't think I've ever lied about that, not even in high school. 

When I was in 10th grade, we had to get a book from the school library, read it, and do a book report in like a week.  I chose Gone With the Wind (about 1000 pages).  My teacher was just so convinced that I was just going to watch the movie that she made me stand up and do my book report while she asked me a bunch of questions to try to trip me up. I did read the book. I didn't get around to watching the movie until a couple years later. I got an A on the book report.",""

Books aren't immune to that, either. Despite being a reader, some people are not quite capable of seeing that others are, at their core, different than them: that they read things at different times and paces, that they consider different things important, and that something important to one person may not be permanently memorable to another.

~~In my snarkiest moment, I'd just tell them to literally grow up, as you most clearly see the same behavior in children or others with little life experience. But everyone wants to be a spoiled gifted child nowadays, so what can you do?~~

So once I went through most of the children’s books in the library, I started reading classic literature. I was 11 years old when I read Pride and Prejudice for the very first time and it opened my eyes to a whole new world of reading, I was obsessed. 

On my first day of school that same year, my teacher wanted to have all of us get to know each other better by doing an exercise where we took turns saying our Name,Favorite color,favorite food, favorite movie, favorite book and such. When it came to my turn I answered that my favorite book was Pride and Prejudice. My teacher raised her eyebrow and said “hmm…are you sure you’ve actually read that and you’re not getting it confused with another book?”
I said “Yes Mam, I’m sure. I just read it for the first time a few months ago.”

She then proceeded to quiz me on the book and I answered her questions the best to my ability and she STILL didn’t believe I read it. She kept saying things like “Now, you know if you watched the movie on BBC it doesn’t count as reading it right? Did your mom tell you about it maybe after she read it?”

I eventually just gave up trying to convince her, but she eventually did ask my parents at a parent/teacher conference how much did I read at home to which my parents replied “we’re so proud of her reading comprehension and love for books, she’s took an interest in classic literature and loves to talk to us about it!” My parents said she acted stunned when they said that lol.",""

looking for. Following this visual trail, you have forced your way through the shop past
the thick barricade of Books You Haven't Read, which were frowning at you from the
tables and shelves, trying to cow you. But you know you must never allow yourself to be
awed, that among them there extend for acres and acres the Books You Needn't Read, the
Books Made For Purposes Other Than Reading, Books Read Even Before You Open
Them Since They Belong To The Category Of Books Read Before Being Written. And
thus you pass the outer girdle of ramparts, but then you are attacked by the infantry of the
Books That If You Had More Than One Life You Would Certainly Also Read But
Unfortunately Your Days Are Numbered. With a rapid maneuver you bypass them and
move into the phalanxes of the Books You Mean To Read But There Are Others You
Must Read First, the Books Too Expensive Now And You'll Wait Till They're
Remaindered, the Books ditto When They Come Out In Paperback, Books You Can
Borrow From Somebody, Books That Everybody's Read So It's As If You Had Read
Them, Too. Eluding these assaults, you come up beneath the towers of the fortress, where
other troops are holding out:


> the Books You've Been Planning To Read For Ages,


> the Books You've Been Hunting For Years Without Success,


> the Books Dealing With Something You're Working On At The Moment,


> the Books You Want To Own So They'll Be Handy Just In Case,


> the Books You Could Put Aside Maybe To Read This Summer,


> the Books You Need To Go With Other Books On Your Shelves,


> the Books That Fill You With Sudden, Inexplicable Curiosity, Not Easily Justified,


> Now you have been able to reduce the countless embattled troops to an array that is, to be
sure, very large but still calculable in a finite number; but this relative relief is then
undermined by the ambush of the Books Read Long Ago Which It's Now Time To
Reread and the Books You've Always Pretended To Have Read And Now It's Time To
Sit Down And Really Read Them.


> With a zigzag dash you shake them off and leap straight into the citadel of the New
Books Whose Author Or Subject Appeals To You. Even inside this stronghold you can
make some breaches in the ranks of the defenders, dividing them into New Books by
Authors Or On Subjects Not New (for you or in general) and New Books By Authors Or
On Subjects Completely Unknown (at least to you), and defining the attraction they have

There are probably quite a few books with slow/boring beginnings where that kind of writing is purposeful. Contributing factor could be that the writing style is nice once you get into the flow of it, which could take a few sections.

One of my favorite books is probably Ishiguro's *Never Let Me Go,* but I started and stopped it like 4 times before I got to the 50% mark, after which point I blew through the rest of the novel. This is one of those books that's probably a mix of the two situations from above (writing is purposefully monotonous because it adds to the sense of learned helplessness, but you also just get more accustomed to it as you read on).","lq8hess"

The other people who insist you read a certain book are the Litmus Test people.

Didn’t hurt that it’s also incredibly well done fantasy, with in my eyes some of the most fleshed-out characters I’ve read to date in a fantasy story.
 I 100% get why its length intimidates you, but *if* the story manages to hook you in, you’ll eventually find yourself at the very end of the backlog with a semi-mental breakdown, desperately begging there to be more, and soon.
