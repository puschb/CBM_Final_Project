I think it's better that way, because he's improved his writing by the second book, and got me a little invested in the character before I got to the first book.  I'm looking forward to more.

Cozy is so weird to me, because every cozy book I know of usually revolves around horrific murders, but I think the idea is that this isn't a gritty Noir detective solving the case, but the Innkeeper who spends more time with their family and some ghosts and just solves the mystery when they aren't fixing up their run-down guest house.  Even though there is tension- investigating murders is risky, especially when you don't have much in the way of backup, authority, or weaponry- but most of the book has lower stakes.

Scenes of nature/seasons, bundling up in blankets, stargazing, tea on a cool morning, lighting a fire, a warm meal, the night feeling. Any books that encapsulate these things are the kind of books that feel cozy to me.

Becky Chambers’ work is better in my opinion. Her characters are more developed, her settings are more fleshed out (and not just D&D with the trademarks filed off), and her plots, while still fairly light, actually make sense and go somewhere that isn’t trite or nonsensical. ",""

I found Treason without Tea unrealistic and not well written. It had higher stakes too.

"ls4tozj","Matzie138","2024-10-16 01:21:56 UTC","I struggle with finding good cozies.  I’m not into hard boiled procedural, I just like fun mysteries when I’m reading something like this.  

Of course, Agatha Christie novels are high on my list! Don’t miss PG Wodehouse - I think the dialog just sparkles. There’s a lot more (often sly) humor in those.  He gets a dedication in a Christie novel and supposedly played golf with Doyle.

I think my modern favorite is Alan Bradley’s Flavia De Luce series. It’s smart (I learn chemistry each time), the main character is so engaging, and it’s just fun.  The characters also grow over the course of the series, there’s maybe 13 now?

I am NOT a fan of the ridiculous recipe / murder books.  I even love puns, but if a cozy has a recipe, I’m out.  The writing generally always sucks though I’m sure I’m missing some good ones with this stance.

I was recommended the Shady Hollow series and it was fine, I don’t look for another one. It was such a fun concept but just didn’t get there in terms of character development/executing on the concept.

If you are looking for cozy-adjacent books, I’d say check out the invisible library series by Cogman. Usually shelved as sci-fi but I think it fits the cozy vibe.

Edit to add: I’m a fan of fantasy but not so much sci-fi (futuristic).  I would not describe it as a cozy at all, but rather a great mystery - Tom Sweterlisch’s The Gone World.  It’s a mystery that takes place in one time, but with their technology, they can go back to events to solve.  I checked it out from the library and then bought a copy so I could read again because I knew I missed things.",""

Which is fine in a lot of ways, especially if you’re just looking for something to do, but it becomes a problem because all of us have a different idea of what cozy means, and this version isn’t really applicable to most of us. My idea of cozy is the contrast between a warm blanket and a freezing day, so I want to be cuddled up with a disturbing, highly literary, body-horror narrative in my dressing gown. Soft and warm contrasted with horrors = cozy for me. For other people it’s Hallmark movies, or tragic romances that make you cry with your girlfriends, or their favourite childhood books.

I didn't use my local library for... 20 something years because I didn't want to do the travelling back and forth, searching shelves for books, etc. Well, I recently learned (probably very late to the game) that the library partners with different audiobook and ebook platforms. You can check the book out/place a hold, and the program even auto returns it for you when the lending period is over, all from the comfort of your own home and, of course, for free. I even signed up for my library card entirely online. Once upon a time, you had to go to your local branch with an ID and piece of mail—oh how the times have changed.

For some reason, it never clicked in my head that the library would advance its technology with the rest of the world. But anywho, if it's committing to paying for a book you may or may not like that makes you hesitate, I highly recommend seeing if your library has ebook/audiobook options. I read both Legends & Lattes and Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches on ebook through the library and have quite a few other ""cozy"" ones on hold.

For example, I find Earthsea to be a very cozy series, as the setting is arguably quite relaxed and a lot of focus is put on nature and quiet moments between action. 

That said, there is a lot of violent or unsettling scenes sprinkled in, and I would hesitate to even call the book slow. Someone else may read the series and completely disagree with my description of it as “cozy”. In short, its pretty ‘vibes based’ and generally super dependent on personal taste lol

Therefore I would argue that you should probably give other “cozy” books a chance, as it is likely the readers of that book will have a different definition of cozy to the readers of legends and lattes.",""
"ls9bcra","Cheeseanonioncrisps","2024-10-16 20:30:31 UTC","People have already addressed the relaxing element, and that's definitely part of it, but I'd also add that 'cosy' books tend to be very character driven.

One of my favourite books is The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison, about a neglected and abused kid who's unexpectedly made emperor. In a country where the Emperor has only slightly more power than the British royal family.  

There are a couple of major incidents that move the plot along, but they happen fairly far apart, and in between them we have the *actual* plot, which is literally just this guy being led around by his aides, attending dinners with ambassadors, carrying out religious rituals and trying to hobnob with the upper classes. 

The thing is, even though the story doesn't have much external action, it has a ton of internal action. The whole thing is from the Emperor's point of view and we basically get to watch as he goes from a scared kid who's way out of his depth to somebody with the ability to run a country and who has started to build strong bonds with the people around him. 

It's essentially a novel-length character study, and if you're somebody like me, whose favourite thing in fiction is character development, then it's kind of like if your favourite thing about cakes was the icing, and then somebody gave you a cake made ENTIRELY out of icing.",""

His second one *Bookshops and Bonedust* has more plot to it and it shows how much the author has grown in their writing skills.

One way to look at them is that they're not ""adventure"" novels; they're ""happily ever after"" novels. It's like relaxing in a garden or admiring a painting. People who read them just want to enjoy the moment. 

It sounds like low stakes novels aren't for you, and that's okay. I'll agree with other comments on the *Emily Wilde* series. It's slow to start, but has higher stakes, more action, and more plot. Think Sherlock Holmes meets old Celtic Fae.",""

Yeah I mean that's kind of the point. Cozy media is for people who don't like engaging with content that has real stakes or conflict, or otherwise can't handle it. It could be someone with severe anxiety, or someone whose day to day is already very dramatic, tense, or stressful. For people who crave the sensation of boredom and simple contentedness because it may be hard to come by in their life.

It's like the literary equivalent of choosing to play Animal Crossing over Dark Souls, choosing to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of an experimental tasting menu, or rewatching an episode of a sitcom you've seen 100 times instead of a German arthouse film. The latter may be difficult to get through, but it's got more value as an overall experience. The former may not really be trying to do anything more than soothe, but it does that well.",""

If you want the fantasy version of the “cozy mystery”, you could try The Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennett, or The Witness for the Dead and sequels by Katherine Addison. 

If you like sci-fi as well, I find that Arkady Martine’s A Memory Called Empire and A Desolation Called Peace as well as Ann Leckie’s books have something of the relationship-building of cozy books while still incorporating higher stakes and more plot.

"ls4b906","mishmei","2024-10-15 23:26:32 UTC","I really, really disliked how the mob thing was handled. apparently everyone else running a business in this area just has to keep knuckling under, but Viv gets special treatment because of pastries that she didn't even make herself. ugh.","ls41hnw"
"ls493df","NeoSeth","2024-10-15 23:12:59 UTC","I'd hardly call this extensive; this is a most reasonable amount of ranting! But I am grateful for your perspective. I do not think this genre or book is for me, but a friend of mine is very interested.","ls41hnw"
"ls5ngrm","argentpepper","2024-10-16 04:59:48 UTC","I agree with most of that rant, but I don't think the magic is mind-controlly. It seems that way for a lot of the book, but the reveal at the end about how it actually works reframes it. The stone wasn't influencing them to become friends, the magic was that the stone identified a group who would naturally become good friends given the opportunity, and the magic pushed them into the same room so it could happen. So they were initially drawn to her by the magic, but the relationships they form are genuine.

Hard agree on the mob stuff though. I was sort of flabbergasted by that. The book emphasizes time and again how Viv hates bullies and mob bosses, but then she has no problem with the mob boss once they make the pastry arrangement. She really doesn't seem to care at all that there's still a violent protection racket operating in her neighborhood. I really thought there was going to be some actual conflict there, but instead the mob boss decides she loves pastries more than money and Viv forgets about her supposedly important principles in the course of like one page. An incredible deflation.

One more thing I would add is that it's wild how much the pastries solve every problem. Like at pretty much every turn, it seems like the pastries are what's keeping the shop in business, not the coffee. And Viv has nothing to do with those, it's all the pastry chef. It's like most of the story could have happened without her being there.","ls41hnw"

One of my gripes with L&L was that it repeatedly built some tension but then almost immediately introduced some miraculously convenient solution that neatly fixed everything. The crime lord and the cinnamon rolls was the most egregious offender. ","ls2rf76"

"ls5vwbl","Violet2393","2024-10-16 06:23:47 UTC","Yes! There's a lot of fantasy that's very dark and goes hard on gray morality.

She gives the cozy feels, but created through interpersonal relationships and not through lack of plot. I wouldn’t call anything about her books low stakes (quite the opposite) which seems to go against how some people are defining cozy, but I think her books feel like a big warm hug nonetheless.","ls3zuj5"
"ls6t4c7","Psittacula2","2024-10-16 12:08:52 UTC","I think your impression is spot on. I would not waste any more time with a story that mistakes cozy with saccharine if that is what it is.

Slice of Life before “cozy” and one of the best writers I have ever read: “Malgudi Days” \\~ R.K. Narayan

He has fortunately written other stories and other books set in this fictional Indian village but this particular collection of short stories in this setting are very rewarding: As much observational and descriptive masterclass of quotidian characters as it could otherwise be called “slice of life”, cozy or in Japanese “Iyashikei”.","ls444rr"

It was just a tedious and trite book all around; I can see why people call it a palate cleanser because it was mostly devoid of substance. 

I wouldn’t write off cozy books based off this one, though. Authors like Becky Chambers are doing a much better job in the genre. ","ls493df"

This guy calls one of his colleagues a lizard, gets a lecture from the captain on ""language in a multi-species environment"" and is immediately sorry. The book can't stand characters having a disagreement for longer than one or two pages.

Worse, this is how the captain describes how best to deal with this guy:

>Ashby s hackles were up but truthfully this was an ideal way for a conversation with Corbin to go Get him away from the crew let him vent wait for him to cross a line then talk him down while he was feeling penitent

I'm sorry but that's is just toxic stuff. The one guy who isn't an unhealthy people's pleaser needs to be dealt with by letting him whine in private and then use the first opportunity to invalidate his feelings and opinions for bringing in bad vibes.

Just thinking about this book again agitates me, I just hate it so much. It's all so incredibly immature - if it would at least be marketed as YA fiction, the emotional immaturity wouldn't be as surprising when reading the book.","ls449xp"
