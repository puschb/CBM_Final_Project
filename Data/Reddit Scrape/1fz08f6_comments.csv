The article points out that Biden tried to stop Netanyahu from invading Rafah (he even called it a red line) but when Netanyahu DID invade, Biden publicly went on TV to support it and said that even though tanks were rolling through the city and they were massacring Gazans it didn’t count as an invasion.

You're kind of, implying here that you have some resentment towards authority and don't like feeling people are looking down on you. But it's the same reason a doctor doesn't speak to a patient like this even in an emergency. The same reason a teacher doesn't speak to students that way. If teachers did that the classroom would turn into absolute bedlam. Politicians do it because being vulgar isn't a good bet unless you already know your audience well. Trump tries to speak in an authoritative style of language and consistently fails because he can't distinguish between excitement and disgust and has issues with boundaries. He's a sex predator and desecration excites him. 

Customer service workers use this style of language because they're just there to conduct business and they're encouraging people to behave in ways that they're in a position to take action on and to resolve as fast as possible.

“War” offers a glimpse into Harris’ private dealings with Biden as his vice president. Woodward writes that at one point she was concerned about Biden’s isolation and called one of his closest associates.

“I’m calling to ask you — to really beg you, actually — could you please talk to the president more than you talk to him?” Harris said to Biden’s friend. “Your president really loves you. You should talk to him more often than you do.”

Woodward writes: “The Biden associate was candid with the vice president. Look, one of the biggest reasons that Biden calls me, the associate said, is I provide him a level of comfort to the point where he can swear freely about ‘what a fucking asshole Joe Manchin is.’”

The vice president laughed. “That might be the only reason that he still really is comfortable with me to a point,” Harris said, according to Woodward, “because he knows that I’m the only person around who knows how to properly pronounce the word motherfucker.”","lqy4ekz"

He overruled his advisors who begged him to use more evenhanded language or acknowledge Palestinian suffering. Instead we got Biden saying he doesn’t trust Palestinians and refusing to meet any Arab-American leaders while at the same time inviting Israeli-Americans into the Oval Office for photo ops. 

The US’ unconditional support for Israel and refusal to stop any weapons shipments despite the documented war crimes has made the US *deeply* unpopular in the past year. Biden cannot get anyone to take him seriously on Iran when he does the literal same things he blames them for (he complained that Iran is giving weapons to Russia and therefore they are complicit in every civilian death in Ukraine, but seems incapable of seeing the irony). Biden wants international sanctions on Russia for invading a country and killing massive amounts of civilians, but gives Israel a complete pass. He’s undermining the international system that the US championed. 

The vast majority of the US public in both parties wants aid to Israel to be conditioned and for Biden to press both sides to a ceasefire. Biden doesn’t need to pass any new laws; he just has to follow the existing Lehy Law that says aid must be suspended if the recipient is committing war crimes. Another federal law says   Aid can’t be given to any country that blocks US humanitarian aid from being delivered and Israel is in violation of both. Biden is openly ignoring these laws and they are making him politically unpopular by doing so. It would strengthen the US’ standing among our allies in the Middle East AND Europe, as well as with multiple factions inside Israel who are angry that Netanyahu doesn’t care about the hostages and is turning down deals to return them all home.","lr0i479"

The 'observable reality' you claim isn't even the truth- I used to have to watch live streams of Biden's speeches to take notes on them all the time and would hear how normal (and typically very boring) they were, but then would go on instagram reels and see how the couple slip ups in the speech would be the only parts that go viral. If we did that same treatment to members of congress when they go to think tank panels or committee hearings that all of 5 people view, there's no comms team on the planet that could save their image. This ofc isn't to say he isn't old af, the debate clearly showed that, and i'm glad he's not running for office again, but the way they paint it is as though he's dead in a chair somewhere when in reality he's been running the government very effectively. The leaks typically are the best way to gauge white house competence, as with the Trump admin, and the leaks have been favorable of Biden for 4 years straight.

That said, I believe you are vastly overstating its significance. America isn’t weaker because Israel is smashing Iranian proxies. America isn’t any weaker because they acknowledge their ally in Israel while denouncing Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, and her supporters. These parties are, were, and always will be an enemy to the West and Europe.

The landscape irrevocably shifted when Trump backed the USA out of the nuclear deal. The outcomes since have almost completely been a consequence. If the global landscape had significantly “shifted” against America’s favor, we’re not seeing it. Yeah, Israel looks bloodthirsty, but nobody (nobody) is coming to Palestine or Hezbollah’s aid. Not even next door Arab neighbors.

Arguing that supporting Israel has made America weaker is like arguing that Ukraine blowing up the Nordstream 2 weakened her long term position. Yeah, there’s a bit of bellyache from Germany, but ultimately nothing changed for the worst. 

Outside of Arab and Russian propaganda, nobody is fooled about the elimination of jihad-minded groups lobbing rockets. And since Israel seems to be so aggressively effective at it, eliminating dozens of leaders in ways America couldn’t do in all its wars, it’s secretly a wildly popular position and good return on “investment”.","lr0lw35"

It is also a fact that more people in florida went to the polls with the intent to vote for Gore (see the butterfly ballot on Wikipedia for those who don’t know). But, under the rules, Bush won Florida but within the margin for a mandatory recount. After the mandatory recount (which turns out was just running ballots through the machines again), Gore was still behind, but within the margin where he could ask for a hand recount (see hanging chad on Wikipedia for an explanation on why this could change the outcome).  In what in hindsight was a major tactical error by his campaign, Gore requested recounts in Democratic counties. He was picking up votes and was within 500 votes of taking the lead when the Supreme Court, in a decision many legal scholars considered up there with Dred Scott on the list of bad Supreme Court decisions, stopped the counting and installed Bush. Gore conceded and his concession is one of the most patriotic acts ever. 

Turns out, had Gore asked for a full recount of all Florida ballots, he would have won Florida and the Presidency. A consortium of newspapers spent the summer after the election counting all Florida ballots by hand in order to determine the real winner of Florida. It was Gore by like 1500 had all the votes been counted. They published this news the morning of September 11, 2001. Nobody paid attention for obvious reasons. 

So yes, Al Gore was the winner of the vote but not the election. You play by the rules as they are laid down and agreed to. The world would be a different place today had he been elected.

>If you think the Middle East is your enemy then I can’t help you. 

It’s not my enemy, but when the global chess board is laid out, fundamental Islam will always be on the opposite end of the board from the West who are by and large politically secular. Every couple years the new Arab vs West conflict just reinforces this. Every Muslim American and European protests in favor of the Arab world, and the divide couldn’t be more obvious.

>Hizbullah is not popular but the sheer level of carnage that’s seen on TV that Biden can’t even pretend to condemn is ruining our image. 

We took a small bump, but the sheer efficiency by which Israel is has recently been handling its business against its enemies is also admirable, whether you agree or not. Blowing up a few thousand hezbollah pagers is wildly effective whether you want to cry foul or not. That’s a winning strategy. 

>America was broadly admired as a principled country that fought for freedom and rights and now that’s been undermined. 

Oh please, this view point was already set in stone. This belief that opinions of nations are being significantly changed without them firing a single bullet is almost preposterous.

Which ally is less of America’s ally today than they were last year? Just because Muslims and the empathetic Left have rallied together doesn’t mean that’s the entire picture. There is an equally strong anti-Arab faction, which ultimately is what the West and its allies are.

There were 3 different times where entire IT conferences were scheduled out there instead of other locations so that he could see ""that asshole IT guy"" (me).

It was weird. Everybody else would drop down and worship the ground he walked on as soon as he stepped in the door; I treated him with respect and deference, but mostly just as a normal guy a little up the food chain from me.

When we'd have conferences at headquarters, he'd send an email to the organizer and have them send me upstairs to his office. We'd go out on the patio outside, smoke a few cigarettes, have a couple of cups of coffee, and we'd shoot the shit. Random stuff about our families, current politics, leading into my perception (on the ground) of the corporate structure and culture.

I got in trouble with my division president once because of it. CEO came down to our division (one of about 25, scattered around the country), and our DP was walking the CEO around the office. Our DP called him (evidently, even in private) ""Mr. So-and-so."" They got around to my side of the building, I came out of my office and out into the hallway to greet him. I put on a big smile and charged out: ""Hey, First name Middle name, finally found your way down here, Sir?"" Pissed my DP off to no end. Wanted to find something to write me up about. I talked my way out of it by explaining that by being so close to the CEO, I was actually giving our division additional pull from an IT perspective.

This is an incorrect statement. The fascists didn’t latch on to Trump because they found being unapologetic virtuous. They latched on to the dog whistles.

??? I didnt use the word pablum in this conversation. 

I used the word in reference to the statement you made in your comment in the other conversation, which was “It’s nice to see people are people”. 

>Do you think the only reason someone shouldn’t be hypocritical is so they aren’t called out for it?

What? Do you think I’m arguing that Democrats should be hypocritical?","lqz9vag"

>Trump is barely fucking campaigning this year, has almost no ground game, and is neck and neck with Harris.

Maybe it’s time to change the strategy then. I have been criticizing the Democratic Party for their choice in presidential candidates since 2015. If Democrats struggling to run a perfect campaign can lose to or barely beat Trump three times in a row, maybe the Democratic Party’s doesn’t have a good assessment on how to run an effective campaign or otherwise effectively combat a fascist movement. 

>Nobody is suggesting Democrats be apologetic. You’re just making shit up.

Comments in reply to me are suggesting that Dems can’t be anything but “perfect” because conservative media won’t treat them fairly. This is what I mean by being apologetic. Wringing their hands over what they otherwise might say about them.","lqzfqoy"

>(lowercase) trite, naive, or simplistic ideas or writings; intellectual pap.

Could you explain how your understanding of the word differs?

“It’s nice to see people are people” fits that definition, imo.","lqz9ckd"
