"lt3fcw5","Anxious-Fun8829","2024-10-22 00:12:23 UTC","I think there's a difference between books that are organically cozy and books that are written to be cozy. 

There have always been cozy books and I agree with you that they are wanted and needed. However, it seems like after the pandemic there has been a surge in ""cozy"" books where cozy wasn't the outcome, but the intention, and it comes across a bit too twee and manufactured for me.  It's the difference between going to a real hole in the wall, local favorite restaurant with faded pictures of the owners and various patrons framed in Dollar Tree frames all over the wall vs a new chain restaurant that plasters their wall with random vintage pictures and artifacts.

And if you like cozy fiction, have you looked into the solar punk? It's a genre of scifi where nature and empathy takes over.",""

Someone is very likely to find someone who agrees with them here on why a ""popular thing actually sucks"" because quite frankly, that's the kind of people that this website tends to attract and create echo chambers for.

Cozy fantasy is fairly popular as a genre right now in the mainstream, probably boosted by fraught political events on national and international levels, as you mentioned. In addition, it has stuck around for a few years, so I don't believe its going away just because some randos on Reddit are complaining.

The mainstream trendiness of it is probably going to create more negative posts about it. I think this is especially more likely where the genre really doesn't have an official definition and standard to go by and people seem to constantly be changing and fighting over just what elements must be there to be a cozy fantasy. (Honestly, don't think Legends & Lattes would really be considered cozy SFF if it were released today with the way the definition has been changed.)

"lt5l7vn","Nodan_Turtle","2024-10-22 11:17:58 UTC","I may have had a horrid first foray into the genre, but The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet didn't become my most disliked book simply because there were no stakes.

The stakes, such as they were, came off as *fake*.  Any problem was only there to make a character accept a different character.  Pirates board the spaceship to rob them? Just kidding it's a way to have a character say they're fine with.... someone having a loving family.

It also felt like a betrayal in a way, because the supposed premise sounded actually interesting - a woman hides her identity to board a spaceship of misfits, so they don't find out she's related to a weapons manufacturing company owner right as war might break out.

And that... went nowhere.  It only existed so someone could accept them and... that's it?

The book didn't make me feel cozy, it made me enraged lol.  Like the author personally spat in my eye by not bothering to have a story, just random fanfic style scenes stapled together and largely unrelated.

If I want to take a break from high-stakes, action heavy books, there's plenty out there already without having to eschew a real story along the way.  Comedy, romance, hell I've read science fiction and fantasy that also were much more casual affairs.

So to me the genre comes off as pointless as Chamber's debut novel, though I admit that book may have truly poisoned my ability to ever want to read anything similar again.",""

ETA: Reading through this again I find this post extremely odd. Maybe some people don’t Ike the modern “twee” stylings of books like Legends and Lattes or Chambers’ stuff (I don’t) but low conflict, slice of life story telling is hardly in need of a defense.

It's just such a weird take that people have somehow convinced themselves that cozy media cannot exist in the same space as traditional dramatic media. It's not a new take and it probably won't ever go away.

My frustration is that you feel so confident prescribing _coziness and calmness_ and saying definitively that it _is better to take a step back and enjoy the small things in life_ and that _there’s no need for the entirety of our fiction to be the same._ 




Who are you speaking for? Yourself? Others who like this genre? You (and people who push the idea of a universal importance of this genre) leave no nuance for the possibility that others people are getting something deeply meaningful from our books about war and violence, (which I would not associate with apathy), that cannot be found in cosy fiction.

"lt6csa3","ObstinateHdstrngGrl","2024-10-22 14:21:36 UTC","My husband sent this to me and I came to have an opinion.

I have read and/or watched the examples given here and I agree so deeply that I want more of this type of writing.

But I do have a slightly different perspective.

I think it’s really important to acknowledge that war and violence and apathy are still very present in many of these stories. Often the protagonist is seeking refuge from exactly these things. Or, more often, the real life struggles that bring the same amount of devastation like terminal illness or loss of loved ones or being stuck in a situation that keeps you maligned with your values. 

What makes these narratives different is that they are not from the perspective of the people perpetrating the violence, starting or ending the war, or at the beginning of apathy. These are the stories of the masses. 

Even Legends and Lattes (which I think is the weakest example of this) tells a story of finding the right people with the right skills to do the right work to create a different kind of life.

I believe they are more relevant than the stories more directly about conflict because they are better mirrors for what it actually looks like to do the hard right work. What does it actually look like to build a slower, more socially conscious community? How do we take the first steps into a different way of being? How do we disengage from the narratives of power-over power and live into the more aspirational power structures of power-with and power-to?

I love these stories because they give us a different way forward. They show us what it looks like to champion sunshine, peacefulness, and empathy as more valuable than violence and war and apathy. When the characters in these stories come across those more traditional themes their response is grief. They know the cost. And they are willing to do work to build a better way.

Engaging in these stories gives us tools to better show up and work towards the world we say we want. Teaching us how to be thoughtful of perspectives we may not have, holding us accountable to our selves and our communities. What does it actually look like? It looks a lot like your regular life. Boring, consistent, and quietly magical. 

These stories show us how to pay attention to the little opportunities we have to change ourselves. That is how we change the world. Not the big loud catastrophic events. But with the quiet little moments. One at a time.",""

But as an older defense of the very different sword and sorcery genre went, “Nobody hates escape except jailers”. You don’t need to be engaging with the darker aspects of life all the time.

Furthermore, even under bad times life has positive aspects, and there’s nothing wrong with describing these as well. Life isn’t all dark.

Other genres have escapist aspects as well. Romance has frequently unrealistic love stories. Mysteries often focus narrowly on one crime that can be solved. Space opera focuses on a technological spacefaring future we may never see. Even literary fiction is usually slanted to please the prejudices of publishers and literati. It’s not clear to me cozy fiction is that much worse in this regard.

Finally, this isn’t the best time in the world, but it’s not clear to me living in, say, the Depression and WW2, the Mongol Conquests, or the Black Plague didn’t have many of the same aspects. And if you weren’t fleeing the Wehrmacht or the horsemen…well, life went on.",""

We seem to see books as a thing that needs to be ‘sophisticated’ or otherwise you’re just lazy or dumb, that you want to be able to read without putting in the effort or time. Reading is literally a hobby for the majority of the population, yet we seem to think it’s something we need to put so much energy into.

I think a lot of people agree with you in needing that gentle, cosy fix to escape the pressures of life and sooth yourself. For me, it's all about finding the good authors of this genre though. It has to draw me in, with interesting ideas and characters, philosophical themes or just simply great writing. I'm more willing to let bad writing slide with a plot-driven novel like the psychological thrillers I gorged myself on, until I got sick of them, or even Jilly Cooper style trash.

But a lot of imitators don't seem as able to pull it off as well as her and the result can come off as quite flat. 


I'd also question whether ""cozy"" as a genre/aesthetic/vibe even needs to be defended against people who think it's boring and pointless. A lot of people think some of the stuff I enjoy is boring/pointless but unless they're calling me a bad person for engaging with it (e.g. ""horror fans are disturbed"") or trying to stop it existing, I don't have a problem.

Also ironically some people find stardew very stressful - and it does have some darker themes.

There will be some level of violence and often death, but between expecting it going in and knowing that the detective will solve the mystery and bring the perpetrator to justice it doesn't have the sting it might in a different genre.

"lt4cyck","NoFluffyOnlyZuul","2024-10-22 03:47:12 UTC","This is so condescending and pretentious. Your definition of ""escapism"" is not everyone else's. For many people, escaping into wild science fiction, fantasy, and historical worlds is thrilling and a wonderful way to unwind. Reading a story with no stakes does not magically equate to quality relaxation. For me, a good book that is well written, has interesting characters, and fully engages me is relaxing and an incredible escape from the world. If the plot includes desperate struggles, battles between good and evil, a descent into madness, or otherwise, it doesn't somehow make it less relaxing or less of an escape.

I can guarantee this superior attitude is why people roll their eyes, not the existence of ""cozy fiction"" itself. Discworld, for instance, is peak cozy fantasy and it's a beloved classic series that countless readers treasure.

There’s also the book *Ecotopia* by Ernest Callenbach, a bit older and dated in some ways, but still holds – it can also be found for free online.

Many of Ursula K. LeGuin’s books are also in that category, like the *Dispossessed* and *Always Coming Home.*

Also, Kim Stanley Robinson’s books, especially the *Mars Trilogy* would be in that category.

There are also several short story collections like *Solarpunk Summers, Solarpunk Winters, Wings of Renewal* and others. I’d also direct you to the r/Solarpunk subreddit, which has a very nice list of Solarpunk media, books included.","lt3hkpu"

My criticism of cosy fiction's mainly just that it feels like an overly synthetic, marketised approach to the craft of writing in the first place.

And if we all went along with this idea of “there are people who have it worse than you,” then logic suggests there is only one person on this whole planet who is entitled to feel rubbish about their situation. There is only one person who doesn’t have anyone else stealing the “worse off” crown from them, so this entire ""argument"" is invalid.
There is no hierarchy to feeling depressed, no hierarchy to trauma, no hierarchy to feeling fed up with things or to going through a bad patch in life. There is no ranking for everyone’s individual situations and circumstances, or for which are “better” or “worse.” Why do people feel the need to tell someone whether they’re entitled to feel a certain way, or to compare their own or another person’s situation to it?
