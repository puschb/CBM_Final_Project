"lrjgut8","pink_ghost_cat","2024-10-12 08:59:40 UTC","I suggest that it might be related to a person‚Äôs imagination. Some people have very vivid imagination and almost see the things that books describe, and their brain adds a few extra horrors free of charge, lol. The films may not have the right ‚Äúscary‚Äù elements which work for me, so I‚Äôd consider some books terrifying. 
Now, there are other people who are not as imaginative or can more easily separate written text from reality or simply not have scary images in their mind at the time of reading. So, when they actually see something in films (given it‚Äôs a good film with good actors and great music to accompany) they are more immersed and don‚Äôt waste their mental energy on understanding the text in from of them, they  are fully available to be scared full-time :D

The movie can be terrifying, for sure, but it doesn't generate the same depth of feeling that the book does. The book does a much better job of humanizing Paul and making him a more empathetic character even when he's at his worst. It also better conveys the stress and terror that he's in throughout than the movie did and makes Annie much more horrifying as a person, especially at the end. I don't think it emphasized the difference of their characters and Annie's past enough to really drive home what she'd done, was planning to do, and the reasons why.

A book plays out in your brain and lives in there. A movie plays out on a screen. You can turn it off and it goes away. There's a lot to take your out of being fully immersed in a movie -- bad acting, bad cinematography, ""oh hey isn't that Brad Pitt?"" etc.


I admit I watch some movies that might be particular scary to me on the small screen at home where it feels domesticated to its little box and I can pause it when it overwhelms.


But movies just don't terrify me the way books can. The first Jurassic Park, in the theater, was immersive and powerful and I got jump-scared and screamed. It just doesn't live forever in my brain with the same horror of some distressing books. I'll rewatch Jurassic Park for fun.¬† ""The Birds"" scared the crap out of me but I LOVE watching it again. Whereas there are a number of books I thought were excellent but will never reread because I can't go through the psychological harrowing again.


Schindler's List is the only movie like that for me. I'm glad I saw it but I feel exactly zero need to relive that trauma. My kids are getting to the age they'll watch it in school and I GUESS if they ask I'll watch with them to be a safe space for them, but I dread it.",""

The Shining and The Stand by Stephen King

The Shining is the rare book that I loved but cannot read again anytime soon because it was profoundly disturbing about how a person can lose their mind in isolation which is entirely plausible. The movie gives me the creeps. The Stand, considering recent events, is a little too close to home.

I cant imagine reading fiction that is more fucked up. And in regards to your debate with your friend, you couldn't make a movie as graphic as the book, not as graphic as your imagination. If you made it as graphic it would not be allowed to shown. spoiler alert : Also in the movie its made more palatable by making the disturbing events a figment of the Batemen's mind, this is not the case in the book, he is really doing all the fucked up things he's doing and that makes it much more disturbing in the end. 

Another example that comes to mind is The Beach. Again the movie is a very tame version of the book. Spoiler alert skip this paragraph if you havent read the book: the ending of the book is very fucked up because Richard spkies everyone with mushrooms and while they are tripping out of their mind the group collectively witness traumatic events and then gang stab Richard. You could shoot this version of the movie but it would be very difficult to translate the psychological trauma that is inflicted on the characters.

Now that‚Äôs one example and I‚Äôm one individual but I can understand what your friend is saying. I‚Äôve read scary books that have scared me, but I would have to agree that the emotion of fear is more closely linked visual and audio input than conceptual thought.

For a different example of something a book can do that a movie struggles with, consider Lolita. I‚Äôve seen so many discussions of why the various movie versions fail.

Well, I read it for a horror literature class I took in college, and of the 20ish people in that class I was the only one who managed to read it all the way through, and we'd already got through a good deal of Lovecraft, Poe, M. R. James, and Algernon Blackwood material that nobody had that kind of problem with.

That story isn't frightening in the way a horror movie is, I'll grant you, but there are much, much more frightening ideas than being killed in the shower by a madman that literature can convey where movies can't.",""

I am glad the book was not \\*too\\* graphic but the unfortunate life of Sally Horner (never heard about her story before) broke my heart. Not only she spent part of her childhood with an abuser, her mind totally screwed up and brainwashed for part of the time but when she came back home...well...

The attitude of the society was and still is absolutely awful to victims, where she was treated as someone dirty. And she did not end up living at least a bit happy life....

What I find also terrible is that Nabokov apparently took an ""insipration"" here while Sally definitely did not do any of it willingly and Frank Salle was a psycho and a sick man. Not sure what inspiration you may take from this....

And then...not the entire book but a part of IT by Stephen King. That gangbang scene there is absolutely insane, not necessary and I have no idea how he could come up with something like that with 12-13 years old kids. Being basically raped by your best friends at that age would mess up anybody. I am glad it was ignored in the latest adaptation. King is a great writer and his characters are often very rich and interesting but this one proves that every horror writer has some very twisted ideas.....",""

I will agree with your friend on the soundtrack aspect. Music can do a ***lot*** to heighten your mood and put you on the edge of your seat. The rest of what he says *might* be true for him. Some people can‚Äôt visualize as well as others. Also, for some people the effort needed to read the book can insulate them from the suspense/eeriness/terror. For instance, I would never get the same feeling out of a book written in the style/level that *Crime and Punishment* is that I do either of the two books above because I have to work at getting the visuals due to the writing complexity which removes me a bit from the immersion and immediacy you need for the true terror. 

Additionally, you don‚Äôt generally get the jump scare in books. It can happen but it‚Äôs rare and a different quality (again we come back to the soundtrack).

"lrn8rvv","JinxiBoo222","2024-10-13 00:00:18 UTC","I agree with you that books can be just as scary, but recently I realized something about different media in the horror genre. There‚Äôs so many sub categories to it and each type of media can portray a different perspective and experience to the story or piece. A lot of movies are shown from a perspective from a third party, where you are along for the ride but not in any danger or feel part of the story, it‚Äôs what makes a lot of scary movies fun. Then there‚Äôs ones that immerse you in the atmosphere and make it more like what‚Äôs on the screen could still be there after or could happen to you, these are more book-like, in that you‚Äôre experiencing more and feel more involved. Movies like this seem to have hit or miss reviews or end up as cult classics later. It could be that that guy prefers a more fun approach to scary rather than a full chill to the bone type of scary. For example, my boyfriend or I will pick out a movie and say ‚Äòit‚Äôs a scary movie‚Äô and then the other will ask ‚Äòwhat kind?‚Äô And for example I showed him Trick‚Äôr‚ÄôTreat the other week and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs a fun, almost feel good comfort scary- the Halloween version of a spirit of Christmas movie‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs Halloween so it‚Äôs scary.‚Äù Or he described to me Event Horizon as ‚Äúit‚Äôs actually scary and it‚Äôs in space.‚Äù So I knew to be prepared for cosmic horror. Similar to books, there‚Äôs different types and different ways the author portrays the story to either be lighter like watching a play or deeper and all encompassing like you‚Äôre living the words on the page. Like video games too, it‚Äôs all about how you prefer your media to be presented and then what type of scares you want.",""

I will say that what an individual finds scary depends hugely on personal preference and experiences‚Äîbasically it‚Äôs a psychological thing. I connect better with written words than film, which I think is because characters are the main part of anything I get out of a book, and reading provides a deeper insight into their minds whereas watching them onscreen is usually more ambiguous.

Besides that, I‚Äôm not ‚Äúscared‚Äù by violence/gore as much as annoyed or unpleasantly disturbed. And horror for me is essentially a mini adrenaline kick but at a comfortable distance‚Äîhence I prefer a puzzle to be solved or just something eerie, while, say, people being chased by a killer feels too close to reality to be enjoyable.

Like for me, music/lighting in movies plays a big part in getting me freaked out, so I'm scared even before the actual scary thing happens. And I fall for every jump scare, which you can't really do in books.

That being said, movies also have a big limit in the sense of MPAA ratings, which books don't have. Even R-rated movies have a lot of restrictions for what they can and can't do (I know NC-17 doesn't have those restrictions, but most studios try to avoid NC-17 ratings because they're a box office death sentence). So books can get really into disturbing gore that most movies can't--I watched American Psycho no problem, but there are scenes from the book that still make me squirm just thinking about them. 

Books also have more time to flesh out ideas and get more intimate in characters' minds, so that can also heavily add to the unsettling factor. But overall, I think it really just depends on what you personally find creepy/unsettling/scary.

For example, ""The Peregrine"" by J. A. Baker is the most disturbing book I have ever read. It completely changed my view of humanity, nature and our relationship with each other. But I don't think you could ever communicate that in a film.

Another example I read recently is ""Tower of Basel"". If this was presented as a film, I would have dismissed it as a bunch of crazy conspiracy theories. But in book form it's very convincing, and rather chilling.

On the film side, there are documentaries like ""The Russian Woodpecker"". It's disturbing, but at the same time you feel like you're being manipulated. Since you don't really have the option to go and check the references yourself, the filmmakers have no motivation to be honest about what they are telling you, and so the overall effect is less convincing.

In contrast devourers savour each word, they take longer but are way more susceptible to well written horror

And not all horror scenes in horror are written well, because writing horror is an add on skill after writing, just as writing crime is different and tbh some horror writers writing horrific scenes but not horror

So a skimmer gets the scene and go wow that's gross and move on and devourers go wow that's gross but it's not written in the way good horror is (long sprawling descriptions focussing on senses, then quick short sentences, often with no corollary description for action)

So a devourer is more likely to be horrified by a horror description of something banal, where skimmers are rarely bothered at all",""

While reading it's like I'm in a movie in a VR set. If I'm interested in the book I dont recall the words or that I'm reading, it's a movie playing out around me (and I also lose track of time, etc).

Hence a book being more scary than a movie. My brain is pretty good at imagining the worst kind of stuff that will scare me. Meanwhile a lot of ""monsters"" in movies are laughable in comparison.

There's actually an artist that sketched a couple of 'monsters' they ""saw"" when they had night terrors and those were the closest things I remember seeing that came close to what I ""see"" in my head and the ominous feelings they trigger when I'm reading horror.

I tried to imagine Ronald McDonald skateboarding, but infront of me- a mini version skating along the sofa, leaping on and off cushions. I realised that focusing on the physics of the skateboard meant R. McDonald was very vague (like blurry but almost invisible). 

Do you ever get earworms? Would you need to hum the tune?

I asked my wife, who confirmed that‚Äôs how reading is for her. She ends up reading more fiction and I end up reading more poetry, largely because of the way poetry connects different ideas and experiences.

It doesn't really get clearer, no. Whatever detail I am reading currently is the most clear, and whatever I've read ""goes away"". To, give an example:

>‚ÄúIn the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains.‚Äù

When I read this bit by Hemingway, I first have a flash of ""summer"" - green leaves, sunshine, grass. Then it is gone, and I have this sense of a house, but then that is replaced by a tiny village, and then that is gone it is a river, and so on. I don't maintain the individual features once I've read them, and I don't link them together to make the full image of the house in the village by the river.
