"lpzvj63","Zapchic","2024-10-02 16:15:42 UTC","I think it's funny you mentioned Updike today. I was thinking of my experience with the Rabbit series after seeing a post here asking for book recommendations for characters that make you want to hate them. 

Almost 2 decades ago I picked up Rabbit Run from the library and loved everything about it. I love the writing style and time period. I understand that Harry was a misogynistic ass but something about the story flowed for me. Years later a friend gifted me the book series and I again read Rabbit Run... Same experience. I moved onto Rabbit Redux and thought okay, there's another book, Harry will somehow redeem himself and make it worth it. Again I like the writing style. So I started reading Rabbit is Rich and got about halfway through it before I closed the book and never opened it again. I think I donated it there promptly after. 

I have never been so pissed off at a character in my life. I don't even remember what Harry did to break the camels back, I just remember being so angry and disgusted with the person and realizing that they had zero redeemable qualities. 

In some ways I think Updike won me over. He got me emotionally and wrapped me up in my thoughts. He made me think. I might still read another book of his at some point but if you go in thinking you'll finally love this character, you are sorely mistaken. 😂",""
"lpzmvns","Lightup-gold","2024-10-02 15:30:25 UTC","I’ll take a swing at defending the Rabbit novels since everyone here (at the time I am writing this comment) is on the other side.

First, there is nothing to defend about the misogyny, either embedded in the novels or in Updike’s worldview. And Rabbit is frequently, casually despicable. But with regards to OP’s assessment - “this pervasive belief that his characters seem to have that women are … so ‘exotic and unknowable,’” don’t we all still know men who really are like this? Maybe less so now given political polarization and the Big Sort. But they’re there. Polling for this coming election has demonstrated a broadening political divide between men and women. The debate about the relationship between men and women is playing out in our politics in a way that makes it seem as though we have not progressed at all. I mean, all the stuff JD Vance has said recently, for example. The tradwife trends. Abortion rights.  

I digress. For the same reason that I loved Mad Men despite the tremendous failings of its protagonist, I loved the Rabbit novels because 1. they feel like little time capsules and 2. they demonstrate the emptiness of the American dream in often subtle and interesting ways. I enjoy maximalist prose, which is not for everyone, and really the third person perspective is so close to Rabbit that if you loathe him, there is no escaping the feeling. I don’t place as much value on authorial intention as some people do, so your mileage may vary.

Updike is also very good at writing the , uh, profundity of mundane experience. Which probably isn’t in vogue now, but it’s something I’ve always enjoyed in his writing.",""
"lq09ack","Square_Stuff3553","2024-10-02 17:28:06 UTC","Also on the Rabbit books, I think Updike disliked Rabbit more than anyone here—and that’s what makes the books so great.

Your description of 
> suburban, milquetoast misogyny

"lpzqg7i","Alternative_River_86","2024-10-02 15:49:37 UTC","Your reaction is certainly justified and honestly I think it's the right way for anyone to come away from Updike, but I have to offer a word of ""defense.""

I would look less at the author for blame and more at the characters and story for explanation. Updike is writing about the spiritual crisis of mid-20th century America and is attempting to convey reality. His narrators are not supposed to be saints, far from it. It's a patriarchal, misogynistic place, and it's a world seen through the eyes of a man that doesn't understand women. If the narrator in his book (any of them) was a progressive man who understood women, it would be an entirely different story and an entirely different world. And that type of man would not have embodied the essence of the era or been a successful vehicle for Updike's themes.

I was also grossed out the first time I read The Centaur, later when I got to the Rabbit series I hated the way Rabbit talked about Janice. But as I've gotten older I've tried to ignore that because Updike is not alone among titans of literature that produced work that disgusts and offends. Touch on the Southern Gothics, Flannery O'Connor, Faulkner, Morrison, Dickey...truth is ugly, truth follows no set ethical and political lines, it is simply truth. To understand the psyche and soul of America at Updike's time, of consumerism, and the enormously fraught notion of ""family values,"" white picket fence dreams, spiritual ennui, the emptiness of middle class aspiration at the heart of of the type of lives that people led and the type of people this lifestyle produced, it's not going to be pretty or straight or even. Great literature shouldn't be, I would argue. I think Updike himself would want his readers to come away nauseous.

Of course if you don't see the redeeming value in his artistry and the meaning beneath the misogyny of the characters, that does not mean you're wrong, or that you should unduly force yourself to like Updike's work. Different literature speaks to different people, at different times in their life. Maybe try him again in a decade. Or maybe read something with beautifully done female characters like Margaret Atwood or Emily St. John Mandel to cleanse your palate.",""

I think what I find so compelling about those stories is how Updike portrays people who are knowingly unlikeable, and yet still compelling enough to get through an entire book. Your mileage may vary on this, of course.

I haven't read The Village, but the Rabbit books in particular seem to portray a cast of characters so obviously terrible, every last one of them, that it reads more like misanthropy to me than just straight misogyny. Though there's plenty of that as well!

Ultimately, I think what he describes in his novels is a realistic portrait of an ugly segment of the United States. I find that valuable, if uncomfortable, and his prose is often beautiful. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to ask the boys of Reddit why they love John Fowles so much.",""

One can argue how intentionally Updike inhabits his character's voice. I don't know, and I just don't read that way. To me it was fitting with the character. I never saw Rabbit as intended to be liked or disliked. He is a man, a lot of men share similarities, with his character, and through that lens it's a wonderful character study.

I'm not a literary critic, but I believe Updike is among the most gifted 'sentence by sentence' writers ever to live, and that heavily influences my opinion. He was imo a great writer, but that doesn't mean his characters weren't mysogynistic. Maybe he was too? I don't know. I just read the words, not research his life.

It was just mildly-sleazy, negative-spirited tedium. It wasn't grand in its ambitions or impressive in its style; it was almost like biographical reportage of someone whose life isn't interesting. If that's what floats anyone's boat, then fair play to them, but it's not a novel that I felt I benefited from having read.

The women in that story are, generally, treated badly by the main character. He's not a nice person to women - or anyone else really, but especially women - and is largely self-pitying and egocentric. If you need to have well-rounded or strong women in your books to enjoy them, then I would give it a miss.

I think the topic of authors not writing women well is generally pretty overplayed. I don't think authors have any obligation to write women in any greater depth of detail than they feel is needed to support the story that they wish to tell. However, if as a matter of preference, you find it hard to enjoy books that don't treat women well, either in the story or as fleshed-out characters, then Updike's probably not the place to go.",""

I wanted to give him a chance. A number of people here have mentioned the misogyny--and it's plentifully there in this book. But I think that's the point, and I didn't see Rabbit as specifically a misogynist as much as generally he's a narcissist, through and through; one with some self-awareness but not enough to keep him from indulging himself in very poor behavior. 

So *liking* him or not isn't really the point, for me. Of course I disliked him. He's a selfish shit who hurts others. As a literary character, though, I tried to see him as a particular character of his time and place--a misogynistic man in a culture full of them; privileged, white male East-Coast--and profoundly confused and fucked up. Updike wrote about people he knew. Having lived in that culture and area for a while, I knew some people kind of like this as well, though of a different era than Rabbit, Run. So it was an uncomfortable read, as it should have been. 

It's stuck with me, the book and the character. I didn't like the character, but the book left an impression and gave me the sense that, for better or worse, Updike captured a character and a time, and a place.

"lpzn9zq","TomLondra","2024-10-02 15:32:36 UTC","(Man here) Yes, there's very noticeable gender discrimination in fiction writing. I suppose it's inevitable that if an author is honest, they will write out of their own experience; so a woman will write about the world as seen by a woman, and a man will do likewise.

As a male reader, I'm always aware of ""misogyny"". But I'm a big admirer of Updike, mainly because he subverts the idea of suburban life, and reveals marriage for the total mess it so often is. ""Rabbit Run"" is a masterpiece - a not very likable man trying to run away from his marriage.

In these stories, women are described as the man perceives them. I wouldn't say this is out and out misogyny- we know all too well where to find that - it's more like the blinkered view that men have of women and women have of men. And to a man, women are indeed another planet.

Another example is my favourite writer of all, in the ""dirty American realism"" genre - Richard Ford. The main character Frank Bascombe, in many of his novels, is cynical about women yet fascinated by them.  Like Updike, he writes beautiful prose about messed-up people.

For a real example of unexamined misogyny in American fiction, I give you Cormac McCarthy. In my review of ""The Road"" (on Goodreads) I wrote *McCarthy has banished women from his narrative; the few who do appear - fleetingly - have been relegated to the status of child-bearing minor characters. There was once a woman in the life of the man, but she died when the boy was born and now she only appears (twice) in the man's dreams, without features except for a pair of erect nipples under a diaphonous dress. Curious. Again the underlying psychology is interesting to think about here. McCarthy's world is a place for men - men like him - and the devastation was brought about by men. I don't know how his women readers may feel about this. With amusement, I suspect.*

I don't read women's fiction (much) because I can't get into the author's viewpoint. There are exceptions: being Irish I do read Irish female writers (except Sally Rooney, who is awful): Sara Baume, Claire Keegan, Mary Costello, Anna Burns....",""

>Lister, Rachel (2005) *Open destinies : modern American women and the short story cycle*. Doctoral thesis, Durham University.  https://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1280/. *Open access*

Lister quotes Joyce Carol Oates describing men in precisely this way:

>""And her eyes transformed weirdly by a power she would never dare take on, herself - what beauty might they have, not known to her ... \\[her husband\\] too was transformed, something **quite exotic and unknowable**, but there was no way of seeing him, no way in"".  (Lister p140)

>The late and now-sainted David Foster Wallace was more brutally Oedipal.

>In a notorious and opinion-shaping 1997 review of Updike's *Toward the End of Time*, Wallace railed against the elderly writer as a ""phallocrat,"" a ""narcissist,"" a ""solipsist"" and quoted the devastating judgment of a friend who memorably summed up Updike as ""a penis with a thesaurus.""

>As with Baker, paternal sexuality is the key to Wallace's response. Updike was the bard of suburban adultery, the definitive chronicler of bed-hopping among the barbeque set. Wallace looked at Updike with the disenchanted eyes of a son pondering his old man's feckless skirt-chasing.

>""The children of the same impassioned infidelities and divorces Mr. Updike wrote about so beautifully,"" Wallace complained, ""got to watch all this brave new individualism and self-expression and sexual freedom deteriorate into the joyless and anomic self-indulgence of the Me Generation.""

*Add*:  Here is the 1997 [Wallace review](https://observer.com/1997/10/john-updike-champion-literary-phallocrat-drops-one-is-this-finally-the-end-for-magnificent-narcissists/).  It is not a takedown.

Rather, it is a rant that begins with a childish turd joke -- ***John Updike, Champion Literary Phallocrat, Drops One*** -- before getting down to business:   ""*Mailer, Updike, Roth: The Great Male Narcissists who’ve dominated postwar realist fiction are now in their senescence ... ""* (*Frederick Exley* and *Charles Bukowski* are soon added to the list, and elsewhere [A.O. Scott](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/weekinreview/21scott.html) quotes him:  ""*If I have an enemy,” he said in the early 1990s, “a patriarch for my patricide, it’s probably Barth and Coover and Burroughs, even Nabokov and Pynchon.”*).

Wallace's compulsive listing of, and sexually couched attacks, on older men seems ... creepy.

I'll mention in passing that Mailer was indeed old, and only wrote one more novel.  Roth, however, still had some of his best-known work ahead of him -- nine novels, notably *The Human Stain*, *The Plot Against America*, and *Everyman*.

To his credit, Wallace -- then 35 -- also provides a surprisingly insightful self-analysis in his review.   After reading some details of Wallace's own life and relationships in Yale Prof. Amy Hungerford's *On Not Reading DFW* (in *Making Literature Now,* 2016, Stanford U Press) his comment on his own generation *hits hard*, as the kids say:

>*Today’s sub-40s have different horrors, prominent among which are anomie and solipsism and a peculiarly American loneliness: the prospect of dying without once having loved something more than yourself.*","lq01pdc"

But OP’s question was “why does he write about them [women] like they are another species?” 

My only point is that Updike is, with sexist characters like Rabbit, representing a point of view that is (still) not uncommon. If you’re thinking, “Why do I want to read the perspective of a sexist man,” you’re not alone and I don’t blame you at all. But to the extent that literature allows you to get inside and understand other perspectives, I think it’s worth acknowledging that that perspective is on offer here.

The degree to which Updike himself was a sexist, and embodied the views put forth in his writing, is definitely something worth discussing, but personally doesn’t impact how I view his works that much. I still take what I like and discard what I don’t, still read sexist characters as sexist, etc.

Now, I don’t think anything I’ve said indicates that it’s “ok” to be sexist.

John Updike writes books and stories about deeply shallow men.  Putting their flaws in a showcase is not the same thing as putting them on a pedestal; quite the contrary, in my view.  

I think this is his point:  the real-life women his men encounter -- and more importantly, their understanding of them -- are nothing at all like their mothers and sisters. Nor would *any* fiction be believable if they were.

His 1999 book *Brief Interviews with Hideous Men* is instructive in regard to Wallace's attitude toward women.  There is some debate over whether or not he was being *ironic*, or was engaging in some of the [New Sincerity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_sincerity) he is associated with, and ""*break\\[ing\\] away from concepts of postmodernist irony and cynicism*.""

I highly recommend Yale Prof. Amy Hungerford's chapter *On Not Reading DFW* in her 2016 book *Making Literature Now* (Stanford U Press), quoted briefly here and below.  It is her discussion, rather than her personal decision to boycott him, that is of interest.

>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief\\_Interviews\\_with\\_Hideous\\_Men#Themes\\_and\\_analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_Interviews_with_Hideous_Men#Themes_and_analysis)

>In light of revelations regarding Wallace's abusive behavior toward [Mary Karr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Karr), some scholars have questioned the motives of Wallace's stories, particularly in the collection which prominently featured misogynistic male characters. Amy Hungerford, a professor of English at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University), most notably in her book *Making Literature Now*, posed the same question for the collection and whether we can separate the art from the artist. She concluded in the negative and argued that readers and academics should stop reading and teaching Wallace's work. 

These two papers exemplify the mental gymnastics required to find the irony (and excuse the misogyny) in these Wallace stories. A quote from the second furthers Hungerford's comment.

>In her book chapter, “On Not Reading DFW,” literary scholar Amy Hungerford poses the lurking question: can we separate art from the artist? She questions Wallace’s motives, arguing that readers and teachers alike must ask themselves “whether the stories \\[within Brief Interviews\\] revel in or revile the hideousness of their men” (Hungerford 149). She concludes that we cannot separate Wallace’s work, particularly Brief Interviews, from his personal life.

Also, in those times, who was going to “call him out?” The other members of the patriarchy? The women who couldn’t even get a bank account or credit card without a man’s approval? The people of color who were still segregated (actually in the first novel, and societally for the next 3.5)?

I was surprised that Lister's quote from Oates was the only google hit for this phrase and Updike, so read some of her [(interesting) thesis](https://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1280/).   I then confirmed I had not misunderstood OP by searching *Villages* for both words.

Lister provides an extensive discussion of *both* Updike's and Oates's views of men, women, and marriage, and the difficulty they faced as authors.  Her particular focus is on the *short story cycle*; using separate stories to paint a single, complete picture, pointing out that ""*As a form that builds itself upon the principle of repetition, the story cycle has established itself as a useful medium for the representation of marital ritual.""* (p123)

From Lister's Chapter 3, *Insularity and Integration: Joyce Carol Oates's Sequential Cycles*, which ""*considers how Joyce Carol Oates uses the sequential cycle to represent gender identity as a social construct*"":

>*Neither Oates nor Updike champion insularity; they both point towards a commonality between the genders and the permeability of gender boundaries.  However, Oates's fictional world usually reveals such possibilities to the reader only. ... Most of her characters are destined to remain in the dark.*  (p124)

>*Once the marriages have dissolved, there is no other narrative for these wives.  Oates offers a bleaker vision of separation than John Updike.* (p129)

If I were seeking to ascribe a lack of empathy for female characters to an author, Updike would not necessarily be my first target.

But in fact, I find no lack of empathy in either author.  Rather, both in their own ways are struggling to evoke in the reader some understanding of the startling lack of insight that men and women have in themselves and each other (which is displayed endlessly on Reddit's many advice-request subreddits).

I might compare this problem to the common criticism of David Mamet's dialog -- that it is repetitive and unnatural -- and its common defense:  Mamet is not aiming for realism, but rather is trying to reveal the character's inner voice as he speaks.

You don't have to like it or understand or even read it, but Updike is revealing something about people that exists.  Something that isn't puppy dogs and roses or even fair.  Something that's flawed and often gross.  That's worth exploring, too.  That's why you read Updike.","lpzvceu"
