I host a book club where we exclusively read books in the mystery, thriller, horror, and suspense genres. Some of the content is very dark. This book sounds like it’d be right up our alley! Also, the dynamics of the book club matter. We had someone who regularly attends and is an integral part of the club once suggest a book that everyone thought was terrible (myself included) and we still had the best time ripping it apart. Don’t beat yourself up too much - sometimes it’s not you, it’s them.😉",""

"lqd5dpv","deadregime","2024-10-04 21:26:33 UTC","I recommend Geek Love by Katherine Dunn. It's about a couple who try to spice up a failing traveling circus by devising ways to give birth to their own circus freaks to create a thriving sideshow. The couple's children have a variety of defects, Siamese twins, etc... It flips back and forth between past and present, involves Machiavellian plots by one of the children, and is just generally a weirdly delightful (IMO) story that also happens to be very well written. Absolutely nobody liked it, it definitely changed the way several members looked at and treated me, and caused one person to quit the club. Nobody ever voted for anything I nominated ever again and I eventually left because they never strayed too far from chick lit and Oprah books and I got tired of it.",""

I keep up with a small group of university friends and we always correspond at Christmas about books. I was a hundred or so pages into _A Little Life_ and was so thrilled by it – the group in their twenties at law school reminded me so much of us as younger men, and how we’d begun to each plot our varying paths through life.

So that Christmas, instead of the usual regular correspondence, I bought everyone else a copy – I suppose so we could informally book-club it together. And in fairness they did seem to like that first part … only what I didn’t know was it would immediately nosedive into five hundred more pages of unremitting grimness and abuse, trauma porn, unpleasant character arcs, high camp melodrama, the works. I don’t think it was even clear from act one that everyone was going to turn out gay.

Fortunately my friends are kind enough never to have returned to the subject, but I sometimes cringe wondering what they thought I was up to, recommending that? Like what message was I trying to convey?",""

A couple of years later a book group I'd joined was looking for a horror so I suggested this. 

It's actually so bad, and very racist. There's not a redeeming feature to it. I'd read The Terror since so I know Dan Simmons is a good writer, he has empathy, he's not racist in the slightest, but Song of Kali was just not good. We were all just not impressed at all.",""

Their group chat was super active for the whole six weeks with guys reacting to it. He had so much fun and got so much out of the discussion, having never been much of a literary analysis guy.

This involved researching the poet, their works, and gathering up some materials for the other members to read before the meeting. I decided to present on Sharon Olds because we had all casually read one of her lighter, more humorous poems during a poetry workshop we all took together. Anyway, I got a few of her books and read through them as prep, and one of them was very dark! I believe it was called ""Poems for the Living and the Dead"" and the section on the ""dead"" had a subsection about ""public deaths"" where she meditated on these public/well-known deaths/executions... One of them involved the death of a child, another was execution after torture, another was a mother speculating how she would kill her own child rather than give conflicting political insurgent groups a chance to do so... Anyyywayyy, one of the members of the group was a new mother, sooo I put out two different paths we could take as a discussion group - in path A, we talk about the death poems, in path B, we talk about ""lighter"" topics (I'd also read Stag's Leap, about Olds's divorce) and included poems from both paths and discussion topics for both as well. Well, the new mother didn't show to the discussion group (for unrelated reasons), and in fact a few other members were absent as well - there were only three of us that day. They voted to do the death poems and we had a really fascinating discussion. I know book clubs don't allow for keeping your options open like this, but I was grateful to be able to come up with both discussion topics, AND was grateful the guys chose what I had wanted to talk about and were really into it.",""

It ended up being surprisingly well written and sooo over the top but there was heart to it hidden throughout the outrageous smut. It immediately got people comfortable with each other and we went to a local brewery, brought out our knitting, and discussed it at length. Only a few of us made it all the way through and one of us actually confided she was erotophobic. Got everyone to drop their boundaries pretty quick and laugh together.

We now have a girl group chat with multiple ""threads"" (xxx for our horned up single friend to protect the innocence, a book club, a general chat) and have a lot of fun together.

"lqd9tx5","LightningRaven","2024-10-04 21:53:02 UTC","Yeah. Both series are better experienced if you know what you're getting into, because they demand a lot from their readers and multiple rereads are necessary to get the full picture (or at least start to have a more informed option about them), not everyone will be up to have such a different experience with their reading.","lqd7pf8"
"lqds6e6","LightningRaven","2024-10-04 23:51:18 UTC","Pay attention to the word choices. A lot of the world-building is done through them. Not just the archaic words.

Book club is still going strong too, but tbf it started as a SFF book club. I couldn't get into King Rat when a friend recommended that later, though. I need to try Embassytown.","lqds5o5"

That's the only book where that's ever happened for me -- I've warmed to books on rereads but never the opposite direction. I've been so confused by it I'm considering re-re-reading to make sure I wasn't just in a weird mood lol.","lqcxclu"

Are there any suggestions about what we can do to make this a better experience for all involved?” Then see what people say and go from there. Best of luck:-)","lqfjxtz"

I still remember he mentioned in the book how he was at Mother Teresa’s bedside seeking guidance while she was dying, and he made it a point to say it was in the winter. Anyone old enough to remember the summer of 1997 would have caught him in that lie.","lqcj0hc"

I think Choke and Geek Love are on completely different levels. Choke is lightweight compared to Geek Love. 

Choke felt like it was trying to be edgy and controversial. I was genuinely disgusted and disturbed by Geek Love. I wouldn’t mind reading Choke again for fun. I’m glad I read Geek Love but I’d never read it ever again.

I can’t think of another character that gave me major creeps like Arturo. But really great book.","lqe4jpc"

Monstrilio has a cannibalism element to it as well but probably not to the level of books on your list.","lqctuin"
"lqcu5a8","ImLittleNana","2024-10-04 20:22:52 UTC","The Exorcist is horror, but purely fantastic. TITF is horrific because it’s beyond the pale, but not so far that you can’t see it. 

I read The Exorcist, Amityville Horror, lots of Stephen King,and Helter Skelter the same year (1979). Helter Skelter was the scariest.","lqckh2r"
"lqewcio","irrelevant_probably","2024-10-05 04:54:36 UTC","Okay, so, they're always highly structured—most notably, there'll be a distinct conclusion sentence (often some kind of safety/moral advice), because AI loves to tie everything up with a cheery little bow.

Think high school student writing an essay using the hyper-specific template their teacher gave them.

This one was harder because it's a bit snarky; usually bots are just kind of blandly upbeat. But even when they're being snarky, they have no personality, and they're not allowed to say anything that could really be offensive/controversial.

Also, they can't generate original thoughts, so they rely heavily on clichés (if they're trying to be funny, it always comes across like a mediocre stand-up bit) and bland, bog-standard wording/sentence structure. Despite talking more precisely than humans, the vocabulary is always accessible. They make few to no grammar mistakes.

And they're very Leave It to Beaver. Lots of exclamation points. No swearing. In this case, the ""Oh boy"" tipped me off immediately. Even when they try to use colloquialisms, it generally sounds outdated.

Some are harder to tell than others. But if you're suspicious, look at the other comments on their account. It's definitely a bot if all their comments sound exactly the same (or there's an abrupt cut-off point where the comments stop sounding human—I think some real people's accounts get sold or something).

I'm sure that was more info than you ever wanted or needed to know. Can you tell that I HATE chatbot comments??? 😅","lqe80eb"
