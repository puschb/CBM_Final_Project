"lrvpodq","ShotFromGuns","2024-10-14 14:30:50 UTC","Reading is a ""muscle."" If you don't exercise it, or only exercise it in certain ways, it'll be less capable at some things you try to do with it. Reading more complex sentences or for longer spans of time are both things that require regular practice for most people. (Attention span can also be affected by other things: if you spend a lot of time scrolling social media like reddit, for example, that will train your brain to give you lots of little hits of attention rather than longer, extended periods of it.) ***The more you stick at it, the easier and more comfortable it will get.***

I read Thomas More - Utopia, and it took two weeks, for an 86 page book. The language was sufficiently antiquated that I had to slow down, and the concepts described in the book really demanded contemplation. 

In contrast, the ACOTAR series took a week for me to read in totality.

I REALLY enjoy digging holes and did it for a living as a tree planter for a few years just out of high school. of course, you think ""oh no, my week is so short and I have so many holes to dig"" and A) the task seems so daunting that it's hard to start and B) when you do start, you feel burnt out every 5 minutes like you're making no headway. I also felt this way about reading when I thought ""there's so much reading to be done, and life is so short."" 

in both, however, slow and steady really does win the race here. I began with breaking soil with my first shovel-full, and then do it over and over again at a steady pace learning to enjoy the build up over the ""Hump"" necessary for it to become almost automatic.

"ls24b5d","inabookhole","2024-10-15 16:16:09 UTC","I usually take a break when I start losing focus, but that happens quite some time after I’ve started reading. There have been days when I spent entire afternoons and evenings reading without taking a break, and other days when I needed a break after just half an hour... so, I’d say it varies a lot for me.

It could be that you just need to find the right rhythm, find a time of day when you can really read calmly, and gradually it’ll become easier to have longer attention spans. It might also be that the book isn’t really your cup of tea, so you find yourself needing frequent breaks because it feels boring.

However, if it’s been happening for a while and with different books or at different times, or even on various occasions, it could be a sign of something else, like a vision problem (I saw someone already suggested that) or an issue related to stress or fatigue. Personally, I found myself in a similar situation: I had trouble reading, got tired quickly, and when I had my eyes checked by my eye doctor, I discovered the cause was my glasses. After changing them, suddenly, no more problems. The environment also matters a lot; you might need a different kind of light, for example.

I'm a mediocre reader, and One Hundred Years of Solitude was definitely difficult for me just keeping names and timelines straight.

I’ve been wearing glasses since I was 10-11 years old  and I’m also a very avid reader. Last year, I noticed I was having the same issue as OP and I coincidentally had an annual eye exam scheduled. It turned out my vision has gotten a bit worse so I needed a stronger prescription lens. 

It was a day and night difference almost IMMEDIATELY after I got them. My eyes no longer felt tired and I didn’t have that strained feeling like I had to force myself just to get through a few pages without stopping. I never would have guessed that’s what my issue was had it not been for my eye exam.","lrvka3y"

Meanwhile, I read *Ender's Game* in two evenings while taking a break between *W&P* volumes, so it's clearly not just attention span.
