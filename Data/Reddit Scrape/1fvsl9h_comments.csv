"lq9jris","chapkachapka","2024-10-04 06:52:48 UTC","This has been the way books worked for 100 years or more. Take a look at the [historical list of bestsellers by decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers_Weekly_lists_of_bestselling_novels_in_the_United_States) (in the US) at Wikipedia.

There are a few familiar names, mostly “literary” writers like Sinclair Lewis who get assigned in schools and written about in universities. Then there are a lot of popular, non-literary writers whose books you’ve sometimes heard of but only because they were made into movies. (See “From Here to Eternity,” “The Robe,” “Love Story,” “Gentleman’s Agreement,” etc.)",""

"lq9ugws","Minimum_Lion_3918","2024-10-04 08:58:49 UTC","I find author fashions interesting. Jean Auel: Valley of Horses and Clan of the Cavebear was hugely popular a few years back but I'm not sure how popular she is today? She is brilliant at evoking a pre-historic world.  Back in the 1960s authors like H E Bates: Fair Stood the Wind of France, Neville Shute: A Town like Alice, and Graham Greene: The Heart of the Matter and Our Man in Havana were popular. You don't hear much about them today. Colleen McCollough: The Thorn Birds was talked about a lot here in the 1970s. 
I remember enjoying Herman Wouk: The Caine Mutiny and particularly Robert Penn Warren: All the King's Men.  Harper Lee's: To Kill a Mockingbird Bird and Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country have beautiful writing. But all these authors could write well, Greene can be wise and also incredibly funny. It's sad when these works seem to sink into obscurity.

History lessons of a place through the people who went through it. Became famous for writing Tales of the South Pacific, which was turned into a famous musical & movie back in the 40s. He wrote over 40 books, mostly fiction but some non-fiction too. I’ve read a lot by him: my favorites are: Hawaii (my first and many claim as his best), Texas, Chesapeake, Caribbean and Poland. The Novel was interesting because it took you into the book publishing world circa 1991.

Hugh Walpole was one of the most widely read authors of the 1920s, but he was pretty swiftly overshadowed by writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway after his death.

Things that are very popular are also, almost without exception, fashionable; fashions change; when they cease to be fashionable, they cease to be read.

The only real exceptions to this are first-ballot canonical writers who also achieve some degree of popularity: Shakespeare is the obvious example; more recently, you could make strong cases for Pynchon and McCarthy. But it is worth remembering that while those three were all popular to some extent, they were not the most popular. Jonson, Kyd, Greene, Marlowe, Middleton, Webster, Fletcher, and Beaumont all out*sold* Shakespeare at various points-- though Jonson notably recognised immediately that Shakespeare was a *better* writer than he was, and began agitating for the critical appreciate that would become 'the Shakespeare revival' long before revival was needed.",""

"lqbhqls","Ealinguser","2024-10-04 16:02:50 UTC","The trouble with Jean M Auel's book was the downhill progression. The first 2 books contain most of the interesting material, after that each book spends more time regurgitating summaries of the previous ones and her grip on plot and character loosen such that everything that happens seems like just a repeat of something that happened earlier anyway, and the heroine's superwoman thing gets more and more painfully improbable at each step.

The second 2 books are readable but not great, the 5th is very weak and the 6th is literally dross that basically goes A went into a cave saw/drew some pictures, went into another cave ditto.  Maybe Auel was too in love with the material to make it into an even vaguely adequate story anymore.

Also all the books are very long with those constant repetitions in. Now Nevil Shute has the merit of telling a lean story in a small paperback. Some are still read, chiefly on the Beach and a Town like Alice.

Graham Greene is a classic and some/all of his work will always be read as such but it's more likely to be the Power and the Glory or the Quiet American.  The lighthearted Our Man in Havana is just not as funny as Le Carre's Tailor of Panama. I hope the Alan Paton book will also make the cut.  To Kill a Mockingbird is routinely taught in schools and can't be avoided though the recent publication of a poor first draft under the title 'Go Set a Watchman' did her reputation some harm.","lq9ugws"
"lqa7ubj","UnaRansom","2024-10-04 11:19:32 UTC","Indeed. As a used bookseller here, I’m used to going months before selling McCullough, Wouk, Michener, Auel.

Internet is the main problem. 

Every hour spent on a smartphone app is one hour less spent reading.

And the less people read, the more special their reading time is, which makes them even more risk averse readers who want to read only what other people vouch as good reads and/or whatever is trending on BookTok, Instagram, Netflix.

Hence the vicious cycles.

The future belongs to new bookstores. New bookstores can capitalise on homogenous demand by buying more of the same title people all want. Used bookstores on the other hand will disappear, because their main selling point is serendipity (the book finds you), which is not what risk-averse people want when they look at their shrinking reading times.","lq9ugws"

Sometimes he comes up more as a critic or an influence on other authors, but also for his own works. He might not be actively popular, but he's certainly hanging around in the literary canon.

Also, I don't know about other places, but in the US *To Kill a Mockingbird* is one of the most-taught books in the high school curriculum. Ditto for Steinbeck (especially in California!), although which specific book gets taught can vary. We covered *Of Mice and Men* freshman year and even had a field trip out to the Steinbeck Museum in Salinas.

I worked in books for many years and this was always talked about, but I did find this:

“The fact is that Michener employed a bunch of research assistants over the years. Some of them were just that, but others were accomplished writers or editors in their own right who, at times, wrote some first draft sections of the books. Michener would then extensively rework these parts, putting his own touch upon them.”

“So, in a sense, yes, some Michener novels are collaborations in the loose sense of the word. They may not have the collaborator’s name on the cover, but Michener acknowledges his coworkers handsomely enough in the front matter. And, of course, they were all well paid.”

I grew up in remote Appalachia. One general store in town, one gas pump (two, if you count 'diesel').  No bookstore or library for at least an hour's drive away.  Even the school (one building, K-12, plus the bus barn) library had limited selection, and relied on the county to provide copies of all the required reading.  My textbooks were ancient: my eighth grade English textbook, where you wrote your name and year in the front, it had the school principal's name written there -- it was his copy from when he was a student at the school.

Books, in some places, can be a rare commodity.  If you're literate, and you want to read… well, sometimes you take what you can get.  And if Readers' Digest has books that can get delivered, then you get those books **and you are grateful**.","lq9w5jw"

I think one mistake I am making is not “advertising” this by, say, putting up a poster somewhere in the store that will inform customers that the main value of a brick-and-mortar bookstore experience is the pleasures of stumbling across a book.

I am probably worrying too much about the rising number of people who walk in not dor serendipity, but for a copy of White Nights or whatever is the latest viral trend.

Two questions just for clarity (not for “points scoring”):

Are you volunteer-run, or can you pay a living wage?

Do you often get customer eho ask for Murakami, Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Plath, et al, but are a bit disappointed to hear those authors are sold out?


I co-run a secondhand bookstore (14 years experience) where we buy our books, pay wages (no volunteers) and do not have tax cuts. We are also doing ok, but the structural problem remains:

Over the last 14 years I’ve seen more and more people come to the store with a to-read list on their phone. More often than not, the titles/authors on their lists are usually the same.

But because we are secondhand, our supply cannot correspond with demand — because we don’t get 15 people a day coming in to sell us 15 Murakami/Kafka/Camus/Judith Butler books. Hence my comments about the future belonging to new bookstores; or, at least, to secondhand bookstores that are flexible enough to diversify their inventory with new books.

The article seems to be refuting the idea that he was just a hack and states that he did not have ghostwriters. He had collaborators who were paid, and thanked in the books themselves.

The shop manager is paid, but the rest of us are volunteers doing a day or halfday a week, and probably we are not doing so well they could pay us a living wage and still be very profitable. Although volunteering for a charity, that wouldn't be something we sought.  We  also have the mixed blessing as a charity of getting batches of remaindered stuff from publishers or shops, which is good for being current but 6 copies of something that wasn't selling...

We receive and sell plenty of literature, older and newer, as well as mainstream fiction and yes there are disappointed customers when a book is not currently in stock and that's more likely to be Albert Camus than Colleen Hoover.  Typically we have something by Murakami/Kafka/Camus/Marquez (sorry don't know Judith Butler) but quite often not the title wanted.  We have Auel but not Michener currently.

AND we are probably atypical as we are in Hammersmith, a fairly plush part of London UK, so both the donors and the buyers tend to be a bit more highbrow than UK average. We rarely receive Fifty Shades or Dan Brown, more often endless copies of Alan Bennett, Michelle Obama or Andrea Camilleri.

The biggest turnover inevitably is crime.  We never have quite as much SciFi/Fantasy as we'd like and I don't have the Left Hand of Darkness at the moment but I do have HGWells, Douglas Adams, John Wyndham and Olaf Stapledon as well as Andy Weir and Brian Sanderson.

We stock a lot of history, politics, self-help and social issues stuff, of which the politics turns over least well. Also art, gardening and cookery which turns over best in November-December you will not be surprised to hear.

Biography is the biggest problem, we always get far more donated than there are buyers for. Oh and hardbacks of any fiction except the classics - almost nobody wants a secondhand crime or even booker prize hardback.","lqbruq2"

I don't remember RD ever claiming that the condensed books were *improvements*, just that they were for people who were short of time and just wanted to see enough of what a book was about. I don't remember any particular examples of redaction/censorship, but it could well have happened.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Reader's Digest was *everywhere!* You couldn't get away from them if you tried, unless maybe you never went to anybody else's house or never set foot in a doctor's office. They're still around, but if I see one now it's like seeing somebody I knew in high school but who had some weird bacterial disease along the way and I'm never quite sure it's the same person.

Exactly!  As someone who, as I said, grew up in Appalachia, where the nearest full grocery store was an hour away, provided the roads were clear and not snow-covered, we were grateful that the small in-town store -- just the one! -- had canned food available in late January and February.","lqaw7cx"

Full books were expensive.  But with RD, you could get four or five new things to read for the price of one.  Often, they were second-hand.

Twice a summer, the county Bookmobile came to town. They had a lot of RD books that you could keep, rather than have to return on their next visit.","lqawkpn"

*In 2001, 32 states' attorneys general reached agreements with the company and other sweepstakes operators to settle allegations that they tricked the elderly into buying products because they were a ""guaranteed winner"" of a lottery. *

*The UK edition of Reader's Digest has also been criticized by the Trading Standards Institute for preying on the elderly and vulnerable with misleading bulk mailings that claim the recipient is guaranteed a large cash prize and advising them not to discuss this with anyone else. The ASA investigation upheld the complaint in 2008, ruling that the Reader's Digest mailing was irresponsible and misleading (particularly for the elderly) and had breached three clauses of the Committee of Advertising Practice code.*

Not in the USA or UK but I remember those fat envelopes about already winning the lottery, how lucky we were.","lqaqpvk"
