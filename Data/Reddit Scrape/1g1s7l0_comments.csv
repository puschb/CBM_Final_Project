Donald Trump is certainly not a Nazi and neither are the vast majority of his supporters, we've been over this for years at this point. Nazism is obviously a heinous ideology on many levels. Of course there are going to be a minority who delude themselves into thinking that's the case, whether for or against it. But simply being at a rally where a few people express extreme beliefs doesn't mean you align with them or that you're individually responsible for their behavior. Trump has said many things that actual Nazis and people further to the right have vocally disagreed with. Even then, people simply have an ingroup preference. For example, people on the far left often voted for Biden in 2020 because they had deduced that it was the ""less bad"" option.

I‚Äôm saying people like the one in OP  hire a ghostwriter to write their book but hide the real writer‚Äôs name on the cover passing it off as their own and that specifically in opinion is sneaky and deceptive. That‚Äôs it. Stop making up other versions of that point, because I‚Äôm not talking about those, heck I probably even agree with you on some of them.","lrl4inq"

You'd have to find someone who sounds or looks convincingly like Elvis, but here's the secret, it might not just be books. It's a contentious thing right now with acting and deepfakes, who owns the likeness of Johnny Depp as ""Jack Sparrow""? With writers, a Tom Clancy type sold his naming rights to a company, but there were no such provisions or thoughts in contracts like this before so if Dinsey wants to make a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Depp, can they still use his likeness? They did it with Rogue One.","lrmwu8w"

Sometimes the ghostwriter finishes a book the original writer started or fills out a story that the original author has outlined or made notes of.","lrmwu8w"
"lrl9gd7","BluddGorr","2024-10-12 16:59:30 UTC","Then what's the difference between using a pen name of a person who actually exists if both people consent to it? If both people are getting paid?","lrl7i3n"

Then you have Terry Pratchett, who co-wrote The Long Earth series because he needed the assistance. But the pulp mill that is VC Andrews is creepy. She's been dead for 40 years!","lrod76r"

That is my opinion because from the reader‚Äôs perspective it‚Äôs sort of like stolen valor; also again I‚Äôm not talking about pen names nor have I ever in this comment chain. Okay please don‚Äôt make me hash all that again using caps and clapping hand emojis lol. Let‚Äôs just stop right now and continue with our respective lives.","lrl9gd7"
"lrlcaqj","BluddGorr","2024-10-12 17:15:05 UTC","Is it sneaky and decpetive? Like with biographies what you care for is that the content is true, not about the subject's ability to string words together.","lrlboiz"
"lrle08l","happysri","2024-10-12 17:24:19 UTC","Well if it‚Äôs not a big deal why hide it then. It‚Äôs apparent we will not agree  so how about you continue being content with the currently normalized process of hiring shadow ghostwriters and I continue to be disgusted with that particular practice. So this will be my last reply here, feel free to have the last word. Ciao!","lrlcaqj"
