Reading for expectation and plot rather than to experience the work. We all do it. I will say these books are better on rereads. 

Another author would have done things in a more straightforward way thats easy to digest.

I for one think that the books would have suffered for it.

I just want to explain this one. By all understanding of the Bene Geserit, Leto should be a possessed abomination. Now they could be wrong, but my take was that Leto dug and dug and dug into his ancestral memories until he found someone ruthless enough to do what needed to be done, conniving enough to be able to do it, and smart enough to not fully possess Leto.


Harum is in control of Leto at least some of the time and influencing his thoughts and decisions constantly. But not enough to completely erase Leto from existence. Leto basically formed an alliance with Harum granting him preferred status in the throng in exchange for protecting him from it.",""

Why does this random outpost of bandits matter? What makes jacurutu specifically matter? **When Leto goes through the spice trance, why is harum so important? Why is he even included if he’s only mentioned once or twice in throwaway lines but somehow has the importance of a possession?** It feels irritating reading 500 pages and 200 of those are just unnecessary things you will never see again or had any impact on the story. 

Many things that confused me big time are made clear in the next book, and become something I really enjoyed on my reread. Jacurutu was definitely one of these things. As was Harum, but Harum is very important for the whole God Emperor/possession thing. 

Also, Alia ended up like she did because she didn't have a Harum. Or rather, the Baron offered to be her Harum and it didn't work out. Leto/Harum is a foil to her regrettable and entirely preventable downfall. If her Mother or Brother were there for her, it could have been different. Truly a tragedy, imo.",""

I think you really misinterpreted that encounter. Duncan was in the wrong. Moneo was saying that homosexuality is rather normal in human history.

And that when you oppress expression of sexuality it creates cruelty in the species. 

When he talks of the male army he's talking about how society manipulates our sexual urges and diverts them and uses it for war. That war in a sense is an expression of the sex drive.

"ly6yusc","DonQuigleone","2024-11-21 03:07:39 UTC","My personal opinion on each book in order:

1. The OG, the classic, the reason anyone reads this series. Dune was a work of genius and did some of the greatest world building in the history of scifi. It combines survival against the elements, feudalism, ecology and freaky psychic powers into a cohesive whole. Great book. 

2. Quite different from Dune. Probably benefits from being read when you're older. Finishes Paul's story in a good way while avoiding a Hollywood trite ending. Deserves credit for giving us the Ix and Tleilax. 

3. It's readable, and continues some of the more interesting freaky body horror aspects of the series, but loses the world building and ecology, which is what made the series interesting in the first place. 

4. I personally enjoyed God Emperor at the time I read it when I was young, but I'm not sure how much I'd enjoy it now. It does finish the plot threads from the previous stories, however. It's weird and interesting in it's own way. 

5 & 6: Frankly, the timeline and setting is so far away from the original novels that they may as well be a different Sci fi series entirely. Frankly, I'd recommend these be ignored, and they generally lack what made Dune interesting in the first place. 

In my opinion, Frank Herbert, as an author, had one moment of genius in his entire career, when he wrote Dune, and he never was able to write anything else that matched it. I don't necessarily mean that negatively, as most authors fail to have even one such novel.",""

"ly6yzta","Dimpleshenk","2024-11-21 03:08:30 UTC","I really wanted to like Dune (the first book) a lot, and I did find it to be very compelling and with a lot of what you might call realpolitik, with a terrific commentary on how religion, prophecy, government, and psychology are all manipulated and co-opted by various groups. I also enjoyed its take on the Joseph Campbell-style Hero's Journey as well as a commentary on the limitations of adherence to that trope. There's a lot of ""he's the chosen one but he knows he's not really the chosen one, but because he has the humility to think he isn't the chosen one, he really is the chosen one -- but actually he isn't and he becomes as corrupt as everybody else, and...."" The story seems to follow a Messianic pattern but then subvert it and turn on it, and it's almost like an ouroboros or Mobius strip of expectation and meaning, or something. After a while I kind of gave up on trying to make sense of it, though -- it is more like a fever dream and just something to get caught up in for its own epic sake. It's like a big slimy worm that you wrestle with but it doesn't want to be pinned down to any one conclusive meaning so it keeps wriggling and morphing as it goes along.

All of that being said: Once I realized that the story keeps going, and that Paul becomes corrupt and a bunch of other stuff happens, I decided ""I don't care about this -- it's too much."" Based on the description of later books, it seems like the writer was just piling on to keep making money, or to please fans' expectations, or....I don't know what. But I don't like the idea that ultimately there isn't that much of a point. I like book series' where the author has a grand plan and the whole thing holds together, not a book series where it's just dragging things out and one damned thing is happening after another simply because the world marches on.

"ly6zweu","zephyr_555","2024-11-21 03:14:03 UTC","CW: Major series spoilers for those who haven’t read all 6 books

As far as Emperor Worm: The main theme throughout the series was always meant to be the Danger of a Charismatic Leader. Unfortunately for Frank, the readers, at the time largely consisting of young men, strongly identified with Paul and focused on the cool factor even as Paul not only compares himself to Adolf Hitler but explicitly states that he has orchestrated a genocide several orders of magnitude larger than the Holocaust and is haunted by guilt over his actions.

Seeing that he failed to get his point across and perhaps correctly assuming his readers would not understand that Leto II was a cruel tyrant that oppressed the entirety of human civilization for thousands of years in the name of some greater scheme, Frank chose to literally transform Leto II into an inhuman monster. In the later books he once more sticks to the absurd to get his point across with the main antagonists of books five and six being a cult of women conquering the universe through the use of magic space pussy (Frank was also a horny old man.)

I think Frank intentionally alienated the readers in later books because he didn’t want readers identifying too strongly with the protagonists. All 6 books in the series still contain a great deal of the action and intrigue that made the initial book so popular, but he uses various tactics to place a greater emphasis on the philosophy of the series as it progresses.",""
"ly79ys8","Raus-Pazazu","2024-11-21 04:19:10 UTC","1. The why? thing. If you were pretty critical of the following books, reread the first one again with that same critical mindset and you'll be asking that question constantly throughout. I mean, the first book is littered with wtf weird shit throughout. But at this point, over 50 years later, much of what is in the first book is part of the social consciousness. Makes it more palatable. As for what made Herbert think of turning Leto in a worm? For that, you have to understand something that Herbert set out to do, and that was subvert the reader's expectation. First and foremost, before any other major theme, fucking with the reader was paramount.

Originally, Dune and Dune Messiah were to be one book. If you look at it from that perspective, everything that happens with Paul falls nicely into the usual hero's journey. Paul is the good guy, he allies with some questionably good guys, in order to get righteous revenge against the evil bad guys. Change the name of the character and you've got the template for quite literally thousands other stories from Robinhood to the Count of Monte Cristo. Then there's Messiah. Paul is no longer the good guy. He didn't save the kingdom. He didn't make things better for the people he now rules over. Everything that he touched was made worse. Billions dead, entire royal families wiped out, every religion quashed across the Known Worlds, replaced with the forced worship of Paul as a divine being, all signs of dissent put down as harshly as possible. He brought peace in a way that would have made Machiavelli proud. Dune was a hero's tale, right up until it isn't anymore, right up until book 2, which was the original third part of the first book. The subversion of the reader's expectation. In any other author's hands, Paul would have found a way to defy his fate, stop the Jihad, to unite the Houses under his leadership, to lift the people into a new age of freedom and be the benevolent ruler that plagued tons of other stories. That's what heroes do after all, and that is what most readers expected. Nearly every review of the time that Messiah was published said as much. Subverting the reader, priority number one. Paul becoming a dictator god was a subversion of expectations, Paul's wandering into the desert and then coming back was a subversion of expectations, Leto the worm was a subversion, not sure where you are in the series to talk too much about later books, but there is a few in those as well (though lesser ones).

2.. I'm not touching that. Your analogy is bad, and gross, but good analogies are hard to come up with and I'm no better at them either. It is a setting with mutant fish people breathing drugs, shapeshifters, telepathy, people somehow able to mentally control what the organelles in their cells do, drug trips that let you see the future, people able to calculate pi to the bajillionth digit in a second, shields + lasers = nukers (seriously? the fuck kind of idea was that one, just say the shields absorb the heat energy of a laser nullifying them and be done with it instead of the whole convoluted rationale for still having swords) verbal mind control, and others able to move like the Flash. But the worm dude was what was out of place. I often wonder if people even paid any mind to all the crazy shit that came before GEoD. Like, if I were reading a perfectly normal story of a bullfighter in modern day who all the sudden and out of nowhere turns into a Minotaur to fight the bull, sure, I'd say that was fucked up and pretty dumb. If it were a fantasy story with magic and elves and wizards and shit, then the bullfighter turning himself into a Minotaur would be in keeping with the setting. And in Leto's case, seeing all the rest of the weird shit that is basically science fictioned up magic, the worm thing fits. And more importantly, it subverts the reader's expectation. No one saw it coming, and that's why Herbert went that route. Sure, he could have just said 'Oh, and Leto noms up so much spice he lives for 3500 years.', but that would have been more boring of a route to take. Herbert wasn't always a great writer, but his ideas were never boring in and of themselves.

Frank is a bit of a contrarian in that sense. He enjoyed the slow creative process of first Dune novel that took place over several years. Being faced with immense push/time crunch to force a sequel, I don’t think he resented that. He also didn’t like his popularity being solely from Dune as he was an avid writer of many original science fiction short stories prior to Dune. My theory is that he purposely made each sequel less and less inspired than the previous book to spite everyone. 

For instance, Dune leaves off with Paul twisting the arm of the Emperor and the Landsraad and starting a Jihad on THOUSANDS of planets with his Fedaykin. Fans were anticipating an intergalactic crusade with Paul as Space Alexander the Great. Toppling planet after planet, learning to become not just a leader but a general the likes his father Leto Atreides just scratched the surface of. 

Instead Frank Herbert flipped a giant middle finger and turned Messiah into being about Post-Jihad Depressed Paul and how disillusioned he was about his prescience and how much he despised being seen as a Messiah. It had a strong ending like all the Dune books in my opinion, but the first three quarters were a political slog. Personally I really enjoyed it, loved the world building with IX and the Tleilaxu subterfuge. 

Each book after that was a bigger fuck you to the audience. Frank subverted expectations and by the time you get to God Emperor, it is just Herbert’s own philosophical ponderings compiled into a book. I’m not even kidding, he literally admitted that all the philosophy of Dune he couldn’t fit into the first three books, he shoehorned into God Emperor, with Leto II being his mouthpiece.

"ly7bjzk","cdghuntermco","2024-11-21 04:30:19 UTC","I also largely disliked the way he handled Alia throughout the majority of the series.

In Book 1, I understand she's supposed to essentially be 'superhuman' due to her mon having Spiced it up while Alia was in the womb, but that means she's able to walk and talk like a normal person at the age of two? That's just silly. Nevermind the fact she's running around the final battle stabbing people in the ankles.

In Book 2, part of the enemy coalition's plans for sending the Duncan Idaho clone to Paul was to have him seduce Alia. Who's like, what, 13 by this point in the story? And Idaho was a fully grown man? And everyone around them just treats it like a forgone conclusion this clone and this barely teenage girl are gonna hook up. I understand perception about age and consent were different in the time Herbert originally wrote the books, but this whole plotline gave me the ick feeling for my entire read.

In Book 3, it's revealed Alia has essentially been taken over by her grandfather Baron Harkonnen. And from what I remember understanding, the narrative explains that she was basically doomed to fall to possession for basically no other reason than being a woman. Hence why the Kwisatz Haderach had to be a boy. So Alia is doomed to become the villain of the book simply because of her gender.

Addendum to the Book 3 note: Paul's daughter Chani is also a woman and doesn't get possessed, which should invalidate my above argument. But then she's Paul's daughter, and because of the nature of their combined powers of prescience, she is essentially the same person as him, just in a girl's body. So she was destined to succeed in staving off possession because Paul already had, being the Kwisatz Haderach and all. All of which is to say this just feels like another 'Fuck You' to Alia.","ly70a4a"

"ly7a162","Raus-Pazazu","2024-11-21 04:19:37 UTC","3. I can't argue that one. I agree with it entirely and completely, at least up until books 5 and 6. Stakes get dialed up again, but also scene to scene more personal in those two.

4. I often wonder if Herbert had planned originally to have GEoD pick up where CoD left off before jumping ahead to the last year of Leto's reign. Most of the threads that did get dropped would have likely made their way into that transition. It is what it is unfortunately. Except for the Jacurutu thing. That's where Leto was captured and pumped with spice. It wasn't important that he find Jacarutu for the sake of finding this legendary city, it was that he make his way there to have that event occur. It was him hurtling towards his fate, which then led to the visions of the Golden Path and the sandtrout merger. That it happens there wasn't what was important, only that it happened, and that was where it would always take place. Oh and Farad’n was important, just in a secondary fashion, since he gets his freak on with Ghani and ensures the preservation the Atreides line, which I'm really damn glad was in there because for a little bit there it seemed like there was going to be some backwoods Alabama lovin going on between the twins. Granted, that would have *also* been a subversion of expectations, but at least Herbert didn't go there. I think part of his importance was simply to show House Corrino and hence Wensicia from different angles to the reader. Again, had book 4 picked right up without the time skip, we might have gotten to see a bit more of him.

5. Nail on the head there, but that's true of almost all books. Characters have to make stupid decisions in order to advance the plots. If everyone was smart about things, most stories would never happen. It's been a concept forever and a day in literature, but I think TV Tropes sums it up best calling it the Idiot Ball trope, after some sitcom where the actors would ask when reading the script ""Who is carrying the idiot ball this week?"". For me, it's like having watched a sitcom without the laugh tracks in it for the first time, and now I can't *not* head the awkwardly long pauses everyone in those shows make that allows space for the audience laughter. Now knowing of the writing technique of the Idiot Ball, I can't read something with a character doing something stupid and think ""Yup, he's got the idiot ball."" And now, you will do the same thing with everything else you read, cursed with this forbidden knowledge as I am cursed. Wensicia's plot was pretty dumb though. Not going to cover for that one. Hell, even Farad’n says as much, which means that by extension, Herbert knew the plot was bad.

6. Holy balls the man can't do naturally flowing dialogue if his life depended on it. It doesn't get better. It feels more like a 16th century play, with less flowery prose. It's either stiflingly flat, or overly melodramatic. There's no fine line between the two. There's only really a handful of characters throughout that Herbert really nails their lines down well. Moneo comes to mind.","ly79ys8"

*But,* I totally agree that classics are sometimes praised and pedestaled just cause they're classics and criticisms of them are considered invalid automatically because of their status as a classic.

I've tried classics that I felt had unengaging writing. I tried to get through Don Quixote and Moby Dick, could not.  
I read through some classics that were fun and decent with some flaws and some highlights.

But so far, Dune and Frankenstein are the two ""classics"" which have truly without any force or pressure- blown my socks off. Esp Dune, which I never considered a *classic,* and in the same light as something literary as Frankenstein before. That's genuine love.
