"lqnzt11","sibr","2024-10-06 19:47:10 UTC","I re-read The Princess Diaries books a couple of years ago and it was a WILD experience lol

I loved the books when I was a tween/teenager and was obsessed with Mia. I tried to copy her wit/pop culture references, tried keeping a diary and writing in her style, and saw her as a fictional role model. 

But reading those books as an adult… holy shit is she annoying but this is in no way a flaw of the books. She’s annoying in the way that a lot of teenagers can be annoying to adults - she makes terrible choices, she’s self-centred, and has little concept of long-term consequences. She still had her charm but my perspective was so different. 

I consider it a mark of the books being written well (hardly literary classics but they did what they needed to do). Meg Cabot wrote a teenage character who was hugely relatable/aspirational for teenage readers and I thank her for it. But as an adult, I’m sorry Mia but I’m gonna have to side with your parents on basically all of their opinions.",""

* The Magician's Nephew - I realized it's a Cold War allegory (with the Deplorable Word as the nuclear bomb). Also, I'm amused by how incredibly horny Uncle Andrew is for Jadis. 
* Wayside School - It now reads like a commentary on bureaucracy in the education system.

"lqo2tu6","InvestmentBig42","2024-10-06 20:03:05 UTC","I completely understand where you're coming from, but here's another angle to consider. Those layers and nuance you notice now in Judy Blume's books aren't just a testament to your growth as a reader but to Blume's brilliance in creating multifaceted worlds that reward readers at any age. It actually highlights how great writing can evolve with us, offering new insights depending on our life experiences. When I revisited classic books from my own childhood, like ""Charlotte's Web"" or ""The Giver,"" what struck me was not just any newfound depth but how these stories were crafted to engage both children and adults alike; it's as though these authors intentionally layered their narratives to keep whispering new truths as we grew older. In ""Charlotte's Web,” for instance, E.B. White's meditation on friendship and loss hit a different chord once I had experienced adult relationships and loss myself. It's a beautiful reminder that children’s literature isn't just for children; it’s an art form that speaks to the human condition in ways that transcend age. That said, if you haven’t already tried this, maybe dive into something like the ""His Dark Materials"" series if you're in the mood for a whole new level of complexity nailed with the same magic that captivates kids.",""

For example, Dolphin's situation in The Illustrated Mum is pretty difficult right from the beginning and it gets really bad towards the end of the book.

The endings aren't strickly happy either, a lot of the time. The characters do end up in somehow better situations but there's often a note of uncertainty as to how things will progress from that point on. And yet you still get a sense of hope.

Along the way, Alex and Colin are tailed by a psychopath.

1. How real the danger is of wickedness, in the book it’s described as boulders hanging over their heads ready to fall at any moment, dark woods or caves to be lost in, ignorant entrapment and more. These are rightfully intense depictions of the dangers of temptation and doubt that can trip us on the Christian journey.
2. The Christian journey is different for everyone, not in a way that puts Christian’s into different groups but in the way that we are made so uniquely and God knows us wholly, he knows our limits and when we should be tested, he cares for the lame (walks with a limp) and allows children to become warriors in his name and with his strength.

When I reread it, it's clear to me he actually rapes her. That's how I interpret it now.

It is written to be deliberately ambiguous, but to me, it's clear what happens.

The book is not about rape and I hope this doesn't discourage anyone from reading it. This moment serves as a catalyst for the rest of the novel, and there are two sequels.

"lqpysh1","dragonflysummer","2024-10-07 02:50:58 UTC","I also love the way Mr. Quimby reacts to his daughters' no smoking campaign! All the relationship dynamics feel so authentic in the Ramona series. The fights between Ramona's parents (even though they love each other), the fights between Ramona and Beezus (even though they love each other), the fights between Ramona and Howie (even though they are friends), the fact that Ramona is miserable having to go to Howie's after school and reasonably feels his grandmother is unfair to her (even though nothing horrible is happening) . . . It's both emotionally complex and understandable to a kid, although the adults' behavior becomes more interesting, and the reasons behind it more clear, once you're the same age as the parents.

Judy Blume is great at portraying relationships in ways they can be understood at different ages as well. Like in Fudge-a-Mania, it always seemed weird/awkward that Frank Fargo decided to stay with the Hatchers during their vacation instead of dropping Jimmy off, but it's simultaneously more hilarious and horrifying to read about it as an adult.

Then you get whiplash when you find out this great book was penned by a massive racist, like, what?

I think the best lesson one gets from prolific reading is a real broad empathy, so we as readers might gloss over or unintentionally ascribe positive lessons from some authors more troubling ideas. I read any odd thing I could get my hands on as a kid and sincerely hope my son does the same. I might end up regretting it but I think it’s so easy to underestimate what a child can work with and extract. Some overt things might stay on a very high shelf but I matured massively thanks to reading way ahead as a youth.

"lqsjh83","thaddeusd","2024-10-07 15:46:38 UTC",">For example, what’s up with the bad guys smelling like garlic??

Oh boy, this one goes deep and back thru history.

So traditionally, until about the 1960s, British and Japanese cultures have seen garlic use as disdainful,  whereas it is a staple in the diets of mainland cultures from the Mediterranean to the East China Sea.  So there is that British influence there.

As far back as the Roman Empire, there was also a classist bent to garlic, with it being seen as a low class food ingredient.

It also has ties to traditional folk medicine as an aromatic to keep away bad humors and/or evil spirits... Consider it's well known use as vampire repellent.

And then there is a racial compnent as well where ""garlic eater"" it was used as a slur against immigrants from the Mediterranean, Anatollia, Jewish communities, and the Levant in particular, basically seeing them as poor, unwashed, untrustworthy, and criminal.

These are the tropes that C.S. Lewis is touching upon when he describes the villians as smelling of garlic, whether he intends to or not: that his villians are lesser, low class, and not enlightened.","lqo1bh6"

So the whole suffering and dying aspect wasn't really something I was terribly familiar with. I went to church once with my next door neighbors who were Catholic and was quite freaked out by the large,  graphically suffering Jesus on the cross statue they had there.","lqttyqd"
"lqy77xn","atticdoor","2024-10-08 15:09:23 UTC","Aslan says to the children (who are from a late Victorian era):

*It is not certain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as the Deplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things. And soon, very soon, before you are an old man and an old woman, great nations of your world will be ruled by tyrants who care no more for joy and justice and mercy than the Empress Jadis. Let your world beware. That is the warning.*

It was written in the 1950s, when everyone was very worried about an upcoming nuclear war.","lqy59bl"

I was just reading a book about the Indian Independence, and there was a whole chapter of how much the _British_ suffered when they came to India and so many people died because they were not able to adjust to the country... And I was like... Okay... Who told you to come?? Please leave us be and stay healthy in your country! 

Stopped reading it pretty soon after because it mostly leaned pro British!","lqpj73z"
