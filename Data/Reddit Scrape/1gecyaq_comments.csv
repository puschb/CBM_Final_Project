So most kids who hate math really hate that they’re bad at math; make the problems easy enough for them to solve the puzzles at an enjoyable level of difficulty and they can become enthusiastic.

Chances are, and don’t take this the wrong way, your son is maybe below his age group for reading level. It might be worth it to try popular lower grade level books, or even just get him started on comics if he finds that embarrassing or uninteresting.

"lu8x6m5","cirignanon","2024-10-28 21:44:51 UTC","Obviously the dyslexia and other vision issues could be the problem, so good idea to look into testing for that. you said beyond the typical advice...

1. find a book series he likes, for my daughter it was Percy Jackson. Could be Alex Rider, Harry Potter, Boxcar Children, Animorphs, whatever and start reading those him. When he falls in love and wants more get them for him and allow him access to them at anytime. Slowly dwindle your ability to read them to him but let him know he can always enjoy the next chapter or book in the series himself.

2. I heard someone suggest a raunchy book I was thinking more along the lines of something scary like The Exorcist or Stephen King. Something he knows he would get in trouble for reading but maybe you allow him to read it or turn a blind eye to him reading it. I suggest those and not a raunchy book because he is less likely to get into trouble for reading Stephen King at school than he is if he has some 50 Shades of Grey type stuff. Also my mom hated it when I read my Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark because the stories and the pictures freaked me out but I read them anyway. Oh yeah Goosebumps is another series he might get into.

3. incentivize reading on his own. If he is willing to try reading for x-minutes in the day he can get x-minutes of video game time. Or he can stay up late. Maybe do like a summer reading challenge sort of thing for home. If he reads 20 minutes a day throughout the week you can order pizza on the weekend. positive external rewards work and while they seem like bribes they are learning a habit and eventually he will read on his own without encouragement, hopefully.

4. Lastly, he may have a learning disability when it comes to reading and actually physically reading a book may be difficult for him. If the tests do come back as positive for dyslexia or something like that where physically reading is hard you should try audiobooks. Encourage him to listen to books while reading along maybe. I am no dyslexic and don't know anyone personally who is so I am not sure how well that would work but I am sure an expert/doctor can give you suggestions and ideas. Sometimes it has to do with word size and spacing and some publishers print large print books or dyslexic friendly books but they are hard to find and expensive.

I was a reading teacher. Continuing to read aloud to him is great. Understanding a story and making sense of it while you hear it is as important of a skill as actually deciphering letters into words. I would suggest reading aloud to him from chapter books that are a bit above his reading level, so he's exposed to more complex stories, but without the burden of struggling to read. Not Harry Potter (since everyone's seen the movies now) but series like that. As kids we colored while our parent read aloud. But even playing games on a tablet like candy crush while being read to would be super full. It's hard to pay attention without something to do with your hands. Playing with legos or clay or something is also fun while listening to someone read. You can also play audio books in your house at set times. Like instead of watching tv, we're going to all work on our hobbies while we listen to this audio book together for an hour.

I got a bunch of kids his age into reading partly by reading aloud to them even when it seemed like they weren't listening or into it. They just played, and I read aloud, and after months and months of this, some of the kids would want to borrow the book after I was done reading to read ahead, or would look over my shoulder while I read.

Get his eyes checked out. 

If he doesn't have any issues above then the next step is take a look at how they actually teach kids to read. A lot of our school have changed how we teach kids to read. Many took out phonic. So, we have like a generation of kids who severely struggle or just can't read because school changed the method of teaching kids to read. So, get him to read to you so you can actually see where he is at in his reading skills. If he so behind and seriously struggling, you should find outside help and maybe a phonic activity books where you guys sit down and work together. Also, get him to read to you every night

His reading assistance program is of no help if they are allowing him to pick something that reads to him. Tell them he can't pick anything that reads to him that it has to be something he has to actually read.

As for word problems, take a look at what kind of word problems are being asked and make sure they aren't confusing. A lot of them just don't make sense.

You want him to be good at reading you might have to make him read.  He might not like it or be happy but he will thank you later on. 

You can make him read by telling him he has to read or no video games. 

You could turn it around and say if you read this much and tell me what happened or read out loud you can get extra video game time. 

Or use the video games, tell him he needs to play this video game that involves reading and he needs to read it out loud to you for a certain amount of time then he can play the video games he wants to play. 

You can pay him for every book he reads. So, he either needs to read out loud to you or read a book and write a summary about it. Then he gets money.  

You can also have him read small things at first like what written on a box, or a receipt, and what not. Get him to read something out loud to you throughout the day. Have him read a recipe while he helps make dinner. 

He might dread reading longer work so break it up for him where he reads a certain amount of pages or a chapter a day will help.

I'm guessing he doesn't like reading because it's hard for him. Nobody likes things they feel like they're bad at. This creates a difficult cycle where kids won't practice, so they don't improve, so they continue to hate reading, so they won't practice, etc. 

One thing to try is decodable books. These are books that contain only word patterns that he's already learned. At this point that might be what we call CVC words--consonant, vowel, consonant, like sun or box or hat. He might be farther along than that and ready to handle CVCe words (like, home, bake...) or vowel teams (rain, boat), etc. Anyway, ask his teacher and the reading specialist where he's at; they may well be able to send home some printable versions of these. Reading those, over and over, will help him build confidence and fluency. If he gets stuck, he actually really does have the skills to ""sound it out.""

Instead of pressuring the kid to read:

* read to him as often you can (it does help! It takes time), making sure that it's done in a way where he _can_ see the words/read along
*  keep subtitles on for anything he watches (you can use the excuse that it makes it easier for you to follow what's being said, rather than making it seem like pressure for him)

He had to have an operation; regular eye exams didn't pick it up.)

Elsewhere you mention that his sister is making out like a bandit off the $1/book rule.  That could be very discouraging.  Personally I would end the dollar incentive program.  I wonder if knowing his sister reads easily is a problem for him?  Maybe he secretly thinks he is stupid and is protecting himself from failure.  Maybe he sees her celebrated for her reading ability and feels like there is no way he can catch up.  This could be very demotivating.

What are his favorite subjects?  Hit up the librarian sub and ask for reading suggestions.  An elementary school teacher I knew with 30 years experience said, ""We don't really teach kids how to read.  They teach themselves.  The way it usually happens is they find a book they love.  It's helpful if it's a series.  \\[Like Biscuit the Puppy.\\]""  Deltora Quest was popular in our house.

Can you write stories that involve his pets or things he loves?  Personal stories that are only for him--sister not allowed--could work.  Use a simple vocabulary, build on the words he knows.  Print them up in little booklets.  You could even make the booklets into scavenger hunts or descriptions of fun things you are going to do in the next week, where the thing you are going to do is a surprise to him until he reads the story.  Work with the things he loves and get creative.

If you feel he has a real block about this, you could have a conversation with him.  My nephews knew I had a PhD in linguistics.  When one of them was seven, he asked me if there were some kids who couldn't learn to read.  (His younger brother was a very good reader and speller, better at 5 than he was at 7.)  I talked to him about spoken language being a natural linguistic ability and reading & writing being an artificial thing that 15% of the population has early trouble with but that everyone can learn.  I think he had a deep insecurity that was calmed by real facts.  Within a year he was reading the Silmarillion, if you can believe it.

Reading is only half the job.  Print up a vocabulary list of words and give him the job of writing little stories.  Writing is much easier if you have a sheet listing some nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

Ask him to tell you a story and type it up as he talks.  Then print it out and make it fancy.  Put pictures in.  Put his name on it.  Ask him who he would like to dedicate it to.  He wrote a book!  Maybe he'll be interested in reading it to you--it will be the easiest complicated book he can ever read.  (Because he wrote it; he knows the story.)

Type up ""room service"" type menus and let him study them and choose dinner or a weekend breakfast.  My nephews loved doing this when their parents were out of town.  Each meal had a variety of options; they would study the menus and circle what they wanted.  When they realize reading is a tool that will help them get what they want, they get excited.

Get a Madlibs tablet.  Some kids go absolutely crazy for them.  Make a big deal of how funny and absurd the story is.

I would encourage you to possibly get a tonie box and get some corresponding books that go with the figures so he can listen to stories and follow along with a book- it removes you from the situation and gives him some independence with literacy which is a great first step. Listening to stories and understanding the key concepts of a story are super important in empowering early readers. 

Something else that is great is integrating literacy into activities he already likes. For example if he's good at math use math stories to have him complete some practice problems. If your child's teacher doesn't have any you can find some online you just need to know his level. Make a menu and let him order dinner once a week but he has to read it to you. write out some labels and put them in our house/ apartments that spell out simple things like ""light switch"" ""kitchen"". 

I would also encourage you to read the book 'Thank you, Mr. Falker' one for yourself and also to him. Ask him how it made him feel. Does he think the girl in the story is smart? Gauge his reaction. 

When you're reading to him begin asking leveled questions. 1)- literal questions to ensure hes comprehending, 2). inferential questions like what do you think will happen next? What do you think is happening off the page etc 3). text to self type questions -how would you feel if that happened to you and 4). further thinking.. what do you think will happen now that the story is over, how would you rewrite the ending. DO you think that was fair etc

Check out Reading Rockets website and Brightwheel for specific reading games etc that help encourage young readers!

When I was a kid I don't think there was any of that but I know we've started to acknowledge different learning types and try to account for those since I was a kid.

I don't have kids and am only so good with kids so this maybe terrible advice. Try to learn specifically why he doesn't like reading. If you've been reading to him forever he might be embarrassed that he doesn't read as well as you or something else. Everyone learns at different rates and he could not even really have any sort of serious learning or reading disabilities but rather is just a step behind others. From experience, even if you don't have those disabilities, being a step behind is enough to want to focus on other subjects or other show other signs that your son has.

There's a reason your son doesn't like reading, and unless I missed something, from the sound of it you're not really sure what the reason is. I would try to figure out what that reason is in a ""no pressure, no consequences"" environment. He's probably witnessed other kids being bullied or made fun of for anything even resembling learning disabilities so it may not be easy for him to share what the true reason is. But ultimately if you don't know what the true problem is, there's no way to fix it.

It could be some sort of learning disability but it could also be that he's just a step behind everyone else and he chose to abandon it altogether because another subject is more fun and comes more naturally, and by doing so, avoids any possible embarrassment from the other subject.",""

My other question is when you say you let him pick the books at the library is he picking things appropriate to his reading level?

"lu94qx3","colemon1991","2024-10-28 22:25:17 UTC","A child will not be able to describe why they can't do something. They don't have the words.

It sounds like he may have a disorder but doesn't know how to say it (or fears being judged). And there's nothing wrong with having a disorder. But if he never knows why he can't do something, then he's always going to beat himself up over it.

No one asks to feel impaired, disordered, or handicapped. Just like we don't control what day we're born, we don't control how our bodies form at birth, what ""defects"" we have, or what genes we end up with from our parents. No one wants ADHD or high cholesterol or poor vision. No one gets to choose their natural hair color. No one wants an autoimmune disease, endometriosis, poor testosterone/estrogen production, or Parkinson's. But we all assume that what we are is supposed to be normal or the norm when we're young and failing to meet expectations just makes us feel broken and flawed - even though it's not even our own faults.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who had an experience or two of ""get over it"" or ""figure it out"" when it's something beyond your pre-adolescent abilities. And I'm positive your 8-year-old has something he doesn't know the words of, the symptoms of, and/or a way to describe it. I mean, I was in college when I learned what a ""floater"" was in the eye and I only learned that from *Family Guy*. So even in your 20s and beyond, there's always a chance there's something in the shadows preventing you or someone you love from meeting societal standards, but needing help doesn't mean you're broken. There's a reason we have a lot of stuff to prevent bad things from happening to us (sunscreen, pasteurization, seat belts, flotation devices); so think of it as preventing something from being an obstacle in your life rather than an admission of being less of a person.

It sounds like you're already moving in the right direction on this. You don't know what's wrong, you're one person, and you don't have the same life experiences. Thankfully doctors have a better understanding when diagnosing these things now than 10 or even 20 years ago. Any diagnosis should be really quick, and you should see improvements almost immediately (just knowing it's not his fault will do wonders).

There may not be any need for far/near sightedness, but the prism is a game changes for those with strabismus. 

I was 32 years old before my eye doctor discovered this, and I've always had trouble wanting to read. When strabismus is uncorrected, it's common to have double vision. Relax your eyes until you see two of everything, that's basically it.

Start low increments( 30 seconds, read 6 words out loud) then reinforce with the games, library book, you reading. If you learn about shaping in the area of behavior it will make more sense maybe. You are attempting to increase a skill you want in your child, research supports the use of ABA ( applied behavior analysis) in doing so via research of positive reinforcement ( which if someone tells you is bribery, they clearly haven’t even bothered to google positive reinforcement). Good luck and if your son does have a skill he needs extra practice on but has to put in extra effort for some reason, ABA will help you.

"lu9istl","Wise-Vegetable1866","2024-10-28 23:43:36 UTC","When I was a kid I hated reading. It was mostly because in school they had us read a paragraph or two out loud in a circle, which wasn't a strength. As I got older, I learned to love reading. I think some of this fixed as I was no longer forced to read out loud in a group setting.

I think it also helped when there were a lot of programs when I was a kid that encouraged reading - the Pizza Hut book it program (as far as I am aware this is still going), Wishbone and Reading Rainbow on PBS. Beyond that, we had to do book reports. I only didn't like the presentation part.

It could just be a phase. It could be books that are being given to him that he has no interest in. However, since you are letting him pick any book(s) he wants at the library, it's hard to make an argument for not being interested, just going through my own list of things it could be.

Personally, I am a fan of the Pizza Hut book it program - I would love for that to be available for adults (just me?)

I have heard of parents that will pay their children to read books. The parents that do that choose the books and they are specific books that they read that aren't the fiction books. They tend to do this when the kids are in upper middle school or so. They are having their kids read books by James Allen, Wallace Wattles, Stephen Covey, etc. But maybe that is where you can start.

At this time of my life, I don't have any children - but I have seen headlines about schools not really requiring students to read books. They are given paragraphs or sections to read, which are apparently used for the test questions that come next. True or not, I can't speak to. However, if this is correct - I would think this could be part of the problem. Part of the article I believe also noted that due to this, reading comprehension (unsurprisingly) was deteriorating.

1) Get him seen not just for dyslexia but any learning/processing disorders also sounds crazy but seizures I had epilepsy but focal seizures are common in my family and my cousin is dyslexic with focal seizures and he sounds just like my cousin a few years ago…
2) Cut back on the IPad and online time he needs to process and think for himself and we see how fast kids imagination weakens in the library but I’ve watched parents cut back and kids flourish for example we had one girl that could read somewhat but after six months of limited iPad and therapy she loved to come in and chat your head off which shocked us all. Also if he is diagnosed with seizures that will be big they told my mom when I was diagnosed no white light/fluorescent ten years later with my cousin it was iPads and computer on top of everything else.
3) I learned to read by following along with an audio book it was a program that worked 10+ years ago and eventually they got me to read on my own by following but I know some classmates in this IEP class struggled forever and he might so you find ways to make it a workable life skill but not a hobby I personally will read a physical copy anytime my husband he’s all about someone reading to him.

I ended up reading several books including a 5 book series over the span of 4 weeks, because I had nothing else I was allowed to do. I think I was 11 or so at the time.

Not suggesting you ground them unless they've done something to deserve it, but its hard for books to compete with the dopamine hits that electronic devices give kids these days.  Streaming Youtube and playing on cell phones--I think is pretty unhealthy for young kids, because it's addictive.  You might have to set a goal for him to achieve, if he cant achieve getting his reading skills up for example, he'll be grounded from electronics.  Maybe if he has something to work towards so he doesn't lose that other stuff, maybe it can motivate.  Dont force him to read books specifically though, it would probably have the opposite effect.

I am not dyslexic, though I do suspect that I have a form of ADHD (never got diagnosed though). In the past, especially as a kid/teen, I could never focus on reading q book long enough to get invested.

In my mid-20s I discovered my love for audiobooks. And I'm listening to them every chance I get, typically while cooking, after my day's work. It opens up a whole new world of entertainment and education in a way that is simply a lot more accessible to me. 

Very recently, now in my 30s, for the very first time in my life I finished reading an actual paper book. How come? - I've been reading it aloud for my partner. My partner loves reading books. This particular one was a present I gave them for their birthday, a book from my favorite author who I wanted to introduce to them.
One evening my partner asked me to read a bit to them, so I did. Just a few pages at first. A few more the next day. And soon we got through the entire book, me reading aloud to them every evening, a few chapters at a time.

We're now working our way through the entire bibliography of my favorite author. I think what makes this work for me is that I already know the books (in audio form) and that reading them to my partner makes it feel less like a chore and more like a couple's activity, a little bit like going on a date. Plus I get to introduce something that I already live to them and can answer questions.

I still don't think I'm going to pick up a book to read just for myself any time soon. I'm in love with audiobooks, but I still find it hard to keep focusing on silent reading long enough on my own. But this - reading to my partner - I will probably keep doing for ever now.",""

I guess it engages a different part of your brain and leaves you less room for other random thoughts to throw you off.

He can read well but chooses not to so here are a few things we've tried.

First though. 

Like many others have said PLEASE get him assessed for dyslexia or try any of the suggestions from dyslexics to aid with the physical act of reading he sounds EXACTLY like my sister at that age, she has dyslexia and only as an adult did she feel comfortable expressing how frustrating she found reading becauee it was something she wanted so desperately to do and enjoy but she jusr couldn't. 


Absolutely nothing you try will work if he has an underlying condition that's just straight up making this hard and unpleasant and it will affect every aspect of his education going forward. 


That said other things we've found work for encouraging the actual sitting down and reading a book :


Reading to a parent whilst they get dinner ready /fold washing etc something that means my son can just read along as his own pace and not feel the pressure of 'we are sitting and reading now ' bonus I don't get bored listening 😁


Reading before bed. We made it part of his routine, he goes to bed half an hour earlier and can read by himself absolutely whatever he wants. I record this in his school reading record as well so once your confident he is reading properly that means homework is also done. 


Audio books. My son doesn't really care for them but my sister found them helpful to listen to then read a book or listen and read. 


We rewarded every book finished with a Lego set in the early days (he was 4 we could get away with those cheap tiny one lol) maybe a Pokémon booster pack or something? A little reward for finishing a book until it becomes habit and perhaps a bigger reward for finishing a difficult book so he has some incentive. Not food. 


My son also has ADHD and we found he was struggling to sit and read so we stripped an old phone back to absolutely nothing and put kids Spotify on it for him. He uses that to listen to music and read. It's better than the tablet because it has NOTHING else on it to distract him only music. 


DON'T punish him or hold it over his head or tie important things to reading. It will change reading from a fun leisure activity until a chore and punishment and it is really hard to get enjoyment back once something has been used against you like that. 


You may have to accept he'll only ever achieve good enough reading to get by in life (and he will very very few kids come out of the education system illiterate)


I'm not sure my son will ever love books the way I do. He's got good reading skills and comprehension so he'll do fine in that aspect but I would LOVE for him to share my love of books and .....

"lubkdu5","wrenwynn","2024-10-29 09:08:06 UTC","This is pretty common behaviour in kids that can't read but are too embarassed to admit it. Talk to the school about what literacy tools they use in the reading assistance program. A lot of schools use whole word reading techniques, but these don't work that well for any but the brightest kids who are able to learn despite being taught with a less than optimal technique (I used to work in exactly this field helping to design reading programs).

A lot of kids bloom as readers using what are known as *explicit instruction* techniques - the main method being phonics. If you google phonics teaching materials there should be lots of free material available, but don't go based off his current age or grade level. Go back to the earliest years to make up for what he has missed.

The other things to do would be to speak to your doctor to have his eyesight checked & have him checked for learning disabilities like dyslexia etc. It's important to sort it out as - like you point out - an inability to read will soon start to impact on his ability to solve problems in maths, science, geography, history etc. The good news is that he's young enough that with an intensive program he should be able to catch up to his peers relatively quickly.

My dad tried when I was little to force me to read the books that he enjoyed as a child. And by force, I mean *force*.

He would ground me if I didn't read as much as he thought I should. He would yell at me, etc. The drill was that he would expect me to read when he was at work (in the summer, btw, when all kids were outside playing) and he would come home and question me about what I read. Then the grounding and yelling would happen because I wasn't interested in those books.

I ended up being an avid reader, but only when I found books that interested me.

It results in 1st-graders reading 3x slower than their peers, and having a headache after finishing one chapter of a book. This can spiral into an unwillingness to read later in life, and can be very difficult to unlearn. Because unlearning three-cueing is necessarily in order to learn phonetically.

I only ask because your description of his unwillingness resonates with a lot of what happens to kids taught via three-cueing. Unwilling to read to figure out what to do in a video game is a particular red flag here. That goes beyond preference, and into reading apparently being something difficult for him that he wants to avoid.

I was not taught via three-cueing, but I remember I really started reading myself when my parents would read Harry Potter to my sister and I before bed every night. At some point, they got “too busy” or it got “too late”, and they stopped reading it to us, right when the final stretch was getting good. So I got impatient and started reading the rest myself.

"lucknrf","Thumbs_of_Green","2024-10-29 13:53:48 UTC","I have dyslexia - and dyscalculia - and I also avoided reading when I was a child because it was so stressful. When you can't keep the letters in the right place, the thought of having to read word after word on a page full of squiggles is a nightmare. Spelling tests in primary school would induce panic attacks because it made me feel so bad about myself to get consistent zeros. 

What worked for me was making sure I understood what a word meant every time I came across a new one. I would look up the definition and write both the word and its meaning in a notebook. I would sound it out and then get members of my family to say how they pronounced it. This way, words stopped being about specific spelling but more about meaning and sound. It took a lot of work and there were - and still are - slip ups. The worst was when I turned in an book report about Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe only I didn't spell Virginia correctly. Mortification, couldn't look my English teacher in the face for a week. 

For your son, you need to help him find his motivation for reading and help him read the way words make sense to him. For the life of me I still can't spell resteraunt, even though, hand on heart, I honestly have an MA in English. No matter how hard he tries he's never going to read the way people without dyslexia do, it would be like forcing a colour blind person to paint in accurate colour. 

Your son deserves to have his own unique relationship with words and physically being able to read and spell them is only one part of the puzzle. What things interest him? Does he like trains? They can be broken down into parts and motion, ask him to describe the hiss of wheels as they pull into the station; or the people who are waiting to start or end their journey. How about trees, which is the biggest; which does he like best; if he had to pick one to live in like a squirrel, which would it be? Can he use words to create an image in my mind of yellow leaves falling onto wet pavement, to describe the crisp smell of autumn rain? 

A book is merely a sample of the world, distilled through one mind to another. If your son's mind struggles to capture language in written word, then allow him to understand it through his own association first. That way, he is more likely to treat reading like a companion rather than a humiliating enemy. It will take him longer, but that might be a good thing. Teach him the power of words and how he shouldn't cheapen them with ill use. 

And if he tries and tries and can't make sense of it, then there is no shame in accepting one weakness while another strength grows. My dyscalculia is far worse and, as such, I can't do anything with numbers. No matter how hard I've tried, the study sessions and homework clubs and supportive teachers, the numbers just flip inside my head.

They'll be more motivated to read something they take interest in than reading something being shoved in their face. I remember being forced to read books like Harry Potter at a young age in order to earn play time on video games or the internet... Sure it sort of worked but it also caused other issues down the road for me. I'd be told to read something like 16 pages... so what I did was just read the contents of every second page to speed through it and when quizzed on the contents I would have a close enough idea of what was said or done to have a close enough answer. I now struggle with misinterpreting stuff I read because I've gotten into the habit of skipping words, sentences, or even paragraphs in text.

I find I read more and focus more on reading when I am invested or interested in the topic. I don't tend to read long form content like novels but short stories are great. I have read a handful of books but I find comics and manga more pleasant to read as a person with dyslexia. Oh also watching movies or anime with subtitles on has been great for improving my reading skills. Especially when in a noisy environment or when the volume is a bit too low to hear what's being said. Having pictures or videos that go along with the reading content really helps push through the content without getting stuck or confused from the words read (I have to sometimes re-read stuff because it didn't make sense the first time or I skipped a crucial word in a sentence).

Other times have your son read a page and then you read a page. Then maybe you could read side by side with him. Another tip is to buy some colored overlays to lay over the print. Particularly green and blue. These can help a child focus on the print. Additionally a reading wand can help guide, or a piece of construction paper that holds his place on the page.

My suggestion is to reward any relaxed action by your son when he’s near books, and to simultaneously avoid pushing the topic for a while. 

In order to reward a relaxation in the presence of books/reafing, you will do something like read a book in his presence while he is playing something else and when he comes to you finally you just put the book down and reward him with praise and gratitude for him existing (I know it sounds weird but it’s the simplest form of reward!). When he is done being praised then you can continue with this or move on and come back to it later.

If a disorder isn’t the case, I used to use a book mark to cover the lines below the line I was reading.

I’m not old by any means, but I mostly blame TikTok and YouTube, where most kids get their content from. They’re mostly videos where they’re being talked to or at, and they don’t have to do the “hard work” of reading a story when they can watch it or hear it. 

Kids would rather watch the movie than read the book, but what I started challenging students with (and you might can try this) was to read the story first together, then watch the movie to view the similarities and differences from the book to film. I tried teaching them media studies as well as literacy. 

It worked for Percy Jackson series, they got really into the book, but were disappointed with the film version. 

You could also try A Series of Unfortunate Events, Harry Potter, Coraline, Aragon, The Hobbit, or Narnia. As these all have adaptations of some kind. 

I also suggest to keep reading to him and let him read to you. Tell him you need a break from reading and want to hear the story read from his voice. Don’t encourage his laziness, rather start short story level and work your way up to the chapter books. Anticipate boredom, but apply the power of reading comprehension by asking why the section is boring, give examples, because then he’d have to do what is expected of him in assessments for ELA. It’s not just reading the book, it’s understanding why the author wrote the book, who these characters are, why the world their in matters, how does it relate to the real world, and the biggest question of the next generation “how does it apply to me?”

You are an amazing parent for reading to your child since birth; I commend you and kudos to you. You have done more than my generation of parents have done. The struggle to show the importance of reading in every day life to students AND parents was always a losing battle for me. (Part of the reason I left.)

Teachers are becoming more aware of student populations that learn better audibly than visually. We, as a society, are more dependent on technology to teach our children than ever before, which has created a generational gap, so-to-speak. If your son is not falling behind, he may never ""enjoy"" reading, but rather view it as one of those necessary tasks.

First, find out his functional barriers to reading. Second, do research on ways to support his reading skill development at home & practice sentences (preferably on topics that would interest him). Third, create sentence building games using words posted on magnets, blocks, or clear building shapes. Have him come up with sentences after being shown a picture. Tell him a phrase and have him build it and read it back to you. You can even make a reading hopscotch game. You can also build a cardboard box obstacle course and put stickers, drawings, and words for an ""I Spy"" challenge with a flashlight. Fourth, do ""mini reading challenges"" of a paragraph an hour at home. It's important to get him things he is interested in reading or learning about. If you have to, use interactive books with fidget toys built in to correlate with the story. You can also get choose your own adventure books. Goosebumps has lots of those. Gradually, he will read what interests him independently. ",""

Invisible ink escape room puzzles that add a level of excitement to reading. Rewards hidden in secret notes like a coupon promising to take them to their fav ice cream shop/get the game they've been asking you for when they locate that note, solve the riddle, math problem, etc.

Turn words into rewards: DIY puzzle of a short story or joke you know they'll enjoy, cut up into almost identical shaped pieces so they have to pay attention to the letters and words and sentences to make sure they're all pieced back together properly. Then they can read the story once it's all assembled. This can work with a combination of pictures and images. Memes will probably work pretty well tbh 

Reverse psychology forbidding them to read something (ex. do they seem to like horror? Tell them a certain book is too scary for them and they probably couldn't handle it. Do they like magic? There are powerful spells or tricks in the book they aren't skilled enough to perform safely yet. Are they eager to grow up and be treated like an adult? Telling them they're not old enough to understand yet...Etc)

My mom used to teach kids with special needs so she took it upon herself to teach him. She bought a homeschooling reading program and sat at the computer with him for hours. She made him from cardboard and duct tape one of those line blocker things that hides the lines on a page except one so you can focus on one line at a time by moving the clear section down the page as you read. She bought him books that he was excited about reading and made library/bookstore trips into a fun outing to further excite him about reading. She read aloud to him many many times. Once reading stopped being such a challenge for him, he fell in love with reading and books were on his  Christmas list every year after that. So I guess the biggest tip I can give you is to get your son excited about reading however you can and don't despair! He will probably not learn to appreciate reading until he's developed more skill and can travel through stories witbout having to constantly use brain power to understand the words. Also, enable subtitles on your TV. It's an easy way to passively get more practice on phonetics and sight words since they're constantly running on the screen while you watch.

It can lead to blurred vision even if “regular” eyesight is fine. This can obviously make reading difficult and can even cause headaches. It can be corrected by a series of exercises.

As he improves, I would make the books longer. Once the books are longer, he doesn’t have to finish them in one day but maybe read a page or two a day. 

Great skills to work on are segmenting words, blending words and working on recognizing sight words without having to segment and then blend them (lots of videos on YouTube you can check out for each skill and how to prompt/grow it).

I would get so excited to find out what would happen in the next book (we were reading Harry Potter and Series of Unfortunate Events as they were released) and we would talk about them constantly.

Your post is almost exactly what I was going to say, you have to keep them at it until eventually they find a book that clicks for them and pulls them in, for you it was Harry Potter. Had you not been forced to read those earlier years, if/when you discovered Harry Potter you likely wouldn't have been able to read it due to a lack of skills and ability.

Barring some learning disability, I think it's one of those skills you have to keep at until you find a book or genre that works for you.","lu8qrhs"
"luclnla","chattytrout","2024-10-29 13:59:22 UTC","> Don't force it. School forced me and I hated it up until I was 12 and found Harry Potter.

Yup. Easiest way to make a kid hate something is to force it upon them. When I was younger, my parents tried to force me to read more, and it didn't go over well. I wasn't fond of the books we had to read in school either, so I ended up using cliffnotes and sparknotes for damn near everything. If we weren't reading it in class, I probably didn't finish it.  
It wasn't until my junior or senior year where we at least had some choice in what we read. We'd have to do something like 3 or 4 presentations over the course of the year on a book from a (decently long) list that the teacher had put together. He was also open to suggestions for anything that wasn't on the list (that's how I ended up reading I,Robot). That opened me up to reading a bit more, since I got to choose what it was, rather than being told that we're reading some old classic with symbolism that goes over our heads and may or may not actually be there to begin with.

Funny thing is, I wasn't bad at reading. I remember that whenever we would take these reading level tests in middle school, I was reading at high school level or higher. Whenever we would take turns reading out loud in class, I was annoyed at how long most people would take to get through the page. So I never really struggled with reading ability. I just didn't like reading because I was always forced to read things I didn't like.","lu8qrhs"

He about 8.5 now and he's graduated onto Roald Dahl but when he's being difficult about reading homework he will still get one of the ""stuck in a video game"" books or a wimpy kid one.

My dyslexia (and dyspraxia) was bad enough that I was statemented as a kid (a now defunct UK term which has been replaced by an ECHP).

I really struggle with spelling and writing, I have very messy writing (although it’s much neater now I’m an adult, it deteriorates rapidly if I have to write fast), I used the letters b/d and p/q interchangeably until I was into my teens, write very slowly and spelled in weird phonetics and I still add extra es on the end of everything if I start writing quickly. My teachers at school all thought I was an idiot until I got the best scores in the school for maths in year 3. There are a bunch of other common tells for dyslexic children, for example being able to read incorrectly spelled words correctly without noticing the errors. Other areas that may be affected by dyslexia are poor working memory and poor short-term memory which can make dyslexics seem absentminded, e.g. I carry a small notepad or I make a note on my phone when I’m at work so I don’t forget things I’ve been asked to do. Dyslexics can also have issues with processing speed and may need extra time to work through problems. Some dyslexics read better on coloured backgrounds or using coloured filters (like irlen syndrome), for example I find it easiest to read on light blue or pale orange/sepia.

Dyslexia may occur in isolation, or it may occur alongside other neurodivergent conditions. Dyslexia is not indicative of low cognitive ability, and typically dyslexics have above average IQ.

The best thing to do if you’re unsure about a child having a learning disability is to get them assessed by an educational psychologist.","lu8pof2"

All this to say, if seeing a medical professional is not possible just yet, look up and employ at home (and at the reading center) some common dyslexic tools. (See comments here, as I'm pretty sure I saw all the ones i know listed.) And if those things help your child feel better about reading, then they need those accommodations in the classroom.

I assume you have your reasons for saying this, but ... as someone with zero knowledge of ""reading centers"" I would be disappointed if they didn't suggest vision evaluation. It would be irresponsible for them not to consider it. If money is a factor, circulars in mail often offer $99 glasses or exams, and such OPTOMETRISTS (not MDs!) have \\*years\\* of education, and with their equipment are fully qualified to diagnose vision problems. No need to involve an MD.

A crank theory of mine is about the protocol to not give glasses to children who are ""slightly far-sighted"" because ""they will grow out of it."" The handful of people I knew in this situation did not become lifelong readers.

One more tidbit - when my son could read but was not making the transition to ""chapter books"" in whatever grade (4 or something), I found out that this was partly due to plot pace. When we found ""Sideways Stories at Wayside School"" (Louis Sachar), he loved the jokes and continuous action. ""The Knights of the Kitchen Table"" (Time Warp Trio) and other books by Jon Scieska were a hit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon\\_Scieszka. Scieska's motivation was ""Statistics showing boys consistently scoring worse than girls on federal reading tests every year, at every grade level."" The books my ADHD son liked had virtually no description (""The sun was setting on the cozy farm deep in the woods"") and were very action focused (""They ran down the road."")

As a girl I scarfed up every type of book, but popular series like ""Babysitters Club"" are aimed at girls. Yes, all this is sexist - but in general, studies show that girls perform better than boys throughout elementary school. (The gender disparity doesn't flip to ""boys are better"" until puberty.) Any kid who is not into reading deserves whatever encouragement we can offer, even if it's Captain Underpants.","lu8w9ud"

"lu9960g","Imagination_Priory89","2024-10-28 22:49:54 UTC","In order to meet what the school required, we did have to read so many books that are on the school's program. I actually found the website for that program (and the app) and looked up every book we read. When she'd exhausted the schools books, I ordered our own as long as it was on the same program. We werent limited to the school's library. (Our school uses Accelerated Reader but there's others.) 

When she didn't want to read, if she'd met her points for that 9 weeks, I would just keep reading to her. Sometimes I could get her to read a page or two herself and that was fine. I'd finish it. We would reread a favorite a lot. I let her pick them out. I would use a ruler and let her sit beside me and look at the words as I read them. 

When she grew out of picture books, she started avoiding it again. I tried books with dragons, fairies, mermaids...kids horror and science fiction. I would read her the backs and let her tell me what she liked. I let her guide me a lot of the time. If she made a bad grade on a book, I never punished her for that. We would just find another book and move on. I'd ask her what she didn't like about that book. Usually there was a reason. There were times she just didn't want to read though and that's OK. I don't even read myself every day or every month. Small books are okay too. 

She's 12 and she can now tell me exactly what she doesn't like. Last week she stopped reading a book because it was written in 3rd person instead of 1st. She doesn't like books with romantic relationships and likes friendships and found family instead. I read the books she did so I could try to understand what she liked. 

Long-winded just to say...don't punish or use reading as a punishment. If he just reads the minimum to get by, that's fine. Just encourage outside of that. Make reading part of family time (which you already do) and make it a game. We would play word association or find state license plates (that requires reading) on the highway.

Yes, you do what you have to in order to meet grade requirements etc. However, I had it shoved down my throat to the point that I hated anything to do with books. I was not allowed to do anything until I had read so much every day and I still got bad grades because I didn't comprehend it and then got punished further. If it hadn't been forced on me as much as it was, I wouldn't have been so adamantly against it and probably would've found something sooner than I did and I was 12 when it finally clicked. 
There's a difference between enforcing rules and forcing it beyond that. Some kids you can and some you can't. With me, the more it was pushed, the more I actively avoided it and the more upset I got at the whole thing. And I will say this too. I wasn't bad at reading. I didnt lack the skills or ability, but I purposefully avoided it because I was bullied around it. Sometimes you need encouragement and help finding your passion and not punishment and by force.

As an adult she's come to realize that I was playing 70+ hour JRPGs that required me to read ridiculous amounts of text, use critical thinking, manage resources, practice patience, apply problem-solving skills, strategize, and all sorts of other useful skills, all while focusing on a single game and not losing interest in it over the course of several weeks. You might be overshooting a little bit by pushing all the way back to Sierra games and NES stuff. The SNES/Genesis and even N64/PS1 era are great for this kind of stuff. Even on the PS1 there might have been a few games with a little voice acting, but the vast majority of text in the game requires you to read, and the games can go on for much longer, drawing you in as you're involved with the events.

That said, OP has already mentioned that computer games simply don't work, because their son resists anything that requires him to read. If they can find something else that sparks his interest and gets him started reading then perhaps they can circle back to video games like this as a way to start encouraging reading in a way that resonates more with the little dude and keeps him practicing, but until then it's more wishful thinking than anything.","lu8tvku"

Some really good notes [here](https://lithub.com/how-to-read-to-children-tip-always-do-the-voices/) on getting kids engaged with reading together. And a great point: a kid’s listening comprehension is often more advanced than his reading comprehension.

I see that people have been curious why you haven't responded to the dyslexia questions too.

You've got him in a reading program, you're seeking out answers online, you're working with him on his homework - it's clear that you are a caring, involved, *good* parent who loves their kid and wants the best for him. If he happens to have dyslexia or something it's not your fault for not realizing or noticing. You aren't a bad parent, you haven't done a bad job, you haven't failed him in any way.

Also, even if reading is hard for him - even if he never grows to enjoy it! - when he's older he'll remember how much time you spent reading to him and recognize that for what it was - how much you loved and cared and tried for him.

We know this harms children’s ability to read. Some children just learn to read, no matter how they are taught. Some do okay by learning to not rely on the context clues too much. And some have their ability to read completely undermined by the context clues, which stop them learning to properly decode the phonics.

Teaching children context clues is teaching them to cope with being illiterate, instead of teaching them to read.

If it’s done through the child studies team in the school, they won’t give any kind of official diagnosis. After my experience, I would only recommend this route if you do not have insurance that would cover private testing. The school will only determine if there is a gap between intelligence and achievement. If you want to get something specific, your best bet is getting him to a pediatric neurologist and/or a neuropsychologist. If you have insurance they will most likely cover the costs - definitely check first! 

For the vision tracking issues, that would be separate and you’d need to find an optometrist that can perform the necessary tests. It’s not the same as reading letters off the eye chart we’re all familiar with.

It was all very overwhelming when I first started this whole process, and it’s not like everything was immediately better after it was all said and done.

He recently played a game that had an option to use Dyslexie for the subtitled and in-game text and he said it was a total game changer. He can still read okay normally, but that font apparently made a world of difference, and he was able to get immersed in it in a way he hasn't with any other before. Didn't stumble over a single word when he was reading things out loud, and got through it faster than normal.

If OP can find an e-reader with this option available and help her son pick out a book that he's really interested in reading then it might change his whole outlook, *if* he really is dyslexic. If nothing else it might be a foot in the door. He can rely on that for reading, as well as video games that offer it as an option, and once he realizes that reading isn't some terrible, awful thing, he might be more willing to put in a little extra work to manage with regular text elsewhere so he can expand his horizons.

For the longest time I just assumed he wasn’t really paying attention and so I just ignored it. Then one day he asked me how to spell a word and I told him to sound it out and it was like I had told him to do a backflip. He had no idea what I was talking about. No one had taught him how to sound it out. No one had even helped him make the connection between the letters on the page and the sounds they make. It was a completely foreign concept to him. Still thinking about it makes me cry a little bit that he had struggled so much over something so silly and easy to teach kids! And I know he’s far from the only kid to have been totally abandoned when it comes to learning how to read.

So despite having zero qualifications for that sort of thing (I was really just a glorified homework babysitter at Boys & Girls Club) I basically taught him phonics. We went through YouTube videos about the different phonemes and stuff and the sounds that different letter combinations can make. I actually learned a lot, too. He was older and obviously fluent in English so he learned pretty quickly but I could see the light go off in his head once it clicked. He was like a totally different reader because he could actually, ya know, *read*. Because in all of his years of schooling none of the adults in his life had realized that he really couldn’t read.

"ludvk57","Shrimpdriver","2024-10-29 17:55:58 UTC","You’re onto something here! He likes to do stuff, he seems to be imaginative. Here’s a couple of suggestions

- ask him about his imaginary game and write it down, maybe make it into a little story in text form and read it back to him. Maybe he can get inspired to write his own stories? That way he’d see a point in reading, being reading his own stories! Then you can suggest you give each other stories. Or share them with other family members/family friends if he’s okay with that. 

- another one is, in his vicinity, pick up a book he’d possibly enjoy, and read it all for yourself in quiet. Make sure to laugh audibly at the pictures but don’t include him in the fun initially. He’ll hopefully get curious and investigate where your joy is coming from and maybe a seed can be planted that “Books can be fun!” 

- A third one could be that you write a story “not too long” and tell him that you would get really happy if he would read it. This one might be the trickiest because he can just “I don’t want to” but usually kids like to be helpful, to feel they’re doing something good and receiving appreciation. Could be a way. 

It might feel like manipulation, but I think of it as unlocking new perspectives.","lucsxj9"
"luen939","Khaleesichick93","2024-10-29 20:13:47 UTC","This sounds so much like me as a child - I loved stories and had a vivid imagination, but reading was boooring and difficult (thank you dyslexia) and too slow. I could always imagine cooler things in my head, so why would I bother with reading? I avoided assigned reading homework like the plague for pretty much all elementary school and never voluntarily read books for fun. However, these days as an adult I probably read around 50 books a year and am in the middle of doing my PhD, which requires an insane amount of reading, as you can imagine.

Here’s what happened to change my stance on reading.

I really liked when my parents read to me at night (stories - reading = bliss), which my dad took full advantage of after repeatedly trying and failing to get me to read more. What he did was find a book (Harry Potter) to read to me that I thought was super cool and interesting, and then each night he began to gradually read less and less pages to me. It took him something like a month to get to the point where he was reading just a page a night to me. I finally got so frustrated because I really wanted to know what happened, that I just took the book from the nightstand and read the rest of it myself all in one day. I distinctly remember feeling so satisfied that I was finally learning what happened in the story and I wasn’t reliant on my dad to tell me that the struggle of reading barely felt difficult at all.

I wouldn’t say I immediately became a voracious reader after that, but I did begin to read more and more as I found more cool books to read. It all sort of snowballed from there and now I prefer books to movies and tv shows because I feel like can still imagine things way better in my head than whatever happens onscreen.

So this technique or something similar might also work for your son, as it sounds like the issue is more about the slog of reading than any lack of imagination or interest in stories!","lucsxj9"
"luae7ps","SubstantialPressure3","2024-10-29 02:39:28 UTC","My son has dyslexia. There's all kinds of theories. My ex's mother thought that Dr Seuss caused dyslexia. And she was a public school  teacher 😬😬 and a phonics  tutor on the side. 

And she also  tried to follow the diet prescribed by Dr. Linda Hazard. The Dr who starved people to death and stole their assets. She actually had an original booklet written by that psycho. So, I don't really trust her judgement on anything. 

My son is grown, he was lucky to have a really good dyslexia teacher after I fought way too long for him to be tested.

 That's really cool to learn that there is a special font. I'm curious to know which  fonts help you, and which fonts   make things more difficult. Just in case my grandkid has dyslexia. It's too early for me to really tell, she's too little. 

But knowledge is power.","lua1hb5"
"luadeiz","mpledger","2024-10-29 02:34:42 UTC","There is a font for dyslexia that you can download for ms word etc.  https://dyslexiefont.com/en/

There are also stories that mix words and pictures in the text and have a visual glossary at the front  e.g. PB Bear - https://themarketplace.inkamloops.ca/store/p646/P-B-Bears-Treasure-Hunt.html
so it's not so start-stop for kids having difficulty reading.  
They might be a bit young for OP's son though.

It sounds like he is engaged with stories so it feels like it's a problem with the act of reading words himself. Besides dyslexia there is also Irlen's syndrome - https://www.irlensyndrome.org/what-is-irlen-syndrome/

Can you create a book together about him and things he does e.g. soccer practice.  Kids like reading about themselves.  Or he could tell you a story and you could write it down.  Integrating words and photos is pretty easy nowadays.  Phones have cameras, Unsplash has free photos if you need a treasure island, chatgpt will make them up.  

One thing I did when I was a parent helper for reading was to bring in a ""doing"" book.  It was to make a paper frog that bounced and the boys really took to that.  So an ""instructional"" book that makes something might make him more invested especially if you play the incompetent - ""I don't get these instructions, can you read them and tell me what they mean"",  ""maybe we can work it out together"".","lua1hb5"

My near-sighted sister broke her first pair of glasses in Kindergarten pressing them into clay. Her vision has gotten progressively worse over a lifetime. She jokes about it though. Recent exam, guy asks ""how many fingers am I holding up,"" she says, ""I'm pretty sure you have hands.""  

My dad's near vision went to heck after surgery. He reads on his 7"" iPad (so he can hold it in one hand) using a gigantic font. I dislike kindle controls because you have to use your other hand to turn the page. I use an e-reader that lets me customize screen tap zones. I can hold it in my left hand, and move my thumb for forward and reverse. I'm so sorry you are having trouble reading. :-(","luc946a"

I truly don't want to get into a discussion on reddit where I'm defending someone else's intentions. Maybe you're right and they meant it to sound condescending, I dunno.

And yes, I read the original post, and it sounds like OP is doing a lot of good things, but they also came in here asking for help and suggestions. I'm sure a lot of the parents I saw at the library could make very good reddit posts about how often they brought their kids to the library and how many books they checked out. All those parents were also trying to raise kids who love reading. I'm skeptical that they were going to achieve that goal, but I could be wrong. Tone aside, ""Give your kid autonomy over what he reads and also try to be a person who enjoys reading yourself"" isn't bad advice.","lu980eu"
