"lvktpmh","Future_Literature335","2024-11-05 20:00:06 UTC","Fucking Tatiana from The Bronze Horseman. OH MY FUCKING GOD. Tiny, tiiiiiny, frail, dainty, delicate Tatiana! She can’t even speak out loud with an actual voice whenever her lurrrrve object is around, she can only hold onto walls and tables and just “mouth” words instead (wtf). She’s so, sooooo tiny and delicate!! We literally never stop hearing about it!! … 

… and yet she also does hard physical labour from dawn til dusk, does ALL of her family’s hard chores for them while they lie in bed ungratefully, tramps through head-high snowdrifts in the pre-dawn blackness to acquire bread during the siege, stands in line in ice storms for FIVE HOURS with nothing more than a head kerchief and an old coat, oh and can also disarm her ragingly bad-tempered, super-violent love interest (another absolute fucking moron of a character) whenever he ragingly “comes for her with his fists clenched” (again, wtf??) … simply by standing there, “tiny, delicate, utterly vulnerable” (barf) and turning her palms out towards him. As one would do to ANY six-foot-four, raging, fist-clenched man charging towards them with fury-sweat flying, right? 

Oh and she’s also so, SOOOO WIIIIIISE. Tatiana knows everything!! She sees through people instantly, even though she’s only seventeen and has never traveled, been properly educated, or even spoken to anyone outside her own family group. The second anyone gets even a tiny bit devious, Tatiana sees through them instantly! … even though she can’t even see that her own family is super abusive towards her or that maybe she should stop enabling everyone else’s nonsense by silently, sweetly doing ALL their chores for them while they eat the food she brings home *during the fucking siege of Leningrad where people are literally starving to death*. She’s just so WISE, she can’t help it!! 

Everyone from the old harpies in her home village, to every soldier she ever meets, to her own older sister (?!) is *obsessed* with her white-blonde hair, her ABSOLUTE WISDOM OMG EVERYONE SHE’S SO WISE, her teensy tiny little waist (the author goes on. And on. And *onnnnn.* About the tiny circumference of literally all of her joints (ankles! Thighs! Upper arms! Waist! Neck! BARFFFFFF!) over and *over* again to the point where the MMC suddenly starts *literally measuring her with a tape measure*, multiple times throughout the book (!), just so we can keep hearing about how teensy-tiny she is) … 

… even her own twin brother talks about her like she’s his dream girl! Just so we really get it through our dense heads that she’s just … the perfect woman. Perfect!! Perfect, blonde, wise like Athena! But above all: *tiny.*",""

In the original trilogy he's *meant* to be a deeply unlikable person who wallows in self-loathing and acts out because he thinks he's in an imaginary world where the people aren't real. And that's fine, because what makes the story interesting is that the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of a miserable little shit who didn't ask for any of this and who has extremely good reason to believe he's going to fail.

Not much to say about the second trilogy. He's a more sympathetic character, but there's still internal conflict because everything he thought he knew about this new world has changed while he was away and he doesn't have answers to any of the problems that everyone expects him to solve.

But the Third Chronicles? Him and Linden Avery are just *too* perfect and their faith is *too* unshakable, and the entire second half of that series is just an endless string of people making terrible decisions while Covenant and Avery are all ""that guy made the best decision he could so all of these terrible consequences are worth it"" over and over and over again.",""

I'm on book 8 of the series, 'cause most of the people at work love the thing, but I feel like I'm crazy talking to them most of them time. Eric is blatantly sociopathic in his dealings with people. Early in the series, it comes off as simple obliviousness, but as the series goes on, it's very clear that he just doesn't understand how to relate to other people at all. He's obtuse for the sake of it, arrogant beyond belief, and won't go out of his way for anything that isn't directly benefiting the plans he has in the moment.

The worst part is it's in first person, so you get to listen to his thought process and inner monologue and see how his thinking in a situation doesn't match his actions. He'll be thinking things like, ""I'm going to give this guy the benefit of the doubt, he's only doing his job"" while holding them by the neck and screaming ""Do you know who I am?!"" at their face.

They do a lot of interesting things in the book series, but my least favorite character by far is the main character, which is unfortunate since it's from their perspective. It also doesnt help that any side characters you might like will magically disappear to never be seen again between each book.

Honestly, if the book series was third person, it might still be a fun read, as the character comes off as a ""do whatever it takes to get the goal complete"" kind of guy, but then the inner monologuing ruins it by randomly waxing poetic about how he's a tragic figure and has to get used to loss and how immortality is such a burden (he's, like, 50 at this point when he does this).

For herself, Candy is weak, entitled and conceited.

Green Mars remains one of the only books I put down halfway through and never picked up again, I could not stand the melodrama, it was like the worst, most contrived, soap opera I’ve ever seen.

I remember recently when Matt Colville over at MCDM said that one of the early revolutions in comics was when the X-men brought soap opera plotting to super heroes, which really threw into relief what I dislike most about the X-men in general, and especially X-men 97 recently. I love the animation, and the VO, but I hate seeing the good guys get beat on over and over again, season after season, arc after arc, making 0 progress towards their main goal. It’s sisyphean and boring because you know they’ll never succeed, if they did, the story would be over.

Imagine if the characters of Neighbours, Eastenders, Coronation Street, or Grey’s Anatomy ever got their act together, there just wouldn’t be another season, and that can’t happen now can it.

It's funny because the other top voted comment (at this moment) is the ACOTAR books which have the perfect heroin and are what Quentin is supposed to be the opposite of.

I think it just makes sense, he's meant to be ""not good at being a person"" instead of a bad person, and a lot of protagonists grow from that, but not Quentin, that's not what he's there for narratively. This is why show Quentin had to be more likeable though, it much easier to sell an unlikable MC in a book of the plot is good enough to keep you reading and the MC still serves some purpose. But in show format, I find it much harder to follow a show when the MC is unlikeable (though it does not deter me, I would imagine it does deter many). I couldn't get through Warrior Nun even though crappy fantasy TV is something I'll make countless excuses for, because the MC was just super unlikeable to me.","lvkn4zk"

Her stance was pretty commonly that the MC was immature (maybe stated a different way but can usually be summarized that way). And mine would be something along the lines of “no. He/she is doing the best with information/experience they have.” Now that I’m an adult, I find I can’t finish YA books very often because of the main characters.

The adult version of him that we're introduced to at the beginning of the book is more interesting, but Rothfuss manages to completely rob that man (and the weird shit he's going to have to fight off) of anything that might have been compelling by spending the entire book, and apparently the entire sequel (didn't read it! Didn't care to!), on his dumb Gary Stu-ish adolescense. 

I feel like the better way to do what I think he was going for -- the contrast between the legend of a man and the truth of a man -- would have been to set the story in the present, and to have segments where bits and pieces of his unreliably heroic background are told. Frame these as boasts, or as rumors people have heard, rather than present them as the primary narrative.

In the movie, he’s a rake and a rogue and occasionally a cad and he definitely has a sharp tongue and a temper, but he’s also arguably the most sensible character in the film and it seems like there is a decent man somewhere in there begging to be let out. 

He’s so much darker and more violent (as in he’s an honest to God murderer) and just plain meaner in the book, but he still somehow manages to be charming in a weird way. In the movie, it feels like he genuinely loves Scarlett but is too afraid to let his guard down and admit it; in the book he claims that’s the case, but it feels more like he wants to possess her. Their entire relationship feels darker and more erotically charged in the book.","lvkojaz"

Kaladin is so interesting and approaches situations in such a way that tend to feel real.  

Shallan is fine. Mostly un-interesting, especially in book 1. ""Interesting"" stuff is happening around her for sure... But she is just sort of stumbling through it all. And coming out on top all the time. MS levels here.

Dalinar I am mixed about. I like his logic and his eventual actions... But he just goes about things... oddly.  

Adolin still feels like a background character to me. I like him a whole bunch. But he has pretty much done nothing meaningful to the plot. Just sort of the framework for Kaladin and Shallon to act upon. Sort of a foil/antagonist but friendly. A bartender if you will.   

As for why Kaladin feels and acts the way he does. It makes sense in the text. So while I agree he comes off as a bit generic sad boy. The reasoning is clear and so it works and is fine for me.","lvkqkg6"

Stormlight Archive deals with lots of characters who have mental disorders.  Kaladin is clearly bi-polar (type 2).  Shallan has some really complex disorders, some characters are clearly sociopaths.  I think the exploration of these can be interesting.

But fucking LIFT does not belong in the series.  She's a zoomer snatched right out of a tik-tok video and put in a medieval-type fantasy series.  My hate for her is a deep black hole where neither light nor heat can be felt, nor indeed believed in.","lvkqkg6"

Not only was he featured in every single part of the book, but his flashback chapters were boring as all fuck. And what’s worse is that nearly all of them were completely unnecessary, as they didn’t move the plot forward in any meaningful way besides explain how he ended up as a slave, which takes approximately half of one chapter.

He does not experience one ounce of character growth in ONE THOUSAND pages, because he’s already a perfectly righteous person who’s good at everything. Absolute epitome of a Gary Lou. Every time he spends pages and pages repetitively moping and whining, and listing out all the people he’d failed and allowed to die, I would just zone out and eventually started skipping entire chunks of text.

"lvmwsdd","Neutronenster","2024-11-06 02:46:52 UTC","For me, the Kaladin chapters are my favorites. All new knights radiant have some kind of trauma or mental illness, and Kaladin’s is depression. As someone who has been depressed, I relate to Kaladin a lot. It’s about hurting and feeling like you can’t go on, but still finding a reason to push through that and do better. However, I can imagine that his chapters might feel dull if you can’t relate to depression.

Personally, I have more trouble relating to Shallan and Adolin. In Shallan’s case that’s because I don’t like lies, while Shallan of course weaves lies, but she’s still an interesting character. Adolin feels quite shallow and vain to me though. He’s a successful noble’s son who hasn’t encountered a lot of difficulties in his life, making him much less interesting than many other characters to me.","lvkqkg6"

And we get snippets of him growing up, in spurts. A world built on wonder and mysticism! But as we come to find out- its because of this wonder, this mysticism, the magic of it all that the cost becomes so high. 

But it's the one thing Quentin wants, because it makes him special and fulfills his need to be someone/something. It gives him purpose. It's not until he can put aside such childish desperation that he finds real, true fulfillment.

Cathy and Heathchliff are types of people who IRL I wouldn't like to have any contact with. They are very selfish, egocentric, and have no empathy whatsoever. They shouldn't be liked at all. I really don't get how people fancy them as a tragic ""true love"" couple. They are deeply troubled people who were in toxic relationship all the time. 

But I also found their partners such unlikable people too. I had a hard time to empathize with them because I had a hard time to see them only as victims of the Heathchliff's scheme for vengeance. They were victims of their poor choices and deliberately choosed to ignore red flags with their partners (Cathy and Heathcliff).

Ugh. So unlikable characters all four of them.","lvlic5z"
"lvtldvr","stella3books","2024-11-07 01:19:35 UTC","I think it comes down to their personal views on the value of love and happiness, and is usually tied to what they think the role of fiction is. 

If they're thinking that fictional characters exist to play out dramatic plots that would probably not happen IRL in order to evoke particular feelings in the reader, they're more likely to say they ""like"" Cathy and Heathcliff. That doesn't mean they want to be in the same room as them, it just means they enjoy reading about them and don't mentally classify them in the same category as real, actual people. Classically, the 'best' tragedy was often held to be tragedy where the characters are driven to destruction by fatal flaws, preferably flaws that are the inverse of their strengths. Oedipus *really* wants to do the right thing even when it's inconvenient, and ignores everyone who gives him socially acceptable excuses to stop investigating the source of the plague. Romeo and Juliet's youthful naivete is what lets them follow their passions at the expense of practicality, it's why they die and what ends the feud. There's a whole school of literary thought that's about evaluating how a narrative plays with self-made suffering, where it's assumed the reader will sympathize *more* with a character who's an agent of their own destruction. Coming out of that system, it's a bit more understandable that people would say they like/love these characters- they have no expectation they'll ever deal with them IRL, they're just praising the writer's ability to evoke sympathy for characters who're inherently messed up. 

If they're thinking about the characters as *people*, not blobs of ink and imagination, you get a response more like yours. Cathy and Heathcliff make everything worse, if the characters were people in your life you'd be praying for them to break up and go no-contact.","lvlic5z"

The part that really got to me was her being a cello prodigy, her dad was a music professor at a university so he found a talented cellist there to teach her and within months she had surpassed his abilities so he had to find an even better cellist to instruct her.

I begged my parents for a piano for years and I eventually got one. Paying for lessons was always an issue and they’d always fight over who’s responsibility it was to pay so by the time I was in highschool I just started paying for the lessons myself to avoid having to listen to the fighting. I practised and put my hours in, but the notion that someone could just do what Mia did in the book is completely unrealistic and a little bit offensive.

I remember really relating to him as a young teen. It was the first book I read that kind of brought me into the world of thought regarding existentialism. I had been having so many of these feelings ""everything's phony"" but that book was the first to really frame it well for me. Not in the happy sense, but more in the ""oh okay, this is a school of thought. I'm not alone thinking about these things.""

I can obviously see why the character comes off as cringe, annoying, tryhard, etc. But to me it was a character transitioning into some level of acceptance about the existential nature of life -- and how no one really has all the answers or knows 100% what they're doing.

I only read it the one time decades ago though. Maybe I need to re-read it. I don't remember liking the character, I don't believe I did. I just remember the book feeling very profound at the time for me.

Kind of began my path down the ""nothing really inherently matters or makes sense, so you just need to face that and find the little things in life and take it all one step at a time"" type philosophical outlook.

The next book that scratched that itch for me was The Trial, by Kafka. First intro to absurdism, which again I didn't really know anything about going into the book. But it gave me a similar feeling when I finished it.","lvkqsp6"

And so:

People who like and defend Nesta…they are likely privileged people who are also unpleasant to be around. They rationalize their unpleasantness by thinking “this one negative thing happened to me once so therefore I deserve to be extremely abrasive and entitled.” When in reality they don’t really have experience with trauma but have romanticized it and want to have it. Like a preschooler who wants chicken pox because all their friends got it.

Not gatekeeping trauma, but this is just a trend I’ve noticed. When cis white hetero neurotypical just have to find some way to be marginalized because they find it to be trendy, rather than the very serious issue it is. 

Those people remind me of Nesta. “Oh no I’m a gorgeous immortal now…therefore I will be insufferable to everyone because no one understands how bad I have it.” None of her struggle was written well. She is unsympathetic and her thoughts seem shallow and insincere. It’s my personal opinion that for someone to identify with that, there’s a good chance they share those traits…or maybe are just very impressionable.","lvl7xrl"

When has she hurt somebody’s feelings or degraded them to the extent of, say, Snape’s persistent bullying of Harry, Neville and Hermione when he was in a position of power over them? Or as James’s of Snape? Or Draco’s of Neville, Harry and Hagrid, >! the latter of which almost got Buckbeak executed?!< Her constant bickering with Ron, who gave it as good as he got it, was not the same as what his own brothers, the Weasley twins, did to him his entire childhood, and which left him an insecure mess >!with a severe phobia of spiders.!< As somebody who was bullied, I personally don’t identify Hermione as one, even during her bad moments.

Look at everything she’s done for her best friends, and for Neville and Ginny, and even for Luna. >!She could have let the Death Eaters blame Xenophilius for lying about knowing Harry’s whereabouts and instead she saved his life, or at least prevented him from being harmed or tortured, because she knew he was only trying to get Luna back. In fact, she perhaps even saved Luna’s life, because the DE could have hurt her in retaliation.!< What is an example of Hermione being a bully? ","lvlam3n"

I think Volyova has more mad loner aunt energy, or perhaps senior academic colleague vibes, than anyone's ex-lover :)  

I like Bella a lot too actually. Svetlana not so much, although she was a good adversary. He said he might do another in the Pushing Ice universe.","lxcxxqd"
"lvt2jeq","cyberpunk_werewolf","2024-11-06 23:37:41 UTC","That was largely how I felt about him too.  That's what I meant when I said I don't think Grossman quite makes it to the finish line with Quinton.  He definitely wants us to feel some sort of sympathy for him, but, at least in the first book, there's nothing there.  He's just an asshole and he sucks.","lvt1fno"
"lvsv52k","alicehooper","2024-11-06 22:58:17 UTC","I am a little curious about what she was setting out to do when she wrote it. It ended up classified as a romance,  she may have meant nothing more than to do that in an entertaining way. Or she may have been overtly trying to say something about personal character or the wider conditions. I think the former is almost certain. I’m not sure about the latter- I think many things (like the KKK portion) were scene dressing and not commentary. You’re right, so much of what I see as racist always seems to come back to Scarlett and how she makes everything about her. Freud was pretty popular by that time- maybe the idea of the ego was something Mitchell wanted to explore. Or maybe she just knew a lot of selfish spoiled debs!

I think of how Little Women was written basically as a cash grab, and ended up beloved by generations. Much more thought has been put into analyzing and re-interpreting that work than Alcott put into it in the first place. I don’t think Mitchell was that mercenary, I seem to remember she had notebooks upon notebooks of material she was drawing from. I’m curious and want to check that out a little bit- if she explicitly had themes or just wanted to write a deeply involved story.","lvseg4g"

"lvmaic3","cMeeber","2024-11-06 00:33:38 UTC","Lol not really. Take the novel White Oleander…it was a phenomenal representation of the thoughts and feelings a young girl, younger than Feyre. The Hunger Games was even better. You seriously think young people have minimal thoughts and emotions that are surface level just because they’re young? I’m sorry, but no. Immature doesn’t equate to one dimensional. The writing is bad…irrelevant of the character’s ages. 

And it’s not like Cassian or Rhy’s are any better, and they are centuries old lol.","lvlv65z"

"lvqy44h","Cheap-Boysenberry164","2024-11-06 17:40:03 UTC","I can't believe how disingenuous a comparison that is. On one hand, a book about a teenager discovering fairies are real and going to live with them and dealing with hot dudes lusting after her. On the other, a book about kid bouncing through foster homes in real life. Wow, good for you. 

> You seriously think young people have minimal thoughts and emotions that are surface level just because they’re young? I’m sorry, but no.

I have children, so based on a lifetime of observation... yes, I do. That is literally how the immature brain works. Maybe read about it?","lvmaic3"

"lvnms4u","ImmortalsAreLiers","2024-11-06 05:31:17 UTC","I read the book couple of years ago. Divorce was stigmatized because Russia was very religious at this time period. Marriage was a joining of families to protect titles, money and other inheritance. Anna willingly married a much older man. Her husband was not handsome or romantic. I don't think that makes him a villain. The book never portrays him doing anything cruel to her or their son. In fact he even adopts her illegitimate daughter and cares for her. Personally, I think that Anna is trash for abandoning her son for a guy she only knew for a couple of days. She is a very self-centered and selfish person, and in the end it even costs her Vronsky.","lvn1y9k"
