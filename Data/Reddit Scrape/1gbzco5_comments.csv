"ltptyl3","jefrye","2024-10-25 17:37:44 UTC",">Along with the new novel set in the world of ‚ÄúStrange and Norrell,‚Äù Clarke is also working on another book, set partly during the Industrial Revolution in 1840s Bradford, where she lived as a child. Clarke described it as an ‚Äúanti-horror‚Äù novel, with a fantastical premise that reflects her belief that something sublime is hidden within the mundane.

Both sound fantastic and I hope she's able to realize them. I've been waiting for news of a hopeful next novel for years, so this is extremely exciting.

I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to have so many ideas and demonstrable talent but be held back by health issues.",""

>The novel reshaped the fantasy landscape and blurred the boundaries with literary fiction, making the Booker Prize long list and winning a Hugo Award, a major science fiction and fantasy prize. Clarke went on tour across the United States and Europe, and Bloomsbury later gave her a hefty contract for a second novel.

>Then, almost as suddenly as she appeared, Clarke disappeared.

>Not long after the novel‚Äôs release, Clarke and her husband were having dinner with friends near their home in Derbyshire, England. In the middle of the meal, she felt nauseated and wobbly, got up from the table, and collapsed.

>In the years that followed, she struggled to write. Her symptoms ‚Äî migraines, exhaustion, sensitivity to light and fogginess ‚Äî made working for sustained periods impossible. She wrote scattered fragments that never cohered; sometimes she couldn‚Äôt finish a single sentence. At a low point, she was bed-bound and mired in depression.

>Clarke stopped thinking of herself as a writer.

>‚ÄúIt became a problem of just not believing that I could write anymore. I just didn‚Äôt think it was possible,‚Äù said Clarke, who was later diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. ‚ÄúI just thought of myself as this ill woman.‚Äù

It's quite different than 'fatigue', although it's often conflated.

Dianna Cowern ([popular Youtuber Physics Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydgkCCXbTA)) ended up with MECFS (triggered by Covid). There is some debate on whether Long Covid is a form of MECFS, but the symptoms can be similar.

People imagine MECFS is just a form of fatigue or depression, but [how it manifests](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html#:~:text=ME/CFS%20may%20get%20worse%20after%20they%20do%20any%20activity%20%2D%2D%20physical%20or%20mental.%20This%20symptom%20is%20called%20post%2Dexertional%20malaise%20(PEM).%20After%20they%20exert%20themselves%2C%20they%20may%20need%20to%20stay%20in%20bed%20for%20an%20extended%20time.%20About%201%20in%204%20people%20with%20ME/CFS%20are%20confined%20to%20bed%20at%20some%20point%20in%20their%20illness) is completely different, even in its more mild forms. It's a biological illness rather than a mental health condition.

One of the fundamental differences with mental health issues like depression is that people with MECFS still want to do things, but they may be bedbound after minor exertions (where people suffering depression may find anhedonia - nothing brings them pleasure or interests them). Hence the author desperately wanting to write, but her illness making that impossible (which itself can cause depression, rather than vice versa).

It is generally thought the hallmark symptom is that very small exertion (different thresholds for different severity) can leave someone suffering for days with exacerbated symptoms - usually called PEM. So imagine that a phone call might leave someone with MECFS bedbound for days after with migraines, GI disruptions, muscle pain and spasms, etc.","ltpqzpx"

Close examination of the Albatross scene seems to indicate that Piranesi does at least part the summoning spell that the Other later demonstrated. 
He thrusts his arms upwards and tries to say welcome, welcome, but instead it comes out as ‚ÄòCome! Come!‚Äô and the book describes him as feeling a pent up tension go out of him that he did not know was there.   
He imagines them fusing as one angelic being, which ‚Äî I believe ‚Äî presages the fusion of Mathew Rose Sorenson and Piranesi into the Last Narrator. 
In a not-much later scene, we see him perfectly divine the future from the patterns of birds on statues, before unknowingly writing a letter to Laurence Arnes-Sayles, who then appears in the very next chapter ‚Äî as if by magic. 
In other words, there‚Äôs a lot to indicate a more spiritual connection between Piranesi and the Albatross, and how it helps him connect with the magic of the halls.

"ltt0abz","jcoffin1981","2024-10-26 05:05:18 UTC","I was very critical of this book.  After mulling over it for a long time I am going to give it a second read.  Perhaps it is because I had different expectations for the book.","ltqet65"
"ltx179s","hex-education","2024-10-26 21:55:21 UTC","It's my favourite novel in many years, and certainly my favourite SF/fantasy work since The City and The City.","ltqet65"
"ltqj9d5","orangedwarf98","2024-10-25 19:47:42 UTC","It‚Äôs on the shorter side so I would say to just dive into it. I would say the less you know the better","ltqi0cp"

"ltrlv3c","GeonnCannon","2024-10-25 23:27:49 UTC","I recommend the audiobook. It's narrated by Chiwetel Ejiofor, and booooy does he add a lot to it. Not that just reading it normally is bad or anything. But I listened to the audiobook first and I think he definitely made it a better experience.","ltqi0cp"

"lts36t9","ragnarok62","2024-10-26 01:18:06 UTC","While *Strange* had epic (some might say ‚Äúoverdone‚Äù) world-building in it, *Piranesi* was disappointingly underrealized, and I felt it was one of the more glaring problems that hurt the book. The potential was enormous, and kudos to Clarke for having a great premise and promising setting. But I felt as if the strengths of *Strange* went oddly missing in *Piranesi*.","ltqi0cp"
"ltq7zo5","justgetoffmylawn","2024-10-25 18:49:04 UTC","For anyone reading this - while severe symptoms are impossible to miss, the mild forms of the illness are often overlooked, despite affecting quality of life.

Burnout is normal, as is fatigue. If you work 80 hours a week or have little kids at home, it's normal to be tired all the time. That's not an illness (although it can become one if you push yourself too long).

The difference for MECFS is there is usually a 'crash' after normal exertion, often delayed by hours or even 1-2 days. People with mild MECFS often don't feel fatigued while doing an activity, but can have all kinds of seemingly unrelated symptoms afterward (called PEM or a crash). This can be hard for people to notice, especially because of the delay - so they often try to connect it with something they ate or someone they were around (it often feels like fighting off a flu).

So if you notice that you go to the beach on a Sunday and feel a bit tired Sunday evening, that's probably normal. If you go to the beach on a Sunday and feel you're suddenly fighting the flu on Tuesday with migraines and muscle aches, that's not normal.

If you have a Zoom call on Tuesday and feel tired for an hour afterward, that's probably normal. If you have a Zoom call on Tuesday and barely can get out of bed on Wednesday and can't digest food properly and feel dizzy, that's not normal.

And that's the 'mild' stage of the illness, because you can still do the activities.","ltq354l"

Which means they become prisoners in their own body.

Glad that you're still friends with her. Most people find the illness 'weird' and out of their personal experience (even many healthcare workers try to disregard it). Therefore, they abandon anyone who has severe symptoms so they don't have to even confront its existence.","ltq9kd9"
