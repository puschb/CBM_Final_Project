I had been reading the ASOIAF books, and switched to a job where I was driving three to four hours a day, so I got the book I was reading as an audio file from somewhere and put it on my ipod. I started getting really confused by all these pov changes and time jumps, but I knew from the first couple that GRRM is known for doing that a little bit, so I kept going. It felt so disconnected and even a little repetetive at times. I got really frustrated with it, but figured it was because I wasn't paying full attention due to driving. By the end of the book I didn't understand ANYTHING that was going on and I was straight up mad at GRRM for writing this piece of trash. Then I happened to notice my ipod switched the book chapters to shuffle mode.

I listened to the entire book on shuffle, and confused the hell out of myself. I still can't keep the timing of events in those books straight. I did get around to reading them all eventually (all that are out, I suppose), and the experience was so branded on my brain that I just can't keep it all straight anymore.",""

When I was a senior in high school, our family's dog slipped out the door, was running through the woods behind our house, and got attacked by a wild animal.  My mother and I tended to him when he got back to the house with his wounds.  We took him to the vet the next day, who confirmed that our dog had been attacked by a coyote.  He urged us to call our county's Department of Health to see if we needed to get rabies shots (since we could have come into contact with infected coyote saliva when we were cleaning up our dog).  I remember telling my mother no way in FUCK was I going to get rabies shots.  I'd heard about 15 shots to the stomach and all that shit and I was like ""NO WAY.""  Ahhhh, young, dumb and not realizing my own mortality.

ANYWAY, this whole thing was coincident with me reading Their Eyes Were Watching God in English class.  I vividly remember my teacher making us read aloud the passage that describes, in excruciating detail, death by rabies.  I shit you not, we had literally JUST finished reading the passage and I had this huge knot in my stomach like ""oh fuck I need those shots"" and the phone in the classroom rang.  It was my mom; keep in mind, this was one of the only times in my recollection that a parent was put through to a classroom, this was not something that happened with any regularity, and the timing was really exceptional.  I basically took the phone and she was like ""Listen, we are getting rabies shots and I'm picking you up early so that we can go to the hospital to start them.""

I went through a Joanna Russ phase a while back, and if you read enough Joanna Russ eventually you start thinking maybe you should read some Samuel R. Delaney. So I got Trouble on Triton and read one chapter. I bounced off *hard*. Stuck it on the shelf and never thought of it again.

Until about two weeks ago. A hurricane hit my (very inland) town. No power, no water, no cell service, trees down everywhere, floods, roads washed out, no gas stations open, nowhere to go and nothing to do except freak out about what was happening. All my usual self care and distraction methods unavailable to me, except reading.

Except wouldn't you know it, the only unread book in the house is Trouble on Freaking Triton. I restarted it and folks, it's maybe not a bad book but it is just a fucking slog. *Multiple* chapters start with Michel Foucault quotes. Unpreferred racial and gender terms abound.

I started reading the second book in the Wheel of Time series almost immediately after I finished the first one.

The second book did not pick off from where the first book ended. But I wrote it off as a narrative style. I thought the author would fill the gap in the narrative as the story progresses. Maybe through brief flashbacks or through conversations that the character have. Like a flashback-exposition.

As I read through the chapters, there were occasional mysterious allusions to events that seem to have transpired in the story which I had no clue about. I still thought that it will all be explained in the upcoming few chapters and read along.

I trudged on and at some point totally forgot about the missing continuum, because there were so many details in the moment to moment plot, there were many mini plot lines that engaged me.

When I neared the final few pages of the book, there was a sudden lore drop and detailed talks about events that seem to have happened that I absolutely had no clue about. I knew something was wrong. But through sheer momentum I finished the book. Waiting for some grand reveal. Nothing really was revealed.

I flip to the page after the final page and it said something along the lines of ""check out book 4: the shadow rising""

And that's when I realised I accidentally picked up the 3rd book. I skipped the 2nd book.

The beauty of wheel of time (or the sheer atrocity in pacing, as some might say) is that even if you miss an entire book, you can absolutely just guess your way through the story and still have a coherent understanding of the overall narrative and be completely invested in the characters.

Turns out the projectionist messed up a couple reels in the middle of the movie, so a bunch of shit happened out of order. Some of the people in our theater realized it and complained. We were all given coupon booklets with like 5 free movies and popcorn and stuff.

But by that time there was maybe 12 people left from a theater of like 50+ people. I still chuckle to myself when I think about there must be some people from that showing who think mission impossible is the worst movie ever made, and so confused how anyone could have liked it.

I knew the book well enough to think things were weird, but they changed enough of the story either way (like Sheelob not showing up until the third movie) that I still just assumed it was the director messing with the story. Luckily someone else figured out what was going on, so we soon got a sheepish apology, an intermission with free refills of drinks and popcorn, then they went back and played the reels in order. 

The same theatre actually had a reel catch on fire at the midnight release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire a couple years later. From friends who attended, it was right as Harry emerged from the maze, which made for quite a dramatic ending. People quickly realized it wasn’t artistic license with the story and something had gone wrong, but there was no fixing things that night. And since the rest of the showings for the next few days were already sold out people had to wait until the next week to use their free tickets and watch the full film.

Unsurprisingly they found the money to upgrade to digital fairly soon after the latter incident. And it’s a good thing too, they’re one of the last independent, single-screen cinemas anround and I think being forced to modernize is part of the reason why. ","lr73259"

Back then it was administered across five days, days 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 (I think they have since dropped the day 21 dose).  On day 1 you received one dose of rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin based on your weight (I received four shots total that day; immunoglobulin was probably 1 shot for every ~50 pounds of body weight if I had to guess).  Days 4, 7, 14 and 21 were just a single dose of rabies vaccine in the arm.  I don't remember the shots being especially painful; I think Covid is worse.

Lucky for me, day 4 coincided with the day that I got my wisdom teeth out so any vaccine pain that I had on that day was taken out by the pain meds I got for surgery recovery.  That was a really rough week for me!

ETA: Massive silver lining is that I no longer have the faintest ounce of anxiety over getting shots.  Four shots in a day will do that to a person.","lr6drc2"

Doesn't have an english translation yet.

I have no idea how well the ones work that ARE translated, but the challenge is noted in the wiki. Just for instance the island in the book is called ""Eydernorn"", being an obvious anagram of ""Norderney"" And basically every named noun in the books is some sort of that.  

If any of that sounds interesting, I really liked [Rumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumo_and_His_Miraculous_Adventures) best. (Well till this one, but thats for personal reasons :D) But again, read it in German, so mileage may vary. (but looking at the wikientries of some of them....  while a valiant effort, it kind of feels like a fools errant. For instance an animal in one of them is called a Crat (basically a cat but different). In German it Is ""Kratze"" (from Katze), but the closer english would be a Scrat and even THAT isn't catching the Pun between ""scratch"" and ""cat"" being one little r in German.","lr5y11t"

Moers is basically the only German author I actually follow.
