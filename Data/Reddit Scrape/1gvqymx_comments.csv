Augusta Britt would go on to become one of the most significant—and secret—inspirations in literary history, giving life to many of McCarthy’s most iconic characters across his celebrated novels and Hollywood films. For 47 years, Britt closely guarded her identity and her story. Until now.

This is going to cause a lot of re-evaluation of Cormac McCarthy. Although it should be noted that in the place he was (New Mexico) the AoC was and is 16. So not technically illegal.",""
"ly4xqfx","yazminslide","2024-11-20 18:18:20 UTC","Honestly, I'm glad that she was not traumatized by this relationship so with respect to her, I will not call her a victim. However, his actions are predatory. There is a clear power imbalance between him.

Again, ""using her own words"" as some of you in this thread love to say, she says some questionable things about him. One is that when she confronted him about writing about her and how it made her feel, he didn't say he would stop. In fact, his response seems dismissive of her feelings. Her life was used as art for his work, and it clearly really affected her. It seems like she's starting to change her mind about how she was portrayed in his novels, but it's upsetting that someone who loved her wouldn't acknowledge her feelings about the situation. 

Second, he made her ""the other woman"" as one of his ex-wives called her, which is putting her in a very powerless position. Then he apparently asked her to marry her, but got ""cold feet"" twice. Again, he has all the power in this relationship to choose the path it goes down. 

Then, there's this whole passage about him sending his fantasies to a 16 year old girl who feels uncomfortable reading them. First of all, this is a grooming tactic to see what they can get away with by pushing boundaries. But also, it seems to me that his relationship with her was mostly based in fantasy. The ""trip"" to Mexico was an escape from reality. Them coming together in later years is an escape from the everyday. He might have loved the idea of her he had in his head, but couldn't commit to the everyday realities of being with her (re: the marriage proposal). It might be comforting for her to know that she was the love of his life, but even the way his letters are written seem to be based in infatuation with how he sees her. 

Their entire relationship in my opinion is based on how he views her in his novels and letters. Even when she's telling her story, the interviewer still centers McCarthy's perspective of her of this wild muse. Just my opinion, you don't have to like it and can still read his books without thinking critically about them if you want to!

EDIT: Honestly, I'd love to hear more about her relationship with him, specifically the period between the trip to Mexico and feeling uncomfortable about the letters. Also, preferably by a different interviewer. I didn't vibe with this person.",""

Then when she wises up and jets out, she's still attached to him in which he traumatized her further by making her very private life stories public and by killing off fictionalized versions of her.

He seemed like a terrible father until he was much older, he was always broke, he was an alcoholic for years and he was quite obviously a destructive person. That’s not even getting into his three divorces. So I’m not really too surprised he also would get into something like this. 

Yes, this is creepy and strange, but having read the article, I feel like there’s some nuance in here. Both of them met when they were in terrible places and their lives were falling apart. It makes sense to me that a profoundly lonely person like this would find solace in someone who had read their book and talked to them. 

It also seemed like no physically relationship started until she was older, though she was still quite young and it’s supremely creepy/unsettling.

I agree strongly with you. That bothered me. What a traumatized young woman does to survive is her business. But to view her continually and exclusively through the lens of the man who engaged with, again, a *traumatized minor child,* is to deny her individuality and her humanity. She loved him. Perhaps he loved her. But he didn't treat her like someone who was beloved to him. He didn't respect her young age, and even through rose-colored glasses, he didn't solve the problems in her life. He took her away from them for a while and fired up some new problems instead. She obviously left him for reasons. Cycling in and out of each other's life afterward doesn't mean they're star-crossed lovers, destined for one another. It means they're humans who value connection even when it seems nonsensical.

>Honestly, I'd love to hear more about her relationship with him, specifically the period between the trip to Mexico and feeling uncomfortable about the letters. Also, preferably by a different interviewer. I didn't vibe with this person.

Also, no one is calling for McCarthy to be canceled, at least not in this thread. I'm not even sure what that would look like - how do you cancel a dead person? But I'm sure some people will consider this and decide that maybe they don't need to read books by a man who seduced a 16 year old and thought that would be a fun thing to include in his fiction. And that's a perfectly legitimate choice.

How embarrassing would it be for Vanity Fair if, for example, she said she met him at a motel pool, and that motel never had a pool?


Or she told a personal story that she claimed he adapted for a novel, and it turned out she just read the novel and never met him?


Or if she didn't show the journalist any personal letters from him, photographs of them together, signed novels, gifts he gave her, knowledge of his personal life and acquaintances corroborated by those others?


This isn't just some random woman making a tweet saying she was his muse.


I read half the article and didn't see anything like, ""she showed me a letter in his handwriting saying, you are my muse,"" but you can typically trust that journalists check this sort of thing before they write a giant article.

Do you think the journalist put every piece of evidence into thr article, or did they maybe corroborate some other stuff that they didn't dedicate a paragraph to?


It's so weird to me how everyone thinks men are so much more believable than women. Nobody goes, ""Well, what if this man was lying about NOT dating a teenager?"" Women are just automatically suspect in a way that men are not.


It's way easier to think, ""she made it all up for clout,"" than to think, ""An older man wrote spicy letters to a teenager.""


And somehow, her desire to write a book and get famous is suspicious. It's not okay for her to do that - it must mean she's lying and money-hungry and taking advantage of this poor old nice dead man!

I’m agree with you. I’m not sure I feel strongly about this at all especially in light of the year of the year we’ve had with serial rapists (i.e. Diddy)

Copying a comment from another post about this:

Find someone who's the same selfish prick at 40 that they were as an adolescent and that's probably what you're dealing with.

Along with the inherent selfishness and decreased empathy it presents, it also has a myriad of other side-effectgs, including increased and rapid conflation and confabulation of memories, so that they can ""rewrite"" history that undermines their egocentricity.

It's also at the root of narcissism, which is based in an absence of internal confidence leading to the creation of an outward persona that is self-perceived as flawless.

The author of the VF article does reflect on the serendipitous nature of it all so that it doesn't seem, at face value, to be heavily embellished. Yes, McCarthy biographers are probably pining and falling over themselves to get access to this woman, her letters, and her intimate experience with the author. He is, in many ways, a total enigma in terms of influences, motivations, machinations, and writing process.

"lyc30ed","as_it_was_written","2024-11-22 00:18:47 UTC","To me, there are a few clear differences.

First: McCarthy was already dead when this article was published. Nobody is supporting him financially by buying his books. 

Second: people are upset with Rowling for the ways in which she is actively trying to influence public opinion, not just for behaving immoraly in her private life, and her popularity as a writer is why she has a platform in the first place. 

Third: their work is very different, and thus their average readers are also very different. Even if their public personas and moral failings had been indistinguishable, I would have expected different reactions from their audiences. 

Among other things, I think children's/YA fantasy with good guys and bad guys has a much higher percentage of readers who mostly enjoy a book if they get the sense they'd like the author compared to the kind of work McCarthy wrote. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it obviously has downstream effects once the author does something the readers don't like. 

Someone who already has a sense they probably wouldn't like the author as a person is a whole lot less likely to react with surprised outrage in case they do something immoral. I think a lot of Rowling's readers felt betrayed on some level when she turned out to be a shitty person, and I don't think nearly as many McCarthy readers had that type of reaction.

Fourth: we might not only expect authors who write cuddly stories to be decent people, but of course what we know about an author - which largely comes from their work in many cases - affects what we expect from them as people. I doubt anybody who is familiar with McCarthy's body of work is shocked at this revelation, whereas I think Rowling had a relatively wholesome image before she started airing her political views. 

Fifth, finally, and perhaps most importantly: Rowling has an enormous amount of readers compared to McCarthy. The  first Harry Potter book is the fourth-best-selling book of all time at around 120 million copies. I couldn't find up-to-date sales figures on The Road, but it had sold around 1.5 million copies in 2011, 5 years after it was released, 4 years after it was featured on Oprah, and 2 years after the movie adaptation. Part of the huge backlash against Rowling is just how popular her work is.","ly5cpr9"

I prefer to not give bad people money, so if Harry Potter were good books, I wouldn't buy them but I would probably check them out from the library. 


McCarthy is dead so any books of his that I buy don't fill his pockets with money to have statutory sex with. Especially since I mostly buy used books. ","ly5cpr9"

That journalist’s career was over, rolling stone took a massive hit to their reputation and had to pay out millions in lawsuits. 

We found out that the story was crap because OTHER JOURNALISTS thought it was fishy and looked into it themselves. Also, if a journalist fucks up a story their editor’s ass is also on the line. That means for a story to be shit and get published the editor has to be knowingly malicious or have fucked up. Either way, multiple people can get fucked if a story is poorly done and thus highly inaccurate or incorrect for malicious reasons. Again, that journalist’s career was 100% over after this.

She went home and looked at the book she was reading - an old paperback she bought for 10¢ of McCarthy’s out-of-print book the Orchard Keeper - and recognized the picture of the author on the back cover as the man at the motel pool. She said she then walked up to him at the pool with the book in one hand while wearing a colt revolver in a holster. He asked her if she was going to shoot him. She said no, she wanted him to sign the book for her and he was impressed that a pretty 16 year old girl was reading his out-of-print book.

It’s a ridiculous story and was quickly proved that the 1969 paperback of The Orchard Keeper did not have a photo of McCarthy anywhere in or on the book.  So who knows what’s true and what isn’t. So much of this article is hard to believe …. and hard to read because of the purple prose. The writer is obviously so enthralled by McCarthy and by Augusta Britt that he literally doesn’t sound as if he is in his right mind. It reads like a fever dream.

Do we really think a 16 year old traumatized runaway from a foster home (which she describes more like a group home) was showering at a motel, reading Faulkner in a closet and had a stuffed kitten named John Grady Cole? I mean….come on.

Whereas, someone like Cormac McCarthy putting questionable relationships into his narratives, or Michael Jackson using his fame as leverage to appeal to young people (allegedly…) suggests a more direct link between the art and the artist so boycotting the art is valid.

It’s difficult because you don’t *choose* to enjoy art.

I think you are incorrectly casting the person you are responding to as dismissive. 

I met a women when we were both in our 30s. She described going to a concert and sleeping with her dream crush, who was in their late 20s, when she was 15. She described it as the best night of her life. I thought it was creepy and gross. But that was a thing that happened in her life not some theoretical moral action that I could freely ascribe my opinions to. She didn't have a negative word to say about the experience or the person she had it with. I would be dismissive of her if I told her it that what happened on the ""best night of her life"" was actually traumatic and abusive. It isn't clear to me that she was ""see[ing] past trauma"" so much as not viewing this experience as traumatic in any way.

I cannot find anything in this article where the subject describes her relationship with McCarthy as anything besides positive, at least before he started using her, as an adult, as close inspiration for characters in his stories. In fact, the article quotes her explicitly saying something else:

""When I ask Britt how she feels about the parental-age gap between them, if the relationship felt in any way like grooming, she acknowledges the age difference will probably come as a shock to many readers, but she never felt that there was anything inappropriate about their relationship. In fact, part of her 47-year reluctance to tell her story is a fear that her relationship with McCarthy, the most important in her life, will be misunderstood by the wider public.

I just wanna raise a point on this specific point here...

Buying HP shit puts money directly into Rowling's pockets, which she then uses to fund anti-trans shit. There is a direct throughline from buying stuff to supporting anti-trans things by proxy. Now, there's a lot of this in other industries with... virtually everything (we live in a society and all of that) but given this, it's also valid for trans people to be upset with their ""friends"" and ""allies"" for buying anything that gives Rowling money. They aren't ridiculous or something for being upset at that. 

I would assume if you somehow had a sweatshop worker as a friend, they'd also be justifiably upset at their ""friend's"" SHIEN hauls. We're able to distance ourselves from the harm caused by things like SHIEN because Americans and Europeans are generally sheltered from the people harmed. Not the case with LGBTQ people (generally).

In addition to this, there's genuine racist stereotypes in Harry Potter that are clearly influenced from Rowling's own opinions. Goblins and Jewish stereotypes, POC character names, the list goes on.

I'll admit that the only work I've read of his is the Road, which was certainly memorably haunting. I guess it has a message of hopefulness and 'life finds a way', which is uplifting, if not particularly unique. What I've heard about his other books from reading about them and watching movies based on them is that they're startling in their relentless violence. But what, exactly, is the message there? That life is meaningless and violence is inevitable? Is that valuable? It's certainly not new. 

> But we’re a culture lacking on serious art that cuts through the noise of people’s day to day lives.

Is that true? Are we a culture that lacks serious art, or just a culture that fails to celebrate serious art? To be frank, in the case of Cormac McCarthy, I think the art being celebrated is something with acceptable writing that people think is profound because it's disturbing and they mistake that for depth. I think we still have a bias that that manly shit is the most important, and what's more manly than violence?

But there was - especially around the border trilogy's release - a certain persona of the recluse outdoorsman who'd spend months traveling the wilderness and wrote dark and violent stories about tough and manly men's men - which is an image selectively omitting the part where he was lying in bed for weeks at a time reading old poetry or moping for years about how his first wife left him 'cause he wouldn't get a job. (And the fact he seemingly never fired a gun or rode a horse is the icing on top.) His supposed taciturnity is very much part of that image, too - he didn't like giving interviews, but I've read numerous accounts of people chatting him up while he was hanging out in bars and coffee shops - which he often did - and finding him a perfectly affable individual who could talk for hours about anything -- so long as the topic of discussion wasn't his own work.","ly5imfg"

There’s multiple species of media illiterate people. There’s the conspiracy minded “don’t trust experts or mainstream sources, but do believe a whole lot of insane bullshit”, and there’s the general lazy cynicism of “the media lies to us all the time man, you can’t trust anything” but then they just lazily believe whatever they wanted to believe in the first place, and a whole lot of people that only get loud and weird around specific topics (ones that apply to their interests or their personal identity).

The reason why stories about men’s sexual misconduct inspire the most widespread histrionics is because the biggest demographic block that has a systematic and unjust advantage in society are men (half of the global population if you’d believe that). I guess you could call patriarchy the single most widespread cultural system. 

For sex, the taboo nature of it and the complex rules and norms that guide how we think about and do it makes it a particularly thorny subject for both sides (defenders of patriarchy who are wrong and critics of patriarchy who are right).","ly4f4s2"

I think LM's problem was that she wasn't willing to accept script changes once she had memorized everything, because it would require her to re-memorize new lines.

But normal actors need to be able to adapt to script changes and to modify their performance accordingly.

It's ""improv"" in the sense that a new/modified performance needs to be improvised instead of a memorized one.

But I really think that lumping in older teens with prepubescent children infantilizes teens too much and I also feel that actual pedophilia is way, way worse than McCarthy's behaviour. This doesn't make McCarthy's behaviour fine, because the power differential is still immense and the potential for coercion and manipulation are way too great to condone this type of stuff. And of course, it's illegal in most places. But I don't like using an actual psychology term in a way that isn't accurate.

Another thing is people equating pedophilia and child rape. They are NOT the same thing. Pedophilia just means the attraction, it does not mean child rape. Someone can be a pedophilic without ever abusing a child and someone can even be a child rapist without having pedophilia (rather rare, but it's not actually an oxymoron). I just want people to use the proper terms and I feel that misusing terminology like this makes discussion about these topics more difficult. Rape, sexual abuse or even merely problematic/dangerous sexual or romantic behaviour are very complex and important topics that need to be discussed with care and precision.

My problem now is that the brigade of commentors seem to think that their distinction is somehow intrinsic to the terms. But this is a perceived intention issue that is being wrongly applied to term usage in general. 'females' being dehumanizing is a contextual issue, embedded in society. Would it be dehumanizing for a person from a country where it is typical to use the term 'female' as a noun, if it is not typically understood as dehumanizing there? Obviously not.

Ten year olds aren't even able to be prosecuted in my country while 16 year olds definitely can be. Pedophilia means just the attraction to prepubescent children and the vast majority of 16 year olds aren't prepubescent. Using the term pedophilia for that waters it down in my opinion. And keep in mind that the age of consent is lower than 18 in many European countries and even many US states. In my country 16 year olds can sleep with adults, if the adults don't take advantage of them being in a terrible situation (like financially for example). So it's not even statutory rape in many jurisdictions. 16 year olds don't even count as children legally in my country. They are called adolescents and are allowed to vote and drink (not hard liquor though).

All of that being said, this doesn't make McCarthy's relationship with a 16 year old fan fine in any way. The power imbalance is immense and the opportunity for coercion and exploitation is way too big.

Your comment shows the intellectual bankruptcy of what you are doing. First, right after I made the initial post using females, I had a nice conversation with other people about why 'female' was not the preferred term. I accepted it, and even said I was going to reevaluate my use of the term 'female' in this context. I used female as a general catch all that did not denote age. That fact that you think there is an 'L' for me to take shows how intellectually bankrupt you are. This is about you winning some illusionary competition, and winning brownie points for your neighborhood watch. 

Your comments on boy/men and girl/woman term usage also show your intellectual bankruptcy. Do you not see the way that the term 'girls' functions to reinforce the patriarchical structures of society? To be a 'girl' is not some intrinsic property of certain groups of people, it's a term used by society to describe a group of people, and that term comes along with all sorts of negative connotation about what this child is, and what they are capable of doing and contributing to society, as well as what you can expect out of them i.e. 'you throw like a girl' 'im just a girl' 'wow that's good for a girl' . It connotes within our society weakness, lack of autonomy, inferiority.... And for some reason that is an accepted term to describe someone even though it has functioned as a way to minimize women for very long time? And that's just its relationship to women... It's not even looking at the way it functions in relation to girls themselves or teens. 

Whether there is a difference between two sets of societal constructs is besides the point. But the same can be said about the term 'boys' and it's historical significance within society. 

You need to define the exact differences you are talking about between 'women' and 'girls' (as a stand in for teenager) and examine whether it functions in exactly the same way that everyone is saying 'female' for 'women' functions. 

This whole brigade wants to talk about this stuff as though these words have intrinsic meaning and I'm woefully wrong.... But you guys don't seem to given any deep thought to any of this at all. You're all just lashing out and looking to win.

"ly50eqh","Roh33zy","2024-11-20 18:31:50 UTC","Where did you get that? I don’t care about Cormac or who he actually is, but as a creative you are understood through your works. Which is what I’m doing with him. It’s not any different from what an average person who perceives art does. Is the mick jagger you see on stage the same one you hear in the songs, or that you’d run into on the street. No, they are three distinct iterations of the individual because they are perceived and understood differently in those contexts. 

Sure it’s easy to say that I am “assigning intent” but I’m not. I’m simply explaining my subjective understanding of the book in an online forum. Part of the reason why this is my opinion is that It’s clearly stated by Cormac in a NYT interview that he deals pretty explicitly with moral ambiguity and the violence and nihilism associated therein. 

Besides. What else is art for but to amplify the human experience, a fundamental component of which is the yearning to understand- and a fundamental extension of which is to seek to assign meaning to things? Sure I know that there are things that are not meant to be understood but the media of novels are inherently antithetical to that, they’re written down so that they CAN be understood more clearly or clearer conclusions and resolutions  can be drawn from the work","ly4yfri"
"ly46dz2","Roh33zy","2024-11-20 15:58:25 UTC","1) again, this conversation started about cormac mccarthy, and the statement which necessatiatied your response was about if people think the author of books like blood meridian or no country for old men was a truly good person. You’re over here arguing about people recognizing that in themselves/in the world. Buddy, that’s what I was talking about too, just in a very specific context. Obviously perception does not align with reality but if that’s the case then nothing is objectively “implicit” about goodness or any state of being for that matter. However, in this specific context given the vast body of work that deals quite directly with moral ambiguity, one can say that there is no concept of “goodness” on cormac perception of the world and as such anyone who considers him to be “good” has fundamentally misunderstood his point of view
2) again, agreed that it isn’t always but I was referring to the specific context in which you brought up the concept of the bedtime story notion. I’m well aware there are many themes in bedtime stories. I was a kid too once lol. Sure it may have a valence in “our present context” whatever that may mean but within the context of the world mccarthys works embody there is no such concept of “goodness”. As such, anyone who reads any of his works and comes to the conclusion that he has portrayed anything in his world as coming from a place of “goodness” or due to someone being a “good person” has not understood his works. By extension, from this worldview we can surmise that McCarthy would not have viewed himself as an objectively good person let alone believed that such a type of person existed","ly445jw"

Says who? I disagree with this so profoundly that I'm not sure we'll ever see eye-to-eye on anything lol. And I'm not trying to change your opinion on McCarthy. ""**I** didn't find any meaning in this. The violence/unpleasantness seemed **to me** to be covering up for a lack of substance,"" is a perfectly valid thing to feel. What I take issue with is you saying, ""People who have found meaning in McCarthy's work are confusing violence for depth."" I don't like you superimposing your subjective experience/reaction onto someone else. Who are you to tell someone that something that found meaningful isn't actually meaningful?","lybainx"

Ahh so you composed this opinion not because you gleaned it from diluted creative works like some kind of osmotic wisdom, but because he literally just told you straight up.","ly50eqh"

That's a valid point. I think the fundamental disconnect between us is that I don't think violence on its own is particularly interesting or meaningful, and you do, and you resent the wording about people mistaking violence for depth. 

I guess I had hoped that maybe there is something else going on with McCarthy besides just 'life is meaningless and violence is inevitable', but maybe that is what people find meaningful about the work.","lybg48h"
