Mitch and Yonko haven’t spoken in a year. As children, they were inseparable, raised together in an orphanage outside Tokyo—but ever since the sudden death of Mitch’s brother, they’ve been mourning in their private ways, worlds apart. In the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe, they choose to reunite, finding each other in a city undone by disaster.

Mitch and Yonko have drifted apart, but they will always be bound together. Because long ago they witnessed an unspeakable tragedy, a tragedy that they’ve kept secret for their entire lives. They never speak of it, but it’s all around them. Like history, it repeats itself.

Yuko Tsushima’s sweeping and consuming final novel is a metaphysical saga of postwar Japan. *Wildcat Dome* is a hugely ambitious exploration of denial, of the ways in which countries and their citizens avoid telling the truth—a tale of guilt, loss, and inevitable reckoning.",""

Onyx Storm: I loved Fourth Wing, but was a little let down by Iron Flame; I think because it was written so quickly, the quality suffered. It’s been quite a while though so I’m hoping Yarros will pull the story back together a little bit.


Sunrise on the Reaping: The Hunger Games has always been one of my favorite series, and I’m so excited to see more about the world prior to Katniss’s games. 


Everything is Tuberculosis by John Green: His last book was also nonfiction and it was quite good, and I’m looking forward to reading both about the history of TB and the work he’s been doing with PiH to help those who need it.


Poets Square: A Memoir in Thirty Cats by Courtney Gustafson:
This one is by a tiktoker that I follow who bought a house that came with a colony of cats, and now she does a lot of work to TNR cats in her community and rehabilitate the ones that need it.


A Ballad of Falling Dragons by Sarah A. Parker:
This is the sequel to When the Moon Hatched, and it’s coming out in October 2025. I found the world of the first book really fascinating and it’s another romantasy much like Fourth Wing, except with less war-school.",""

"lwekge1","arglebargle_IV","2024-11-10 12:56:20 UTC","""End of 2024"" is the only thing I see when I search.

In [this paywalled NY Times interview with Rupert Holmes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/books/review/rupert-holmes-cant-read-while-music-is-playing.html), one of the questions asked of him was ""What do you plan to read next?""  The reply was ""The final chapters, as I type them, of ""Murder Your Mate,"" volume 2 of The McMasters Guide to Homicide."" 

This was on 2/23/23, so more than a year and a half ago.","lwdxdlf"

"lwdsoo6","YeeHaw_Mane","2024-11-10 08:08:32 UTC","Yeah, I still finished it and remember that from the preface. A lot of the action just didn’t hit quite the same. And similar to how LOTR gets teased for being 90% walking around, I felt like this book was mostly just riding trains around without too much going on, lol. I’ll continue on to 4, though…. Cheers!","lwds4ll"

Looking forward to seeing how it all plays out. Superb trilogy.","lwd3t23"

"lwf7a41","Lauchli","2024-11-10 15:25:18 UTC","Wait, I always thought Murakami writes in English (and translates his work back to Japanese)? Why would they need translation for a book originally written in English? I am confused.
Anyway, Murakami is one of my favourites!","lwc15mu"
"lwdreu1","Regula96","2024-11-10 07:54:55 UTC","One can hope! But book 1 was finished in June and then released in May the following year. I doubt this one can manage the same date..","lwdr2yq"
"lwgltl8","turquoise_mutant","2024-11-10 19:43:41 UTC","No, they are written in Japanese and translated, and not by him. Perhaps you confused him with Kazuo Ishiguro?","lwf7a41"

"lwji5ni","Lauchli","2024-11-11 06:00:51 UTC","Thanks. I don't know Ishiguro and I could not find my original source from years ago, but this article about Murakami says he does write in English and translates back: [Source](https://www.gale.com/intl/databases-explored/literature/haruki-murakami#:~:text=Dissatisfied%20with%20his%20initial%20attempts,and%20startling%20juxtapositions%20of%20images.)
Since I need to go to work I don't have time to search for the original source or a better one. Anyway, somehow I had that fact (?) in the back of my mind. 
Haha a great day!","lwgltl8"
