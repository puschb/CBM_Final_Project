"lwe3iny","ARBlackshaw","2024-11-10 10:08:47 UTC","I posted this on another thread, but I want to to give context to non-Australians who might not know why this is so incredibly offensive:

>but involves a subplot where a wicked woman with supernatural powers teleports herself to Alice Springs to steal a child from a fictitiously named community called Borolama.

>She wants an Australian Indigenous child to join her press gang of kidnapped children who work her land because “First Nations children seem to be more connected with nature”.

[article with the plot summary](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/09/jamie-oliver-apologises-after-childrens-book-criticised-for-stereotyping-first-nations-australians-ntwnfb)

If you haven't heard of the Stolen Generation, the short of it is that the Australian government forcibly removed many First Nations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders) children from their families from 1905 to 1967 (or even later in some areas). Between 1 in 3 and 1 in 10 First Nations children were taken from their families 


It is a terrible mark on our history and not something to just slap into a fantasy novel. Especially considering how recent it was.


As someone who is not First Nations, I personally wouldn't even consider writing a fantasy novel with a plot/subplot on such a topic, let alone do it without proper consultation/sensitivity readers.

Highlights management pointed it out, and I’m grateful they did because it opened my eyes to how even well-meaning design can carry unintended messages. I realized that for children especially, these images can subtly shape how they view others—and I didn’t want my work to reinforce any negative or narrow ideas. Since then, I’ve worked to ensure my designs are thoughtful and genuinely inclusive.

What’s surprising is that when I talk about this shift, some people instantly dismiss the concern over stereotyping as just ‘political correctness.’ It’s often a right-wing view to downplay these things, but for me, it’s about more than dumb politics—it’s about respecting children’s minds and giving them puzzles and toys that celebrate diversity in an authentic, open-minded way.",""

From my perspective, it is totally understandable for First Nations people to be upset that someone fantasy-fied a real and recent tragedy they suffered (and are still suffering the effects of), especially when no First Nations people were consulted.


[This article](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/09/jamie-oliver-apologises-after-childrens-book-criticised-for-stereotyping-first-nations-australians-ntwnfb) on the whole debacle has some insightful and informative comments on the matter by various First Nations people who are in the writing and publishing industry.


>Should a fantasy novel never involve other touchy subjects, such as slavery just because it is a sensitive topic?

This happens for a few reasons.

* They pick someone with less power than them who really doesn't have the authority to push back without consequences, often a junior to them who fears for their job
* They pick someone who is a friend who doesn't want to push back for fear of ruining the friendship
* They hire a consultant and ignore their perspective

Now in Jamie Oliver's case, it sounds like he didn't try anything. But I've seen people push the 'hey, we need diverse perspectives' narrative enough that people are listening, just not in any way that effects change.

There’s also the very real problem of white celebrity voices drowning out PoC authors’ voices. People are drawn to the celebrity names thinking that because they’ve heard of them it speaks to the quality of the book, and that means there are plenty of better writers left on the shelves.

It is hard enough to get a book deal off the ground for a white author, but PoC authors writing about PoC characters have an even steeper mountain to climb. If the (publishing opinion) niche interest has been filled by the celebrity book and especially if it’s not sold amazingly well, they are less likely to take a chance on Indigenous authors writing their own magical realism stories about Indigenous characters that have a stronger basis in lived experience and intimate knowledge of myth and storytelling.

Debatable - depends on how you define ""real chef"". While it might be natural to assume like most UK TV chefs that he achieved great culinary success and his fame derived from that, he's actually kind of the odd one out. His experience in kitchens before he became famous was very limited. 

He started doing TV work at 22, has only a few years of actual kitchen experience, and the highest position he ever held was sous chef. He is, in the most literal sense (i.e. having been a chef de cuisine or executive chef), not a chef. Any one of those cooks likely had more practical kitchen experience than him. 

Note also, that the restaurant business he started using the money he got from his TV work was a very public and catastrophic failure that went massively into debt.

If you're self-publishing, sure. But if you're using a publishing house (which is the usual route), then they are investing a lot of time and money into your book - it's an investment for them. No publisher wants to spend resources editing and marketing a book only for it to be a flop/be badly received because of racist stereotypes! Same for the editor and every other person in the publishing pipeline working with the author/working on the book.

Sensitivity readers are becoming much more commonplace in the publishing process.

In the case of Jamie Oliver's book, the publisher is Penguin Random House UK (PRH UK), and not only have they apologised, but [they have admitted](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/09/jamie-oliver-apologises-after-childrens-book-criticised-for-stereotyping-first-nations-australians-ntwnfb) that ""no consultation with any Indigenous organisation, community or individual took place before the book was published"" - which is extremely embarrassing for them.

1. You like the above have not said HOW it is misapplied.

2. You have not refuted the above 2 comments who were contradicted then tangled themselves in knots pretending they had not been despite being so.

In point of fact all that has been reported is:

\\* Sensitive subject in history as form of plot in children’s book has been given a political verdict of insensitive

\\* Supporting argument that in addition to the former the trope of Magical Native is used which “Must Be Bad”

I have clearly pointed out that the trope is not inherently bad ie a loaded label, it entirely depends on the quality of Usage. It is not a supporting argument ALONE without a correct critique of the reference in the story.

As such a lot of comments here are merely “hatchet-job”, castigating and not constructive, for example, I would start with the assumption of “Innocence and Good Intentions” as starting point in Jamie Oliver:

1. Did he deliberately intend to write a story that would be blocked and hurt the feelings of related people to the story?

2. Where does the origin of selecting the specific plot of “stolen generation“ in his mind come from given it seems obvious it is a sensitive and raw issue? An odd choice but what storys was he trying to convey?

3. Tropes are perfectly applicable irrespective of any given group identity, however, the quality of their usage will range from opposite positions eg negative or positive. Using labels alone as argument is censorious and anti freedom of ideas and competition of those ideas in a market place of different ideas people perceive in the themselves and the world around them and the best defence of true democracy practiced actively in all walks of life eg book reviews.","lwe9dfx"

Consequences are based on the impact of your actions, not your intentions. Good intentions are not a shield against criticism. And I don't think Jamie Oliver's intentions were anything other than self-serving.

However do you have more specific example of the description used in the book? Without such, it still seems within scope for an aboriginal of any description including child to make a personal assertion eg (note I am making this up for illustration) “We, Abos, we keep our ear close to mother earth who whispers her secrets to us, telling us secrets others cannot ordinarily know.”

I mean that would be a case of making a sweeping statement but equally that is just one character making such a statement in any number of contexts within a story or real world and it is to be taken as such and for the reader to make their own discernment. Without meaning to labour the issue, it is important to KNOW the precise usage as I have stated is necessary…

\\>\\*”You are talking about over-intellectualization but I believe one does the same when they ignore the practical effects of narratives”\\*

Yes, I agree, the politics situation has an influence, I have not argued against that here. I have suggested it seems wrong to condemn and castigate Oliver because it would seem the last thing he wanted to achieve, but at the same time seems an odd choice of plot and theme for his book and again there is no relevant info in the news about why he chose this plot and what he really intended…

It certainly doesn’t diminish the discrimination though, as Marcia Langton said “We were not classified under the ‘flora and fauna act’ but we were treated as animals.”

I’ve included a link to a breakdown that I was using since I feel it’s important to be accurate when discussing issues. Enough horrible things have been done to indigenous communities that recounting false stories only undermines the cause and minimizes the actual terrible things that were done.

Nope, the goalposts were set from my first post, the appropriation is in using another culture to sell your product while not respecting that culture enough to follow the actual recipe.

No I'm saying if you buy anything labelled as X should be X. The ""authentic"" label only exists because people like Jamie Oliver exist who sells you a phony bill of goods.
