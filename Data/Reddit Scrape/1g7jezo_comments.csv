"lsr1vcg","MaichenM","2024-10-19 22:02:01 UTC","Most of the books you're talking about are self-published, and it's possible that an editor was not even hired. People with platforms like Tiktok or Podcasts would prefer to self-publish because they get to keep a higher portion of the money, and they can funnel their fans to the book, meaning that the promotional aspects of trad-pub would not appeal to them as much.

Even if it is tradpubbed, like Gothikana, money has always been king in publishing, and publishers will be smart to consider their target audience. For example: if you are reading a book *because* it was written by the author of My Immortal, you definitely *are not* looking for polished, tightly edited prose. If you are, well, you put that clown makeup on yourself. Don't blame others for it.

But if I can be even more blunt: good, talented novelists who are capable of self-editing and working well with a team of editors are known first and foremost for their novels. Don't get me wrong, it's possible for a plumber to know how to build a car. It's possible for an electrician to be a great chef. It's certainly possible for a person who creates and edits engaging six second video clips to know how to write a novel.

But I'm going to buy a book by a person who made their bones as a *novelist,* every time.",""

There's so many publishers and such a glut of books available that you can avoid the big five and hundreds and hundreds of others, if you choose, and never run out of stuff to read.

"lsriytm","sc_merrell","2024-10-19 23:48:09 UTC","Hi there. I'm a freelance editor of self-published books and, basically, any text I can get my hands on.

Editors like me are expensive. A prospective client recently reached out asking about developmental (structural, pacing, character) edits for a 60,000 word manuscript. (Young adult, so lower word counts are more tolerable than in adult fiction, where 80-120k is an almost universal standard.)

Here's what my pricing is for a manuscript of that length. Keep in mind that, for my pricing, the more expensive tiers include all cheaper services--i.e. developmental editing also includes the first three:

* **Proofreading:** $0.015/word; 60,000 words = **$900.00** 
* **Copy Editing:** $0.020/word; 60,000 words = **$1,200.00** 
* **Line Editing:** $0.025/word; 60,000 words = **$1,500.00** 
* **Developmental Editing:** $0.045/word; 60,000 words = **$2,700.00**

If the name of your game is to pump out as much written content as possible in order to a) satisfy the demands of an algorithm so your books rise to the top of Amazon's recommended lists, and b) to market your books as aggressively as possible, then hiring an editor is a huge sink of both time and potential profits. Editing takes time to turn around an effective product, especially if your initial unedited draft is (as you've noticed) not very good.

So most self-published authors these days tend not to hire editors.

I will note that when I attempted to tell the r/writing community about [common pitfalls in self-published work](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18636b0/selfpublished_authors_your_dialogue_formatting/) last year, many of them were not very receptive. ""Readers don't care about quality any longer! You don't have to put in all of this work!""

Unfortunately I missed a number of them when I proofread because I was looking more for the known issues than the new issues and put out a book that I'm embarrassed by.

The biggest concern related to your post is the democratization of publishing tools. The short version is more writers have access to launch their books than ever before, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that they fully understand the process, how many rounds of editing it takes to produce something up to what is accepted as minimum publishing, standard, or how much it cost to work with a quality editor.

Most indie authors today do not trust editors and cannot afford the extra expense. The most many of these authors might put out is $500 for one round of edits. Without seeing any way of getting an ROI, most could not justify spending more than that. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not blaming them. Editing is expensive work. For developmental edit alone you might shall out anywhere from $1000-$2000 or more depending on the length of your book and the quality of your manuscript. Then you still have the line edit and copy edit and maybe proofread. By the end of it, you can easily invest $4000-$6000 just edits. Next to nobody is doing that.

If an author hires, an editor at all, it is usually a copy editor or someone to do a final polish. There are also several authors who simply don‚Äôt trust beta readers for fear of having their work stolen. That‚Äôs a valid concern these days. But all of this equates to new authors publishing without any meaningful feedback or comprehensive revision process‚Ä¶ 

Of course, when someone like me, an editor and writing coach, says these things and tries to offer advice, it tends to sound like gatekeeping, elitism, or a push for authors to hire us. We‚Äôre really just trying to help them avoid the stigma of the self published book‚Äî which, judging by this thread, has been well earned‚Ä¶",""

Kindle Vella falls into that category as well. It's a growing demographic of uncritical consumption, and while most people still have standards that prevent them from wading through that dross, it's still sizeable.

If selfpub authors want to reach that target, they don't need an editor. And, as mentioned, getting an editor will slow them down--and the biggest names in that field are way too fast to slow down. I don't know any specifically, but I've heard of selfpub authors who put out 20+ books in a year, and they have readers who gobble all of them up. 

At that point, you have generated your own kind of success, and I can't even blame you.

I get the feeling that you might not appreciate the level of effort that usually goes into professional media. The phenomenon of executives and marketing data analysts over-engineering media and disregarding writers is relatively new; it used to be much more collaborative.

Anything you see put out by a studio, firm, or even small publisher (usually) goes through enormous levels of iterative effort to ensure its quality. Things don‚Äôt just get ‚Äúrushed out‚Äù by publishers. They get put through the gauntlet of intense critique and feedback.

That‚Äôs because, for professional-level work, thousands, if not millions or (in the case of big media) billions are on the line. The degree of scrutiny that warrants is staggering.¬†

The problem with some content creators is that they don't get paid if they don't create content. They need to either be buying or receiving books, talking about TBRs, doing book reviews, making lists of ""fall books, spooky romance, dark academia"" which is basically the same books over and over again. And they always seem.to have time to do 24hr readathons, or they go live whist reading (which seems so weird to me). If they say they've read a lot they have more content to put out and people think the must know what they're talking about.  I've looked at people's read lists when they've read 300 books in a year and they usually YA, middle grade books, romance/romantasy, very easy to read books. And I'm not suggesting that adults can't read and enjoy books aimed at a younger audience but I do think some creators reading them *because* they're quick and easy, not because they actually enjoy it or are thinking about some of the deeper meanings or the intended audience. 

There are some creators on tiktok who make really interesting and thought provoking tiktoks about books from a wider genre base and they do actual analysis of the text. But they tend to be longer videos about more serious books, so they don't get pushed out by the algorithm as much.","lssuwo5"

The gamble of the publisher was to see if they could market in such a way to get Terry Pratchett or whoever a name and a following. Of course they'd rather take an established name, but such talent is closely guarded. 

So it made sense to 'invest"" in a no name on the off chance they'd be the next Tolkien. Today LOTR or the Hobbit might not be published, unless JR had a podcast.

It's a bit like no one giving seed funding or IPO to startups because there's safer bets with the same payout. No one said it doesn't make financial sense from the pov of publishers. It makes all too much sense.
