(And you can pay a bit to print more than that, should you need to.) The parents are very customizable, too.

Like many people, I print less and less these days - a good change in our lifestyles, for sure. But sometimes you still need to print out a form or whatever.

My library system covers 3 counties because we are rural. Sometimes it takes 6-8 days for items ""in transit"" to arrive when items are out on hold. So imagine the resources it makes available to people that otherwise literally can't access.




We have a garden vegetable and flower seed library, cake pans, musical instruments, one-day access state park passes, zoo and puppet show and museum passes, there's a 3d printer, board games, ""book club bags"" with everything you need for a group of 5-10 to read and discuss, puzzles, a sewing machine, a radon home testing kit, and all manner of math and ELA learning kits for kids and adults. In addition to over 50k books, 3k music CDs and 2k DVDs.





All the parking lots have very strong Wi-Fi so people who need it for digital learning or work or anything can come to the closest library and access Internet 24 hours a day.




My specific library has an adorable fireplace surrounded by couches and arm chairs and an outdoor covered patio




It's one of my favorite places in the world",""

"lt9mm61","confirmSuspicions","2024-10-23 00:49:13 UTC","It's much more than the dollar amount you're attributing to it and let me expand on why I believe that is. You see, when you're using the services of a library, you might be able to afford the books you're interested in. But it will also get you interested in things you wouldn't have given a second thought to. People that have no means of attaining these books, even for a few hours, are now given the same 'social wealth' as everyone else making under 100k per year. Libraries level the playing field.

Furthermore, the intrinsic value of a library is much more than the value given to each person that visits because of it being a shared public space that is unlikely to be obsoleted (like arcades, roller rinks and bowling alleys). Sure, card catalogues and older material will make its way to the garbage bins, given enough time. But that intrinsic value of being a third place where you are allowed to exist with no expectation of spending money is invaluable to the people that need it.

I will admit, I feel a bit like when I was young, I had an infinite amount of time to read and as I grow older, I keep opting for the convenient option. Buying a kindle, but never using it. Buying books I never gave a second glance to. I love the idea of buying and reading new books. What I lack in my life is follow-through. I like the idea of someone like me being allowed to nurture that side of themself that I've lost over the years. I'm hoping that I'll get it back someday. It would be easy to pretend that I will, but what I need is follow-through. When I have the follow-through part figured out, I might just take a trip to my local library. And I'll be glad that it's still there. However updated, outdated, deteriorated, gentrified it is, it's a great place.",""

The main problems really are that copyright is kind of outdated and that people (both creators/ rightsholders and consumers) act really entitled and are often uneducated. Most people don't understand how Fair Use works for example and that's it a US-only thing or that trademark and copyright law are two very different things. Copyright infringement is rampant (and so is copyright abuse). Just look at Reddit: Many pictures (like of celebrities) get posted without paying the photographer, because people don't realise that this falls under publishing and is illegal without paying the photographer.

I live in a 3rd world country. Our libraries are such a far cry from American ones. In fact, we need a sort of pass from the City Hall to be able to access our City Library, and though the library is close to the public elementary school and highschool, not a lot of students decide to go to the library due to the hassle of obtaining the pass, as well as the fact that the City Hall (and the library) is only open at the weekdays on working hours. Parents aren't going to skip a day of work just to get a library pass. Even if we decide to use the Library, it does not have a lot of books. Which is why dedicated readers in the lower socioeconomic income bracket, those who are aware of other great books, as well as university and college students, who are even encouraged by their professors to do so, tend to pirate books‚Äî this is the controversial thing I am going to say, and though I am not endorsing it, I'm scared of the fact that speaking about it will get this comment deleted, when all I want to share is perspective. Our Library also does not have a Libby, or any of those online services things. Maybe there is such a service in the University Libraries, but you must be a student there. Even though University Libraries have a better selection of books (particularly in non-fiction), those that are open to the public tend to have an entrance fee, which I think is 150-200 pesos? That's 3x-4x the daily allowance of a middle class student in elementary, and the daily allowance of a middle class highschool student is within that range, but rarely above it. Libraries aren't also as well-funded as in the Western World‚Äî though our City Library has CDs and computers (if they still work), we lack comfort rooms inside it. Having an actual 3d printer or a coffee machine in a library is almost unthinkable.","lt81ncv"

I love being able to read every single book that interests me. My innate speed is pretty fast, and I read all different types/lengths of books - there's not a lot of consistency. 

What I read changes a lot year-by-year. In 2021 I was mostly into YA fantasy and mysteries. This year I'm focusing mainly on classics.

I typically read about 4-6 hours a day, though individual day variation can be huge - if I'm on a camping/hiking trip it could be less than an hour, if I'm on a flight to Asia it could be 12+ hours.

I don't think it changed me, other than being a lot more knowledgeable about various topics from my nonfiction challenges (I like 50 of the 365 to be nonfiction, ideally science/naturey). I was always a big reader, so it wasn't like going from 0-365 overnight.","ltasgzv"

Per Wikipedia, the suit was about more than that and had two components:

>The Open Library CDL system ensured that only one digital copy is in use for each print copy or otherwise authorized ebook copy available.

>However, on March 24, 2020, following shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internet Archive opened the National Emergency Library, removing the waitlists used in Open Library and expanding access to these books for all readers. More than one user could borrow a book at the same time.[4][5] Two months later, on June 1, the National Emergency Library (NEL) was met with a lawsuit from four book publishers. Two weeks after that, on June 16, the Internet Archive closed the NEL,[6] and the prior Open Library CDL system resumed after the 12 weeks of NEL usage.

>On June 1, 2020, Hachette Book Group and other publishers, including Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, and Wiley, filed a lawsuit against the Internet Archive for the National Emergency Library.[7][8] **The plaintiffs argued that the practice of CDL was illegal and not protected by the doctrine of fair use.[9] **Furthermore, they argued that the Internet Archive was not abiding by CDL, as it had acknowledged that its partner libraries were not always withdrawing their physical copies from their shelves.

My understanding is that the suit did not just challenge the Internet Archive's removal of restrictions on the digital loaning of copies, but was challenging the legality of CDL itself. If you have a source indicating otherwise, I'd be happy to see it.","lt9k6jn"

Consider what President Obama did with NASA. He didn't eliminate the program, but he vastly cut their funding and limited the scope of what they could do. There was still a demand for space studying and exploration, so the field went largely privatized. Not only did it actually create jobs, it bumped the efficiency of the field to the point that greater leaps in space travel have been made in the past decade than in the previous four decades. 

  
If federal funding were cut or eliminated, there would still be a demand for the services they provide. Museums, in particular, are more than just places to hold cool things for people to look at. They're institutions of study and discovery. There is a ton of money to be made by privatizing them. The same holds true with libraries. Eliminate federal funding and they don't disappear, they become for-profit private ventures. Exactly what that looks like, I don't know. That's probably best left to someone with a more entrepreneurial vision than I have. All I can say is that this is what tends to happen when federal funding is cut to various programs. 

  
It's happened in music and arts programs losing funding. Schools lose funding, so music teachers launch their own successful endeavors. It's happened in home economics. Schools lose funding, and umpteen instructional cooking shows start popping up - along with home delivery meal prep businesses. It happened in the automotive field.

Many library patrons use the library specifically for internet access. Hell, my six figure earning, generationally wealthy boss used the local library for work because it was one of the first places with available internet after we got hit by a hurricane.

Access to fiction is also important, and it's also a form of knowledge. 

Libraries offer a variety of services that are instructive to both children and adults. My local library offers test prep and language classes for ESL residents.

Which, by the way, is a violation of the first amendment that has legal precedent. They can limit what people can checkout, what people can do. Look at Central York School District who banned anything with non-white characters or non-white history. A kid's biography about Martin Luther King Jr, Malala, Rosa Parks. All banned. Because a few parents mentioned that having books about non-white people was somehow ""unequal treatment of individuals"". This is dystopian thinking. And THIS is what a privatized public Library looks like. No freedom to read, study or enjoy what you like. Only their ""approved"" collections. You want to learn about Rosa Parks? Too bad, we're not allowed to have those books on our shelves.

And unless we have another Andrew Carnegie running around, Museums are not going to be privatized. They're not. There's no profit in them. They'll simply shut down.

If a private library opens and is as bad as you're describing (I agree with you... that picture you've painted sounds bleak), then open up a competing library, do it better, and put the bad one out of business. Open one with all the books, get a better board of directors (or use a different business model - not every enterprise has a -board), create revenue-generating programs, and grow your business. This is what every successful business does. If there's a market for your product (and there is clearly a market for libraries), then figure out how to capitalize on it. 

  
As far as museums go, if a museum can't generate a profit, I say they're not trying to. I will never believe that a 15 year-old with a webcam and a PlayStation can figure out how to generate millions of dollars, but a building filled with engineers and scientists can't. Even if they can't figure it out, surely someone in the building would have sense enough to hire a business administrator to do it for them. Hell, I'd take that job for a dollar a year salary if I got bonused on the profits. Museums have collections of the most unique and amazing items our planet has to offer. A large museum could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue if they had a mind to. And there's literally zero competition! There's only one Mona Lisa, right?

I'm speechless at someone trying to compare a museum to a YouTuber. Or how museums should be *for-profit*. I'm not even going to dignify that with a response. Again, are you trolling me? These are such insane takes that even an AI wouldn't dream of them.","ltr604u"

I'm not saying that libraries and museums SHOULD (sorry, I don't know how to make italics on here) be run that way. I'm saying that, if funding for them were to disappear, they would have to adapt. If they couldn't adapt, you're right... they would disappear.

  
There's also nothing saying that they would have to be for-profit. Non-profit organizations also have to generate revenue. Museums and libraries have a fair amount of overhead, so they would have to generate revenue commensurate with their costs. 

  
This is my point: even if Trump were to take away all of the funding to your local library, forcing them to close, there are other ways of operating. If you can't count on the government for funding, you'd have to come up with a way to fund yourself. There are ways to do that. Instead of blaming all their problems on politicians, maybe people should try getting off their asses and figuring out how to do things for themselves.","ltsllys"
