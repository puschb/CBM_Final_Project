But then I won‚Äôt find anything for the mood I‚Äôm in, so then I turn to Reddit book suggestion posts and find something of interest that *isn‚Äôt* on my shelves and then end up buying a new book.

"lqfr8ce","pktrekgirl","2024-10-05 10:47:48 UTC","I read at least 3 books at once: one classic literature, one current literature or an easy read classic lit book, and one non-fiction (usually history but occasionally true crime or religion) 

When I finish one, I replace it with the same type. So that narrows it down. I replace classic lit with classic lit, non-fiction with non-fiction, etc. 

In classic lit, I usually have a few focus authors going, and I switch between the authors with ‚Äòwild cards‚Äô in between. Right now my focus authors are Jane Austen Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Graham Greene. So I will do something like Jane Austen, Wild card, Dostoevsky, Wild card, Graham Green, Wild card, back to Jane Austen. 

In non-fiction, I switch between my main historical interest areas and then throw in a Wild card of either a new historical interest, a philosophy book, or a religion book. Or maybe even something completely different. But I don‚Äôt read two WWII books in a row. Or two Vietnam War books in a row. I like changing lanes and keeping it fresh. 

Current fiction is the loosest area. Right now because it‚Äôs October, all the books must have witches or vampires or must be horror except I have picked out one indigenous peoples book in honor of the holiday formerly know as Columbus Day.  I don‚Äôt have any ‚Äòliterary‚Äô fiction planned this month. But generally I read current literary fiction, current Japanese fiction, children‚Äôs fiction, etc in this category. I was already an adult when the Harry Potter books came out. So I am reading them now as part of this category. Not binging them tho. I‚Äôve read the first 3 since June 1 in between other things. 

Finally I throw in short stories like croutons. Classic ones, new sci-fi ones, whatever. No rules. 

The overall idea is to keep things fresh but at the same time make real progress with the catalogs of my favorite classical authors and my historical focus areas. 

This is how I choose to do that. YMMV.",""

The writing is incredible. McCarthy's style reminds me of Hemingway and Faulkner, with allusions to Paradise Lost and Moby-Dick. At times, the language feels biblical.

As I‚Äôm reading, I‚Äôve been researching more about McCarthy. He‚Äôs often regarded as one of the last great American authors. I hadn‚Äôt heard of this book until recently, but it turns out it‚Äôs taught at Yale and other universities. There are even online communities of readers who act as group therapy for those traumatized by the brutality lol

It‚Äôs not a hard book like Pynchon‚Äôs Gravity‚Äôs Rainbow, although there is a ton of vocabulary which I needed to look up. How can someone even know all these words? He uses archaic astrological words like ‚Äòanareta‚Äô, obscure military and religious terms, rare archaic English words that evoke an older, more primal world and adds to the novel's atmospheric and often unsettling tone.

I‚Äôm 50% in and already planning to read it again. I'm also curious to read his other works. 

I switch between reading the book and listening to the audio book. The narrator, Richard Poe, is excellent, and it helps for me to hear how some of the words and names of people and places are pronounced.

So, give that a try: pass a list of your favs to an LLM and ask for recommendations.",""

* Gather about 6-8 books; often fewer than that, rarely much more.
* Take stock of how long they are, chapter length, their genres, how popular they are in the moment, and other relatively objective aspects; of course, not all of these will matter in a given book-choosing.
* If especially desired, take a glance at reviews (professional, amateur, and casual), seeing if the books elicit particular responses that I'm in the mood for. Note: reading a review can help determine my mood, which is useful.
* Read the first chapter or so, whatever is available as a snippet on e.g. Amazon. 

Following the entire process is for those cases when I have literally no idea what I want to read, but in general, I tend to hone in one book pretty quickly. (I also don't read multiple books at the same time if I can help it.)

Besides picking a book, a big concept in going through most of this process is that it can help give me motivation to sharply switch gears. I usually struggle to go from one style of writing to another (struggle, as in, quickly take *big*/permanent breaks from a book), so this little mini-competition can really make a different type of book stand out and seem ""worth my while"".",""

Sometimes, I like to alternate between fiction and non-fiction, or choose books based on the season or current events. This can add a refreshing diversity to your reading experience. Another handy tactic is setting a monthly or quarterly reading goal that includes a mix of different types of books, which can guide you when you're scrolling through your list. Additionally, keeping a handful of curated recommendations from trusted friends or favorite authors can be a great way to make a quick choice without second-guessing.

Ultimately, it's about crafting a reading journey that keeps you engaged and excited. Listen to your mood, and don't be afraid to change direction if a certain book isn't grabbing you‚Äîreading should be enjoyable, not a chore.

I really liked Uprooted by Novik, Patricia McKillip and Tolkien as a whole, and he heard good things about Six of Crows, but all of those are pretty well-known fantasy people/titles. Kings of the Wyld was pretty fun, if you like old mercenaries coming out of retirement and some vulgarity.","lqfjd1f"
"lqhz85l","Zikoris","2024-10-05 18:59:08 UTC","I don't read anything in advance - when I'm on a trip I only like to read relevant books. I'm pretty loose with my definition of relevant and would count any of these:

* Set in the location
* By a local author
* Based on local religion/mythology
* In a place-inspired universe (examples: Aliette de Bodard's Vietnam-inspired Xuya series, L.E. Modesitt's France-inspired Imager series)
* Directly relevant to an activity I'm doing (example: Five Weeks in a Balloon for my hot air ballooning day)
* Nonfiction book about the location, history, or culture
* In a pinch, general travel-related books (example: Around the World in 80 Days)

I also go out of my way to buy one or two books locally that fit the above categories.","lqhxa5q"
"lqnsvwv","EmployeeHot6414","2024-10-06 19:10:27 UTC","So you always have something to read. I find that buying and reading books are different hobbies. So when I'm in a buying mood I create a stack of books I actually want to read. My TBR is always less than 10.","lqnpcr7"

And your non-fiction prompt reminded me of a Theodore Roosevelt biography I keep meaning to get to. There are a few suspense/thriller type books on my list which seems to fit the October vibes...and I'm going to have some fun with the Wild Card notion. A great approach - thanks again, and happy reading!","lqhsu58"
