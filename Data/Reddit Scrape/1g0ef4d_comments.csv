Read a version that's been as unadulterated as possible, or something as close to the OG as you can properly digest; learning Biblical Hebrew, or Aramaic, or even Ancient Greek, can be too much of an ask for anyone who isn't a historian or a theologian. If you are familiar with any sort of Latin, saying this for anyone who might be starting to look into the subject, my apologies if you already knew, any materials that are post-1054 won't help a lot. Rome and Constantinople started doing their utmost to establish their own identities after the Great Schism, a bunch of other 'heresies' were also going about (Bogomilism, of all things, survived partially as elements of tradition, which the Orthodoxes value as much as dogma)... it is a bit of a mess.
