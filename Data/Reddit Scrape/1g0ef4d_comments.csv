Read a version that's been as unadulterated as possible, or something as close to the OG as you can properly digest; learning Biblical Hebrew, or Aramaic, or even Ancient Greek, can be too much of an ask for anyone who isn't a historian or a theologian. If you are familiar with any sort of Latin, saying this for anyone who might be starting to look into the subject, my apologies if you already knew, any materials that are post-1054 won't help a lot. Rome and Constantinople started doing their utmost to establish their own identities after the Great Schism, a bunch of other 'heresies' were also going about (Bogomilism, of all things, survived partially as elements of tradition, which the Orthodoxes value as much as dogma)... it is a bit of a mess.

The most memorable bible class, where we had to illustrate some passages from a certain section:

Judges 15:15
> Then he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, so he reached out with his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it.

It also seemed pretty cheap and basic.  Very mediocre type setting, pages stuck together, etc. The reviewer thought it was like any other number of $10-15 faux leather Bibles from China.","lr8u9m9"

Really? Do you also have a degree in biology? Do you teach biology in Alabama?

No.
