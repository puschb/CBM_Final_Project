"lxx5hj2","Zalzaron","2024-11-19 13:05:44 UTC","There is a complicated cross-over between the Civil Rights movement and the Nation of Islam, which absolutely had significant anti-semitic views.

The Civil Rights movement and groups like the Nation of Islam, worked together to fight against the racism of the 60's. They often did so being approaching it from different perspectives. Some groups sought equality with whites, wanting an end to segregation. Others sought a project of Black independence, like the Nation of Islam did, wanting to construct parallel infrastructure (such as their own banks, businesses, etc).

Being allies in the same struggle, doesn't of course necessarily means that you are allies in every sense.

But it does also explain why some older black people and black liberation groups, are more protective of groups like the Nation of Islam, then they should be. Because they were allies in the same struggle, and considered the critiques on the NOI to be intended as a means of distracting from the Civil Right's movements core objective (racial equality).

However, both can be true. It's true that critiques of the NOI for anti-semitism can be historically intended to drive a wedge into the Civil Right's movement, while also being factually true that the NOI was a deeply anti-semitic group.

Just like it's also true that these accusations are true, whilst also acknowledging that they likely would not have surfaced if Coates' *The Message* had not been recently released. Irregardless of the quality of Coates' most recent book, which is yet another seperate conversation.",""

Criticism of Israel is not antisemitism no matter how many times the ADL says it is, or how badly the ADL wants it to be. In fact, many of the most vocal critics of Israel are Jewish themselves.

If I understand correctly, the main criticism is that he published a book by Tony Martin, a college professor who caused controversy by uncritically using Nation of Islam teaching materials which contained debunked antisemitic conspiracy theories that basically blame Jews for the Transatlantic slave trade. After Jewish students complained about this, Martin then wrote the book ""The Jewish Onslaught"" (published by Coates) which is basically a vintage cancel culture rant, where Martin blames the Jews at his college for trying to silence him and cover up that Jews have always hated black people. 


It should be noted that Martin did not just spread antisemitic conspiracy theories in his classrooms, he also spoke at a Holocaust Denial conference held by one of the most well-known Holocaust denial organisations, the far-right Institute for Historical Review. The title of his lecture was ""Tactics of Organized Jewry in Suppressing Free Speech.""


I do not think that the fact that Martin was an open and committed antisemite is in any way controversial. 


That's why there's scrutiny about the people who gave him a platform.

In it, Martin is publicizing the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, much as Henry Ford did in the Dearborn Independent. I'm not a believer in cancelling people, but publishing or promoting antisemitic content makes you an antisemite. In case you don't know, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a fraudulent document written in Tsarist Russia that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century","lxx40db"

> It’s why, in Israel, there is a historic racism of Sephardi (Black) and Mizrahi (Arabic) Jews by Ashkenazi (White) Jews.  °

Literally where did you get that from, that's not remotely true. Sephardic/Misrahi/Ashkenazi describe Jewish communities and their religious traditions. Sephardic Jews historically lived in Spain, Ashkenazi Jews in Central/Eastern Europe and Misrahi in Northern Africa and the Middle East. In those communities different interpretations/standards developed (e.g. do you eat rice on Pessach). The people who live according to the interpretations of those Eastern European Jews or are descended from them are Ashkenazi, etc. In religious communities, the affiliation is usually determined by the husband, who also passes it on to the children. If you convert, you take up the religious traditions/interpretations of the Rabbi you convert with. E.g. Drake, a black man whose mother is Ashkenazi, is Ashkenazi. A white Ashkenazi woman who marries a Sephardic man becomes Sephardic (though if neither of them are religious she might not take up his traditions and therefore consider herself still Ashkenazi). An Arab woman who converts through an Ashkenazi synagogue becomes Ashkenazi.","lxxf1qj"

Conspiracy theories don't work mathematically. Someone published a study about it a while back, but the gist is that the sheer number of people it would take to maintain the conspiracy  is directly proportional to the likelihood it falls apart. Basically, it only takes one asshole to tell someone what's happening and the more people involved, the more likely one of them is that kind of asshole. I've had a little bit of success using this logic with people. I ask them to consider how many people from how many countries would have to be involved in keeping this secret. Then ask about a time one of their (or their friend's) secrets got out. How many people knew? It often works better if the countries involved hate each other. Flat earth is one (of course that one can often fall apart if you just ask why, like what do ""they"" gain by keeping it secret).
