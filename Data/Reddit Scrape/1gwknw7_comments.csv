Look, I read all Witcher books when they came out, and it's one of my favourite book series, but the writer is obviously trying to capitalize on popularity while it lasts.

He didn't care about Witcher for years, sold TV and game rights for scraps, and when the game suddenly increased the Universe's popularity, he tried to sue CDPR for money.

Then he let Netflix absolutely rape and brutalize the source material for TV show, obviously for money. If he cared for books and was passionate for the world as you say, that series would never been such a disgrace.

And now with show closed, he still wants more money, so he's writing ""young"" Geralt book, lol.

I would love him to be passionate and caring for the Witcher universe, but he's just greedy. Which is okay, by the way.

So it's not toxicity, it's just sad reality.","lybh9ek"

Lol, talk about hyperbole. Most of it is Ciri going on very weird adventures.

They're definitely fantasy throughout, but they become less Brandon Sanderson *fantasy action* and more Arthurian (medieval, not modern versions), which is totally different than what people signed up for and so it's understandable people dislike it. The ending books are very anticlimactic and against mainstream fantasy expectations but that's what I liked about them. Personally I think fantasy politics are inherently uninteresting so I'm glad the books didn't focus on that beyond as a way to give the characters growth.","lybb73r"

Yeah, there are only two, no, three, no, four, wait,  five, actually I think six people who tried or wanted to do that. One of them a rando throwaway cannibal who has nothing to do with the plot and is just thrown in for shock value and another who also vivisects women.

Yeah people want Ciri to have a child but there's only one actual (attempted) rape scene that I remember, then an abusive partner and then a whole long plot  whose conclusion is exactly that Ciri is not an object, not for her family, not for politics, not as a woman, not even for ""the greater good."" For a fantasy novel from 1990 that's not only relatively tame but also much more focused on the actual woman as a human being than, for instance, all of GRRM. You might as well say Alien is just constant sexual assault with no value, too, at that point (though I'll concede Alien does do it better).","lybcxj4"

>A little over one year later, however, Sapkowski had second thoughts. In a bold letter to CD Projekt, made public in October 2018, he claimed that under Polish law he was wrongfully underpaid for his work. His demand for compensation from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt alone amounted to more than $16.11 million in royalties. At the time CD Projekt wrote in an official statement to its investors that his demands were “groundless.”

>“The Company had legitimately and legally acquired copyright to Mr. Andrzej Sapkowski’s work,” CD Projekt stated, “insofar as is required for its use in games developed by the Company. All liabilities payable by the Company in association therewith have been properly discharged.”

>Nevertheless, CD Projekt left the door to negotiations open.

>In a brief press release issued today, CD Projekt said that it and Sapkowski “signed an agreement further solidifying their relationship.” This new agreement, the statement continues, “satisfies and fully clarifies the needs and expectations of both parties, past and present, and sets out a framework for the future cooperation between the two sides.” It applies not only to video games, but also to graphic novels, board games, and other associated merchandise.

"lybesfc","Prothean_Beacon","2024-11-21 22:00:13 UTC","Sexual assault is more than just rape. Like I guess saying she only got raped in two scenarios is accurate but it ignores all the other people who tried to do it and failed. And ignores that one of the scenarios involved Ciri being repeatedly raped over a period of time. And also ignore the plethora of people who don't actually try anything but are openly lusting after a young teenage girl.

Like I'm not saying Ciri doesn't have any good development or agency, I'm just pointing out that there's a lot of rape and SA of a minor character. And especially at the end it becomes a huge focus of large parts of the novels.","lybdgix"

"lybfe14","onceuponalilykiss","2024-11-21 22:03:22 UTC","I probably just remember all those parts less well than you do, which fair enough. To me what stood out is that Ciri is not really a minor character, though, and she's very well written. Certainly if the stuff surrounding her story upsets people that's fine and reasonable, but I also still think it's much better written overall than the first few books.

Would the books be even better if you took out a lot of that stuff? Probably, yes. But I still find them to be interesting and good enough to stand on their own, which is more than I can say for basically 99% of fantasy.  I'll generally take a flawed story that tries something new over the ""perfectly"" paced action, no flaws, no ugly parts that make you question what the author was thinking.

For example, sticking to general fantasy novels, I also am disappointed with a lot of what the latter parts of the Gormenghast series do with the female characters, but that doesn't stop me from saying it's a fantastic series (and ok unfair comparison because Gormenghast is surely higher on the literature totem pole, but the point stands). For even older classics it becomes even more common to go ""wow okay that was kind of racist/sexist"" but the novel can still be good, you know? That's what I'm getting at. Now, Witcher was ""only"" the 90s but the genre in general is pretty far behind on all this shit.","lybesfc"

Man, if you think Ciri is a minor character then we must have read different books. Ciri is the MacGuffin of the story, the one thing that everyone wants to get their hands on. And the reason they want that is her blood/genes, so even that theme of people wanting her to have offspring or vivisecting her etc. is not gratuitous but makes sense.","lybesfc"
