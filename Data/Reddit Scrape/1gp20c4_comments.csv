"lwq3jwq","as_it_was_written","2024-11-12 09:30:20 UTC",">Does he wrote women poorly? Yes, but I don’t think he writes men well either.

Personally, I think he writes many of his characters really well. They just don't have much insight into what's going on in their lives, so their internal dialog isn't as deep as some people would like. A lot of complaints about how Murakami writes his characters come across as readers just wishing he had written different characters, as opposed to wishing he had written *these* characters better. 

This is especially true for his female characters since many of them are portrayed exclusively through a male first-person protagonist. Writing those women ""better"" wouldn't necessarily involve changing them at all, but it would require a different protagonist who sees them differently. (That's not to say he writes a woman's perspective well when he does attempt it, but those instances are a clear minority among the complaints I've seen re: the way he writes women.) 

To me, Murakami's characters are - on the whole, anyway - more realistic than all the overly insightful and reliable first-person narrators I've come across. (Granted, the latter is a pet peeve of mine. Authors who don't acknowledge that first-person narrators are inherently unreliable just aren't for me.)

>What I love is his weird fever dream surrealism. I know what I’m going to get with one of his novels and sometimes that’s what I enjoy. Is he the greatest author, ect? No- but neither are a lot of writers I enjoy.

FWIW this is pretty much how I feel too. Among authors I like, Murakami is probably in the B tier.","lwnh0m9"

I actually really like his novels a lot (aside from Norwegian Wood, which I loathe), but I agree with folks that his handling of women and sex is pretty laughable. And not in the sense that it exists in his books at all (as claimed by some who really want to dismiss the criticism), but the fact that in so many of them women seem to be completely defined by their sexual presence and availability. 

Even then I could excuse it as part and parcel of his generally murky and dreamlike narrative voice, except that’s a well that he can’t seem to keep himself from returning to every chance he gets—and we know how Murakami likes his wells.","lwn173g"
"lwnqm6b","KernelKrusto","2024-11-11 22:56:50 UTC","People today are too used to reading crappy, uncomplicated writing.  They like their books like they like all their entertainment: predictable, easy to understand, and comporting with their sensibilities.  That's what a steady diet of garbage does for you.  Critical thinking goes out the window because a young adult character thinks about boobs, and that's more important to focus on.

Just look at the comments in this thread.  There's broad generalizations with zero analysis.  Just vitriol.  I feel sorry for them.  They've happily closed their eyes and deprived themselves of a world of literature because of some strange hill to die on.  And when you call them on it, they cherry-pick some passage and accuse you of predilections that comport with those passages.  

I just finished reading *Never Let Me Go* this morning, and when I went to rate it on my personal Goodreads page, made the mistake of looking at some reviews people had written.  He won the fucking Nobel Prize in Literature for it, and people called it a snoozefest.

"lx07eo9","bravetailor","2024-11-14 00:02:23 UTC","I agree that Murakami's characters aren't bad. I think his male characters have a ring of truth to them, at least for those who are willing to be *honest* about the straight male psyche. His male characters often think about sex a lot, have repressed aggression, and have a failure to articulate their thoughts and feelings well to other characters. These are elements that he manages to portray quite poignantly at times.

In his novels his women are often mysterious and difficult to figure out. Coming from a male POV, I can say that is definitely quite relatable at times! 

My own criticism is that a lot of his characters are kind of samey from novel to novel. He has about 4 or 5 character types which his recycles over and over. Which wouldn't be bad if he wrote only 2 books every 20 years. But because he's fairly prolific, you start to see the patterns more easily","lwq3jwq"

Reddit does tend to be utterly zealous over things like calling him a creep, but I don’t think he writes women very well, and do think a large part of the people who enjoy Murakami are disaffected young men who idealise the sort of passive consumption of life that he presents. Relationships just appear, things sort of happen, one doesn’t really have to do much work for a basic life. That can absolutely have influence on how a work is perceived, and it has never been greater than in this unfortunate era of ‘fandom’.

This is true of all media in all cultures. It's kind of true to this day in some ways.

Not that long ago, this was kind of the norm for young women, so it wasn't that weird to have stories about it. It was only a few hundred years ago when it started being weird to do stuff like marry 12 year olds, and only in certain places. Today, there are places where people still marry 12 year olds.

Murakami is a man who enjoys having sex with women, and writes books from the point of view of men who enjoy having sex with women. They aren't thinking about other men or themselves like that, because why would they? But they do think about the women they meet like that, so they notice those details, so those get written down.

If you don't like that, then it should be simple enough to not read his books, nobody is forcing you to.

For women, you’re getting the Brontë sisters, Woolf, Austen, then maybe Morrison, and after that things tend to run dry, at least from what I’ve seen. So I can understand the “dude-lit” allegations, like the authors are all great, but they tend towards being a load of men.","lwnh0l4"

It's quite interesting reading criticism of Murakami from the 80s and 90s by figures of Japan's literary establishment, such as Kenzaburō Ōe and Kojin Karatani. Karatani even dismissed Murakami early in his career for appealing to 'college aged girls' with Norwegian Wood, as if a novel appealing to a female demographic was a bad thing (although, I'd personally be surprised if that was the core demographic who loved Norwegian Wood in Japan).

Yeah, I've come across that sentiment, too. It reminds me of people who think No Country for Old Men is a bad action movie because it doesn't have enough action. 

>It might just because I've known a lot of people who tried to avoid reality by escaping into some idealized fantasy that has no connection with reality, but that's all I see it as.

I think it's a little more nuanced than that. As I read it, Lolita is full of deliberately irresolvable ambiguity. Even when it's obvious Humbert isn't accurately depicting an event, we aren't really in a position to know whether he's deluded or just presenting himself as such. After all, the whole novel is essentially a plea for leniency. 

>With the added element of the main character doing a ton of blatantly immoral stuff in order to achieve his fantasy, making it impossible to really empathize with him.

I hope you mean sympathize? Agreeing with someone's actions or sharing their moral framework isn't necessary for empathy. 

I also think it's worth keeping in mind that some of the aspects we consider blatantly immoral today were more of a gray area back when the novel was published. The idealized version of events that Humbert presents isn't too far from the Rock star/groupie relationships that were considered decadent but ultimately acceptable for much of the 20th century.

Yeah, to the extent that Ted Nugent became the legal guardian of an underage girl with her parents' approval and then later married her.

> Reading it from today's moral perspective, where even the most unrealistically charitable interpretation is clearly completely unacceptable, makes the whole thing less interesting imo.

I don't engage with media, or history, in this way at all. There are a lot of historical works I will never read, because I think they're gross. The Tale of Genji being one of them, as one of the major story threads is the main character abducting a 10 year old girl from the countryside to turn into his ideal wife. I really have no interest in hearing their story.

And for that matter, I don't really care what was ""normal"" at the time. If I think it was wrong, then that's all I can think about it. Sending 14 year olds into the mines was wrong. Slavery was wrong, even if everyone was doing it 1000 years ago. Anyone engaging in slavery in a piece of media that I'm reading is the bad guy, and my primary hope is that they die in the story.

In that case we're talking about the same thing. My point was that we have no way of knowing whether he ever actually had those delusions. All we know is that he portrays the situation as though he had them. 

>And for that matter, I don't really care what was ""normal"" at the time. If I think it was wrong, then that's all I can think about it.

I didn't mean to imply you should let it affect your perception of what is right or wrong in the world of the novel. But the entire narrative is an appeal to a contemporary audience, so what they think about the morality of the situation fundamentally affects how Humbert portrays it. We don't have to change our own positions or make excuses for people in the past in order to acknowledge they had different values. 

For example, I completely agree that slavery was just as bad in the past when it was even more common. However, a character advocating for slavery a few centuries ago is not the same as doing so in modern times. The morality of the action hasn't changed, but the cultural context and the reactions they can reasonably expect are drastically different, so the action still says different things about the character depending on the time period.","lwrnprm"

Even in windup bird it's ""what if the man only sort of knew what he was signing up for but goes along with it anyway"" and oh yeah the dream thing again.","lwvk2pv"

"lwqa4yd","AtraMikaDelia","2024-11-12 10:44:06 UTC","So a book primarily concerned with characters falling in love and their emotions is not a romance if it has other themes?

To me it seems like describing a book that's primarily about romance as a *romance book"" is logical, but I guess you've got some other definition.

Edit: I can't reply to anyone below me b/c the person above me blocked me, but even if some people try to redefine a word, you can't be surprised when some people keep using the original definition. Do we just not have a name for more serious books that are about people falling in love anymore?","lwq9hcb"

Romance can still be a component of any book. If it doesn't follow the rules for a romance, it shouldn't be categorized as romance because it would piss off a lot of romance readers who are looking for something specific.","lwqa4yd"
