"lrpeeor","Jarita12","2024-10-13 11:35:13 UTC","Start with something you either know and read before or something relatively easy. We have books where one page is in English and translation is on the other side so you can compare so I am sure something like that exists almost everywhere.

My first book in English was Harry Potter. I was about 15 when book 5 was out and it took a few months to get translated version and also, spoilers were everywhere so I did not want to wait. They even said who would die in the book on TV news like a few hours after the book was out. I was in the middle of reading it and was pissed.

In any case, that is an example of a relatively easy book to read. I was surprised how much I understood, I found what the new invented words meant (like within HP world - Quidditch, that had our own word - kudos to the translator who is one of our best) but struggled a bit with not so common words (like I could not figure out what ""Couldron"" meant, it was not in any dictionary I had :D )

But otherwise, it was relatively easy read because it was still aimed at children and young adult. Lots of ""He said"", ""She said:""....

And I went from there.

So I recommend to start with something relatively easy, have a dictionary at hand and it will help you to get through it and you learn new words.

I tried that with a couple of German books as well but my German got very rusty since high school and I am constantly kicking myself to read and talk in German but I am struggling and failing :D

I used a Firefox extension so I could get the meaning of a word by hovering it, so the suggestion to use an e-reader with a dictionary (Kobo is great!) is a good idea. 

Some tips my language teachers gave me over the years :   
-To not always try to translate/look up each word you don't understand. Read the entire sentence/paragraph and try to understand what the word is from context, first. (I was also told to watch shows/movies without subs first, to work on comprehension, and then use subs to see if you got everything)

"lrpv2ie","NorthernSparrow","2024-10-13 13:45:32 UTC","Hey OP, I have been in the same boat when trying to get through official government webpages in Brazil. People’s advice in this thread is good for learning a language generally, but just be aware that official documents will use specialized vocabulary, formal phrasing and a lot of complicated syntax, to the point where it can feel like a different dialect. Like, with Portuguese I felt like I had to learn three different forms of the language: (1) informal spoken language, (2) fiction writing, (3) “official” written Portuguese, which includes not just things like tax forms and visa forms, but also a lot of formally-written nonfiction like newspaper articles. (like for example, look up a newspaper article that is reporting a Supreme Court decision and you’ll see how specialized the vocabulary can get)

What I did when I was learning was carefully (and slowly) read the top story of a reputable newspaper every day (yes, an actual newspaper - I chose the most famous one in the country - that’ll give you exposure to “official” writing style). I also read fiction books, AND ALSO watched Portuguese tv shows & movies with captions on. You have to read very slowly and be willing to keep pausing to look up words and phrases you don’t know. I used to spend so much time rewinding and replaying a movie scene that it would take me a week to get through one movie, lol. 

Google Translate is a godsend, but keep going back and forth between Google Translate and the original text to figure out where multi-word phrases start and end. (example: “get down”, “get over”, and “get across” all have informal slang meanings that are very different from each other! And if you just look up “get” you won’t discover those phrases.) 

I found it really helpful to keep a little journal where I wrote down every new word and phrase (writing it down helps you remember it). This will take a long time - think of it like your project or hobby. I used to work on Portuguese  two hours every night, and even after three years living in Rio I still felt like I still wasn’t truly fluent. But I’d got to the point where Brazilian friends thought I was fluent. You will get there.

BTW if you need help navigating a complicated document right now, find a trusted friend who is a native English speaker who can sit down with you and go over it line by line. Feel free to dm me if you want assistance (so many Brazilians helped me with stuff like this, and I would love to pass on the favor).",""
"lrqhu9m","reUsername39","2024-10-13 15:57:46 UTC","the best advice I got (probably from somewhere here on reddit) was to focus on dialogue heavy texts.

I also find something written in modern language rather than something old-fashioned (like Crime and Punishment...or in the case of the first book I attempted The Secret Garden) to be so much easier.  

I'm currently so proud of myself for how well I'm doing with a book I'm reading in German.  It's a newly released thriller with a lot of dialogue-heavy sections.  When I sit down to read, I have a pen and my phone open to Google translate.  I can get by without translating much, but I choose to stop and translate some words on most pages so I can remember them better and build my vocabulary...usually new adjectives I haven't encountered yet.

I started small to build vocabulary and confidence by reading fanfictions online. I did it first with oneshot of fandom that I liked and easily knew of the characters and universe. It was rough : I was checking the dictionary all the time and wrote down every new words. But since I loved the fandoms and started with really short stories, it was easier to keep being motivated. I even started translating a few to improve myself. I naturally read twoshots, then threeshots. And before I knew it, I was reading full fanfictions as long as published novels, only driven by the curiosity to know the story and not focusing of every little things I didn’t knew of or learned yet. A few years after my first english fanfiction, I finally read my first paper novels. And now I don’t care about reading either in my first or second language : I still make mistakes when I need to actively use it but my general comprehension is good enough to enjoy content in it, which is enough for me.

Children, middle grade, and YA litt is awesome because it’s meant to be more available for a younger target audience, so the language isn’t necessarily going to be *the* most difficult thing you gotta deal with. Heck, there’s some pretty good picture books out there that you could use to boost your confidence if you need the odd break. I know some family friends who used comics to help with the language learning, and have a book club friend who’s using books with shorter chapters to have that morale boost as she’s trying to get more into the language.

Main point: take easy, gentle steps as your introductory point, then it’ll be easier to try to get to those heftier texts down the line e.g. when you feel like a government web page ain’t such a struggle. There’s a bunch of different ways of doing it, and guaranteed literature that’s enjoyable to read while you’re doing it.

Duolingo was a big help there. It is one of the most robust series in the app. Babbel is apparently pretty good as well. 

A friend in high school once told me the best way she learned a language was to have a dictionary in that language and translate word by word from target language to native language. Eventually the vocabulary sinks in. This is an indirect approach to acquiring the grammar, but it helps there too. 

I like detective novels, so I bought copies of the first Harry Hole detective novel, The Bat Man by Jo Nesbo, originally written in Norwegian. One copy in Norwegian, one copy in English. So I can check my work. 

I also found text that looks geared towards 8th graders, that introduces Norwegian grammar while telling an engaging story along the way.

I have learned to read in French, and I am on the verge of learning to read in German. There are all sorts of   reading skills that you probably need to relearn in your target language-- how to follow a plot, how to remember characters, how to infer vocabulary from context, how to read for hours and hours willingly. I could feel it working, so chasing that bit of dopamine kept me reading.

notes: some authors of graded readers are much better than others. Beware of AI generated crap. 

I prefer to read books that I have not read before. The only thing that my limited command of French and German allows is plot. If I am already familiar with the plot, I'd probably end up comparing it to the time I read it in English, and the foreign language version will pale in comparison. In a few years, things may change...

One funny thing-- ""Trigger warnings"" never made much sense to me, until I was reading a book in German, and out of the fog of semi-comprehensible narrative came a somewhat too vivid description of a corpse.

It was about a subject I was comfortable with (history), targeted towards non-specialists, so written in relatively accessible language. I highlighted words I didn’t know, tried to discern their meaning from the context. I looked up their meaning only when I was done with a chunk of text, to not break my pace, and also tried to get their pronunciation correctly. I would also read passages aloud. Obviously, this is a tedious process and takes away from the reading pleasure. At some point, i started reading movie and fashion magazines in English - pretty easy language, but complex and correct enough that you are having a good reading time. Strictly in my experience, it’s much easier to start with nonfiction, be it books or articles. Fiction will contain more metaphorical language, more words you might not be familiar with etc. As an alternative, middle grade can also be a good starting point, as they are usually written in shorter simpler sentences, with less flowery language, and a more accessible message.",""

"ls262co","inabookhole","2024-10-15 16:25:36 UTC","I started reading in my second language by choosing children’s and young adult books. I know the stories might not really be your thing and could sometimes seem... a bit simple, but if you look at them purely from a vocabulary or grammar perspective, they’re perfect.

If you can find a series, like Harry Potter for example, that gradually targets an older audience as it progresses, you’ll be able to improve your language skills step by step, which will help you better understand what you’re reading and integrate new vocabulary.

One tip I’d give you is to start with a book you’re already familiar with in your native language, so you have a rough idea of what each part of the book is about. This will make it easier to follow the story. As you gain knowledge and proficiency in the new language, you can explore different titles.

Honestly, a very clever way to guide you during the whole experience of reading in a second language.

It also have some great perks.. for example, long time ago I was reading Armada, by Ernest Cline, and decided to also  play the audiobook, just for the fun of it, and because it helps to keep you practicing once you are not using, in this case, English on regular bases.

"ls7qjx5","Unhappy_Current8928","2024-10-16 15:31:51 UTC","Hey! I am an avid reader and learnt Swedish and German solely by reading books in those languages. Here is my takeaway:
 Most people who talk about using books to learn a language offer extremely unhelpful and unrealistic advice. Jumping straight to complex works like Goethe's Faust to practice your german, just because it happens to be one of the greatest literary works in german is not a particularly good idea and yet people kept suggesting it to me. Annotating books and looking up every single word isn't going to be particularly helpful either, nor is it sustainable in the long run. 


 Reading books that are easy or books you have already read as others mentioned is a great place to start. Regardless of that, read books you are actually interested in reading to ensure that the whole thing won't feel like a chore. I would also suggest starting with books that have been translated rather than written in this language as the vocabulary is usually simpler. Remember the more you read, the more often you see the same words over and over again and the easier it is to learn them.  


I for one read a lot of agatha christie books in Swedish. They are easy to read, keep you wanting to read more to see what happens and use everyday vocabulary. If you like crime fiction in general I'd say it's the perfect genre for language practice. ",""
