"lplz2or","Deleted","2024-09-30 05:37:53 UTC","I'm recommending another classic - Anne of Green Gables by LM Montgomery. I think it will scratch a similar itch that To Kill a Mockingbird did for you, even though they're very different books. You might have already heard of it, but in case you haven't - it's set in a rural community in Canada at the end of the nineteenth century, so there's a sense of quaintness and community and a slower-paced way of life I think you'd like. Matthew and Marilla, a middle aged brother and sister, send a request to an orphanage for a teenage boy to help them keep up their farm, but they get Anne, an eleven year old girl, by mistake. Of course, they end up loving her so much that they keep her anyway, although there are some bumps along the way. Montgomery's writing is sweet without being sugary, cozy without being stifling, heart-warming without being eye-rolling. Anne is so intensely lovable - one of my favorite characters of all time. And if you like it, there's a whole series for you to enjoy.",""

Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia C Wrede the characters are fun and funny it was one of the books I read in my youth that made me feel like it was okay to be myself.

Anne of Green Gables (the whole series) by L.M. Montgomery is perfection.

Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien I have never once failed to find something new and uplifting in a read through of those books.

Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis same as Lord of the Rings, there’s always something warming with those books.

Pickwick Papers, Christmas Carol, and Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens they all deal with some heavy stuff, but there are some laugh out loud moments in each of them and Sam Weller and Mr. Pickwick are my heroes.

Sarah Plain and Tall by Patricia MacLachlan is a teeny tiny book but it is so comforting.

Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling 

Sword in the Stone and Queen of Air and Darkness by T.H. White (you can read the whole series in Once and Future King, but it’s really the first two that are the most comforting) which is King Arthur and there’s a lot of humor and warm descriptions that bring you right into the world

"lpoo3iw","puttingonmygreenhat","2024-09-30 18:04:16 UTC","So many fabulous comments! Personally, I'd recommend *Six Harvests in Lea, Texas* by Sam Starbuck.

>“Six Harvests in Lea, Texas” is the story of Wilder Mayer, a young man returning to the rural panhandle town of Lea to take over the family farm after his stepfather’s death.

>Lea is a strange place, from the mysterious old ruined church to the charismatic new schoolteacher that Wild wouldn’t mind marrying, and eventually to their witchy daughter, Iscah, who might be a prophet.

>Set at the height of the Dust Bowl and the Depression, Six Harvests follows Wild, his ever-growing family, and the farmers of Lea as they struggle to survive both the tragedies befalling America and the tragedies of their own small town.

It might sound like a sad story, but I found it really uplifting! The whole family is consistently kind to each other, and overall it feels like a very gentle, loving story. I enjoyed it a lot :)

It's self-published, and I believe there's a free version of this book on his website if you wanted to try reading a sample. Highly recommend!",""

"lpp3dey","Gold_Major770","2024-09-30 19:24:30 UTC","It's remarkable how certain books resonate with us on such a deep level, especially during difficult times. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" has an undeniable warmth, largely because of its portrayal of genuine compassion and enduring justice, embodied by characters like Atticus Finch. It's that blend of realism with the goodness of human spirit that provides comfort.

For more of that soul-soothing, comforting embrace, you might find a similar refuge in ""A Man Called Ove"" by Fredrik Backman. Despite its surface grumpiness, it's a heartfelt exploration of community, kindness, and the healing power of human connection. The story digs deep into the loneliness of its protagonist, but it also beautifully shows how even the prickliest people can find warmth and love in unexpected places.

Another book that comes to mind is ""Anne of Green Gables"" by L.M. Montgomery. The tale of Anne Shirley's adventures and her boundless imagination bring a sense of joy and a feeling of being cherished. The close-knit community of Avonlea and the relationships Anne forms reinforce the idea that kindness and community spirit are essential aspects of life.

And if you're looking for non-fiction, consider Mitch Albom's ""Tuesdays with Morrie."" It's a touching memoir that presents life lessons on love, work, community, family, and death, through the lens of a series of conversations between the author and his former college professor. The wisdom imparted in those dialogues can feel like a gentle hug to the soul.

Ultimately, the best books for this kind of comfort are often those that balance the recognition of life's challenges with an underlying message of hope, compassion, and human connection. Keep exploring and you'll likely find more hidden gems that speak to your heart in the same way ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" does.",""

It's a fiction featuring the author & his wife as the main characters, exploring the metaphors of thought, religion, human nature & our connection to the world past & future in our own present.

It's about a Quaker family in the early/mid-1800s.

The next stories deal with Jess and Eliza's decision to move to southern Indiana (where West was from and which she describes perfectly), building their orchard farm and raising their children.

"lpxvzzw","FriendshipPure6269","2024-10-02 06:59:42 UTC","Okay, so I have different books depending on your mood. 
I love a cozy mystery for when life is complicated. The “detective” solves the puzzle without the trauma of a thriller. (Thrillers, especially psychological thrillers, trigger my anxiety. I’m usually safer with cozier mysteries.) In this category, I like Ellery Adams’ Book Retreat series (I also love that it’s in such a book people setting), but Murder in the Reading Room (book 5 in the series) is a bit more intense and didn’t sit well with me. I also enjoy a Miss Marple book or The Vampire Knitting Club when I’m in this type of mood. 
If you’re into urban/low fantasy, Fred, the Vampire Accountant is a wonderful series where a super awkward, nerdy guy gets changed into a vampire, becomes more of a loner, and then builds a wonderful found family of supernatural misfits (and some powerful friends who enjoy being able to escape the politics for a while). If you don’t mind the “free” reading apps, The 5 Time Rejected Gamma and the Lycan King has this bad ass warrior who had to decide who she becomes when dealing with five different fated-mates rejecting her, only to discover yet another mate, and try to make it work. I enjoy how strong Lucy became as a result of the rejections, and found inspiration in her having to 100% accept who she was as a person. (I also deeply love the Mercy Thompson/Alpha and Omega series by Patricia Briggs, but I can’t compare it to a hug.)
Also, if you’re feeling lonely, The Secret Life of Addie LaRue is awesome, but it made me sob and won’t give you anything like a hug. She made a deal over a century ago, and now she doesn’t age, etc, but no one can ever remember her, so she is extremely isolated. 
Long time favorites, especially something you read when you were young, are especially comforting when you’re going through it. It doesn’t matter if it’s Little Women or Captain Underpants if it touches you. Remember C.S. Lewis: No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally – and often far more – worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.
Also, if you want something leaning into friendship, The Bromance Book Club by Lyssa Kay Adams shows a group of men showing up for their friends. 
There are also a lot of really good recommendations from other posters",""

1) *All Creatures Great and Small* (equivalent to the UK *If Only They Could Talk*, and *It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet*) 

2) All Things Bright and Beautiful (equivalent to the UK *Let Sleeping Vets Lie* and *Vet In Harness*) 

3) All Things Wise and Wonderful  (equivalent to the UK *Vets Might Fly* and *Vet in a Spin* )

Then in the UK and US the books match up, with *The Lord God Made Them All*, and *Every Living Thing*. Just of course in the UK, those are books 7 and 8, and in the US, they're books 4 and 5. 

Utterly fantastic books. Autobiographical too, though professional ethics and rules of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons at the time which banned any advertising - he was still a practicing vet when the books began to be published - prevented him using his own name, so people and place names, locations, and so on were changed. James Herriot's real name was Alf Wight, and the town of Darrowby, where the books were set, is in reality the town of Thirsk, and you can in fact go and visit the very house where the veterinary practice was - it's now a museum in his honour.","lpm1qnk"

Emily is an orphan like Anne, but also an aspiring writer, and I felt she had this inner fire that was more relatable and inspiring. From what I remember the books were so vibrant and captivating, the characters interesting and engaging, and I was incredibly lucky to encounter them growing up as Emily and her friends contain strong, smart, complex women/girls.

"lptxccr","RoutinePost7443","2024-10-01 16:08:44 UTC","Alf Wight continued working there in the house, 23 Kirkgate, Thirsk, in partnership with Donald Sinclair (my dad;-) for decades. More accurately, they worked out of the house, using it as an office, as they were mostly large-animal vets going to farms. They did see some small-animal clients at the house of course. We always called it ""the surgery"".

It's quite a big house; although what you see at the front doesn't give that impression it runs back alongside a once-lovely walled garden. It was my dad's house so when he married in 1943 the upstairs continued to be their home for a couple of years; after mum had me they moved to a rented house outside of town (where my sister was born). I don't know where Alf lived when my dad & mum lived there together; he'd married a year before Donald, I think.

The ground floor continued as their surgery with an office, a waiting room, two operating rooms, a small pharmacy room, kitchen, etc. Later the upstairs was converted to two apartments; when I was a kid it was just bedrooms, I don't recall how many maybe six?.

Brian left the practice at some stage (before I was old enough to know when, maybe before I was born) and had a long career working for the government as a vet. He'd been a vet in the army looking after mules in Burma during WWII iirc. 

It wasn't until the 1990s that the veterinary practice moved out into a purpose-built building away from the town center. That happened mainly because there wasn't enough street parking for clients, but also of course to get a more modern environment.","lprsl7k"

However, the way he writes the goblins and takes you along as the other characters get to know them is masterful and deeply moving, and that is what keeps Snuff still pretty high up there.

I went to the museum a couple of years after it opened, and yes the ground floor was very much the same, though I think the back part past the operating rooms had changed into display area rather than the ancient kitchen, scullery, and pantry which were there when I was a kid. But I haven't been back for over 20 years; I'm far away in California. 

When I visited the museum the cellars were off limits; I wonder if those have been used since? There was a family funny story of Brian banishing himself to the cellar and chopping wood down there for a long time after some particular argument between him and his big brother! Possibly when Brian failed his vet exams but i forgot the details (I'm 80, with a rusty memory haha). Prior to the museum the cellars were pretty forbidding, dark and cobwebby.","lq9ltv9"
