You can find more information on the Banned Book Compendium over here: https://www.reddit.com/r/bannedbooks/comments/12f24xc/ive_made_a_digital_collection_of_32_classic/ Feel free to share that file far and wide: bonus points if you can share it with students, teachers, and librarians. :)

2.  Schools have always restricted kids. From school uniforms/dress codes, rules that delineate appropriate behavior, discipline and more. 

3. The reason the books have disproportionately affected black women is because more black women support critical theory concepts.   Nothing to do with race, everything to do with the message.  No doubt there are black female authors that don’t fit this point, but same would apply to other authors.

You can go to the local library its more a censorship discussion on what is appropriate for kids at what age then ""Book banning"". The whole use of that term reeks of aggressive ulterior motive even in a religious sense my doctrine vs yours. For books on Amazon sure / local library sure their are bannings and these should be of far more concern.   Im far  more concerned by Amazon banning books than schools.

Huck FInn , Farenheit 451 and Ulysses are reallly extreme though  
  
Many of the others contain explicit sex and sexual  violence which are not appropriate for schools just like X rated movies are not.  You could argue books should have ratings like adult themese NC17 etc.  You can prove a bias by seeing if books with diverse characters and authors of colours have higher amounts of sexual content/ how extreme and violence.  i dont think you can do that just by correlating bannings to diverse characters and authors of colours.  There will probably a correlation but probably far less than is made out and more religious areas.   
  
Picture of Dorian Gray is rarely banned despite its homo erotic over tones and author but there is no explicit sexuality. Obviously you will get into the religious debate Satanic verses and Farenheit 451 ( bible burning)  and it maybe appropriate that books  like satanic verses should not be in schools so that we are sensitive to other views  for non adults. A my religion vs yours is a devisive war that cannot be won , do you really think you can convert everyone to be non religious ?  Such divisiveness created the crusades / Jihads and now the whole anti woke war we are now seeing politically weaponised ie you create a worse version off what your trying to stop.

There is NO real medical consensus, and virtually zero high quality medical papers on this. None of the hormonal treatments are evidence based. 

I have zero problem with grown adults 18+ doing whatever they like to their bodies. At 18 if you are old enough to go to war, pay taxes, get married and vote then in my mind (unless you have a cognitive impairment issue) you can decide for yourself. 

If someone isn't old enough to get a tattoo, and isn't responsible enough to pick what political party to vote for then they are absolutely unequipped to make such a massive life changing decision.

Many given puberty blockers arent even old enough to have sex.

There are plenty of studies in animals that show severe impacts to future health outcomes when the normal hormonal changes are interfered with.

I’m sure you would agree that there are schools that have teachers pushing their beliefs on the children.  This can happen on either spectrum.  This problem comes in waves, and the current wave of insanity is the various theories derived from critical theory. These theories are a form of religion and they inoculate themselves from discourse by disparaging those that disagree. 

So maybe you like that line of philosophy but loathe religion, or vice versa. Nefarious teachers will expose your impressionable young children, and direct them to books the you do not want them exposed too at that time.  I use Elementary school as my limit.  Older children need exposure to bad ideas to become critical THINKERS, but our schools create sheep …. Not innovators. 

This is why I support the dismantling of the Department of Education. You want a  child raised on the ideals of Critical Theory and Marxism … go to the state that provides it. Want a theologian, send them to that school. Ultimate freedom.  The progressive left does not want this …. because the ultimate goal is to manipulate the mind of the child.
