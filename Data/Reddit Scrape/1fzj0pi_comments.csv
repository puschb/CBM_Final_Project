"lr1o2th","Deleted","2024-10-09 04:19:26 UTC","I 100% agree with your first point. Amy should have waited to see how her grandchildren were raised to truly understand if her kids appreciated her and their style of upbringing. Did they raise their kids in the same style? Does she even have a relationship with her adult kids?


I also think the book has more shock value than any other value. Her point about western parenting being the default is valid, but I was raised by Indian parents who did not Tiger parent, despite it being very common in the Indian community. And I'm sure a great many Asian parents don't Tiger parent either. There is no singular type of western parenting, and some western parents are tiger parents. 


OP, you mention your in highschool. I'm in my 30s and a parent to two kids. I want my kids to *want* to have a relationship with me when they are my age and to be contributing members of society, however that looks. That will be parenting success. I don't care if they are best at multiplication or not. ",""

There were three take-homes for me: 1, Chua didn't really believe much of what she was saying, she was just shit-stirring for most of it; 2, the authoritarian parenting style she describes is ineffective, and most Chinese-American parents don't use it; and 3, her children were born into an incredibly privileged environment and this had a bigger influence on their eventual life outcomes than being tiger-mommed, which given Chua's admissions of being an unreliable narrator probably didn't really happen anyway.


I gather from Chua's interviews and stated positions that she's yet another rightwing gorgon with a massive superiority complex. Never been tempted to read the book myself. ",""
"lr1r3md","Uptons_BJs","2024-10-09 04:48:50 UTC","I'm an Asian guy who graduated from a top university, and I detest tiger mom thinking. But I want to unpack it a little bit.

  
Tiger mom thinking might not be wrong, but I detest the fact that the education system has been twisted in a way that it might work. Or let me use a very, very crass analogy to hammer in the point:

  
We now know that for many years, the best way to get cast in good roles as an actress is to blow Harvey Weinstein. Thus, to adapt to this reality, acting schools should offer blowjob classes so their graduates are more successful. 

  
Do you agree with that statement? I hope not. Fuck man, the correct response to ""blow Harvey Weinstein to get good roles"" should not be ""practice your blowjob skills"" but ""make it so that you don't have to blow Harvey Weinstein to get a good role"".

  
Now let's look at the landscape of modern education. Tiger mom thinking came from China, or East Asia more broadly. It makes total sense there. I went to school in china many years ago, and students were pushed to their limits to get into a good middle school, and then get into a good high school, and then get a good gaocao score for a good university. 

  
Things were so ridiculous that I used to have a next door neighbor when I used to live in Beijing who came to my house to watch TV. Why? He cancelled his home cable and internet service so that there is absolutely no distraction in his home so his son can study harder to get a good GaoKao score. After all, the dad can't keep an eye on the son so that he doesn't slack off 24/7, so he figured that he will just eliminate the distraction from the source. 

  
Why does your GaoKao score matter so much? Well, Gaokao is like the Chinese SATs, and it is the score that determines what university you can get into. Pushing your kids to their limit to get a good Zhongkao (highschool enterance exam) and then a good Gaokao score makes total sense in China, because public education is shit. 

  
The Chinese government separates universities into 1st, 2nd, and 3rd tier (and then there's community colleges for associates degrees). Ask anyone in China, and they will tell you that 2nd and 3rd tier universities are total fucking shit. Don't waste your time, you aren't going to learn anything, and nobody gives a fuck about that piece of toilet paper you get from them. 1st tier universities are passable, but even then, only the top tier like Tsinghua and Peking University are seen to have any bit of prestige - the lower half of the 1st tier is passable at best. 

  
So in China, Tiger mom thinking where you should push your kid to the absolute limit makes sense, since there are so many students competing for so few spots at universities that are actually decent, you should push your kid as hard as they can go. 

  
In China, there is extreme competition because the reality is that there is only a tiny number of limited spots where a student can get a good education. Thus, you should push your kid as hard as they can, so they can ensure that they can get one of those spots. 

  
I absolutely detest this line of thinking when applied to the US and Canada (where the situation is a little different, but let's break it down a bit further). 

  
In my opinion, as a working person who pays a lot of taxes - it is absolutely unacceptable that a good public university system does not have enough spots for every eligible student. Whether it is the University of Toronto, where I graduated from, or say, the University of California system, or SUNY system, or whatever, it is my belief that a public university system should have sufficient spots of quality education for every kid that qualifies. 

  
For example - If the ministry of higher education says that every kid who scores a B average or above in high school should be sufficient who get into a good university to get a good education, then they should ensure that there are sufficient spots so that every kid who meets the criteria should be able to get a spot.

Your comments on the book are very insightful and ring true to me. I'm with you that writing the book when her children are still children doesn't give much insight into how ""successful"" her parenting was.

"lr1smyy","papa-hare","2024-10-09 05:05:21 UTC","I love your introspection and the majority of your analysis.  I wouldn't have guessed that you're still in high school! 

And to answer your question yes, children can make their own decisions and turn out just fine, I absolutely did! I was rarely the best in my class (but always hovered around there without a lot of effort), and while my family appreciated it, nobody cared that much about my grades. I left my country and came to study in the US for college (scholarships, exams etc included), again no pressure (other than what I put on myself). No practicing for 10h a day, no drilling until I got straight As (unless it was something **I** cared about, like my mom and grandma helped me drill for the geography Olympiad in 8th grade, but again no pressure except for my own).

That being said, I am sure this depends from child to child. Children absolutely can end up poorly if everything is a choice. You do have to strike the perfect balance, but that's something you as a parent do by observing your kid, not from a book imo.

Then again, while I'm an adult, I don't have kids so I should probably defer to people who do. But then again people who do might just disagree with the way I was raised, or the opposite, think any child would do well being raised like I did. And I don't think either are true.

I have to say though, having your parents trust you and treat you like a human being is great! I've had friends who weren't and it was always puzzling and frustrating even for me!",""
"lr2vm6t","LordAcorn","2024-10-09 12:11:16 UTC",">Why do Westerners get to define ""default"" parenting and Asian parenting is the deviation?


Traditional ""western"" parenting is actually pretty close to traditional ""Asian"" parenting where you pressure or just outright beat your children into obedience. However research into early childhood psychology clearly shows how damaging that style of parenting is and so people eventually adopted a more gentle style. 


So this isn't really an Eastern vs Western dichotomy so much as a science vs traditional dichotomy. ",""

"lr2z2xv","spanchor","2024-10-09 12:37:12 UTC","I’m Korean-American and late Gen X. I haven’t read the book and don’t want to, but I’ll respond to a couple key points you raised on their own terms.

—

First, yes, there is a global issue with liberal Western values, or more accurately the Westerners who identify with them, being held up as the most advanced or enlightened or culturally superior.

The perfect example for Koreans is the cultural practice of eating dog meat. For maaaaany Westerners if you eat dog you might as well be a Nazi, and I don’t think that’s a massive exaggeration. (Nor would I be surprised to see this comment downvoted just because I’m raising the topic.) Now, I have never and will never eat dog, and I do think the dog farming practices were cruel. But: no more cruel than what modern factory farming does to cows or pigs. Yes, human beings have a special historical relationship with dogs. And yet: they’re still just mammals like other mammals that Westerners eat more of pound for pound than anyone else on the planet (because they can afford it).

I won’t even touch human and civil rights issues, except to say that a global ascendancy of Africa and developing parts of Asia is on its way, and unless Western values become magically more persuasive real fast, the first world is in for a rude awakening.

—

Second, I suspect there’s a better balance to be found on both ends, in both Western and Asian cultures, with regard to valuing education and success vs. pursuit of interests and self-fulfillment.

Korean kids (in Korea) are pushed waayyy too hard, have zero life or time for themselves, burn out, fall apart, and it’s all reinforced by a culture that only understands one very narrow version of success (go to a SKY school and then work for Samsung or whatever).

Meanwhile in the US, I’ve also seen incredibly intelligent and capable kids (peers and kids of peers) who were raised with the best of Western values and ended up doing frankly very little with themselves. And maybe that’s okay, if they’re reasonably happy. But I personally believe we can all recognize a kind of loss or sadness in people who have more to offer, know it, but never put that to good use.

—

For my own part: My parents pushed me pretty hard, I went to an Ivy League school, have done fine as an adult, am married and own a home and live a pretty comfortable life in New York City. At the same time I’m less financially and professionally successful than *most* of my college-era friends (the capitalists anyway), and quite a few people I went to high school with who did not excel in school by any measure.

On the one hand, I can certainly attribute some of the success I’ve had to my parents. On the other hand, I am confronted every single day with stuff I still suck at that holds me back, imo because of three main factors:

1) I never learned about the real world: core life skills, possible career paths, money and finances, that kind of thing. My parents were quite naive and never knew much or taught me anything about that stuff. Mild example, I could read well before other kids, but I was last to learn how to count money or tell time.

2) I never found much intrinsic motivation. There was always someone yelling at me to do my homework and I nearly got into real trouble in college once that external force wasn’t there. It’s still a problem.

3) I never developed certain interpersonal skills. Parents were strict about social stuff and friends and even discounted a lot of extracurriculars, which I had to fight for. Nor did they value social relationships in their own lives, which really bit them in the ass as they aged.

My parents’ mental model of the world was: Do well in school and you’ll succeed in life. Which is fine as far as it goes.

But the hidden assumption inside that model was: People in authority will recognize and reward you for doing what you’re told and doing it well. Which is flat out fucking false.

You *must* be able to advocate for yourself, find and pursue opportunities, know how to deal with people—aka understand how the real world works, build intrinsic motivation, and develop social/interpersonal skills.

I've reflected on it even more as an adult since I've read a lot more literature and sociological research by Asian Americans and have come to dislike the book and the author even more. Amy Chua's parenting style is hardly even representative of ""Asian"" parenting because she herself was born in America and pretty much invented her own extreme style of parenting and she goes and markets it as ""traditional"" Chinese or Asian parenting and intentionally stirs up all this controversy. That only worsens stereotypes against Asians as inhumanly competent, emotionally cold, and un-American - i.e. the model minority stereotype. Which is NOT a good thing no matter how much it seems like a ""positive"" stereotype!

Amy Chua also has a track record of stoking cultural/racial conflicts for the sake of conservative causes, basically claiming that Asian and White Americans are well-off because they just raise their kids better and have better ""values"" while ignoring all the historical and structural reasons for racial inequities. She and her husband wrote a whole book on this argument even though they're just lawyers with no expertise in history or sociology, and experts in those fields have thoroughly debunked their claims.

"lr1sxj3","Uptons_BJs","2024-10-09 05:08:41 UTC","Broadly speaking, in Ontario where I live, this is true. As much as we UofT people love to mock people who go to say, York (""if you can use a fork, you can go to york!"") or Brock (""if you can walk and talk, you can go to Brock!""), less prestigious universities like York and Brock are still totally capable of education students with a quality education.

Based on my understanding of the data, the same applies to most US states. Like, SUNY's campuses can all offer a decent quality of education and teaches kids properly. Same with say, Ohio State, University of California systems, etc, etc.

Let me make something VERY EXPLICITLY CLEAR here: In an era of mass PhD overproduction, actually teaching undergraduate course content is a trivial concern. Any university with a job opening will have hundreds of quality applicants applying. Teaching kids is not the hard part, the achievement gap between ""shitty schools"" and ""prestigious schools"" can almost completely be explained by the fact that ""prestigious schools"" attract all the smart hard working kids, while ""shitty schools"" end up with less motivated students who didn't do so well in high school. In fact, when you look at professional certification exams with objective criteria (bar exams, CPA, engineering licensing, etc), often times ""shitty schools"" show very well there.

So why are students and their parents so insistent on going to ""the prestigious school"" then? Well, back when I was a student, it was because of two reasons:

* A) we wanted to be seen as a hero, to get bragging rights - I graduated from the toughest university!
* B) for better job prospects

And if you are in the United States where there are high quality private schools like Harvard and Yale, there's a third reason:

* C) It's where rich kids (legacy admits) get to mingle with smart kids - Good for networking and entrepreneurship

To me, reasons A and C represent a twisting of the purpose of education, and B can be easily remedied.

First of all, regarding reason A), I believe that it is not the purpose of higher education to create a new class of nobility or to give people bragging rights. It is to create a educated populace so that society can function. UofT students endlessly bragged about how ""our school was so tough, so I'm a tough guy"" is completely missing the point of public higher education - The fact that UofT fails so many students to keep up their ""tough"" image is a policy failure. It is shameful that the university with the highest admission average across all majors has such high attrition rates. The school is internationally squandering the potential of bright young people to keep up its reputation for being tough and its prestige.

Now A) feeds into B) - Employers prefer recruiting from ""prestigious"" ""tough"" schools, so smart kids want to go to these ""prestigious"", ""tough"" schools. And I think it is a massive government failure that they aren't trying to improve employment prospects at ""lesser"" schools.

For example - imagine if the data shows (pulling this out of my ass now, its late and I don't want to go dig up the real numbers), ""UofT graduates are 10% more likely to be employed, and have a starting salary $7000 higher than York graduates"" (or fill in your local schools, IE: ""Columbia graduates are 10% more likely to be employed, and have a starting salary $7000 higher than SUNY graduates""), then it is my belief that the ministry should be looking to reduce those disparities.

Honestly, it isn't even that hard, maybe give companies a tax incentive to go to recruiting events at second tier schools or whatever, and you can eliminate much of the disparity.

As for C), well, that's just because the government ""plays too fair"" against private schools. Imagine if say, New York offered the banks a $3000 tax break to hire a SUNY grad instead of a Columbia grad - Boom, all the smart kids would go to SUNY and Columbia would lose its luster.

I went on this long rant to say that - Today in the education system, people still think of getting into a good university as a ""ticket to the nobility"". It doesn't have to be like that, in education systems where everyone can get a quality education, it is a policy failure on behalf of the ministry that this disparity still exists.

But because this disparity exists, it makes sense for moms to push their kids as hard as they can - Get into the top university, and you get better life outcomes. But this is a policy failure that IMO shouldn't even exist!

  
Tiger mom thinking exists because there is such a disparity in outcomes between top universities and the rest. And yet, in the modern academic environment, it doesn't have to be that way. The fact that these disparities still exist is to me, a massive policy failure.","lr1r3md"

I had loads of free time to apportion as I saw fit, picked all my own activities, and decided myself without any discussion with my parents what schools I would apply to and then eventually attend.  


Neither of my parents were raised in the US, but both of them encouraged me from very young to argue against them for my viewpoint with reasoned arguments and if I made a good argument they'd actually change their mind.

No holistic admissions process, no personal statements, no interviews. The test scores in your province are sorted from top to bottom and your province (or province equivalent's) admissions slots are allocated accordingly. My wife went through the process and was able to qualify for admission to basically any university in the country besides Peking or Tsinghua. This required her to score in the top 250 or so test takers in her whole province of some 58,000,000 people. At this level of competition, a question or two can have an immense effect on your options for higher education.

This probably has something to do with why Asian parents in the US end up spending disproportionate effort on bolstering parts of their kids' resumes that have a fairly small effect (e.g. weeks of SAT prep to get your  kid from a 1550 to a 1570 will do little to nothing for acceptance chances at Harvard, they're still getting an Academic 2 rating and literally nothing done in school will get them to a 1).","lr1sxj3"

I just wanna expand on this a little bit- I don't think that public education in China is exactly terrible in general but the number of decent (or what is considered as decent) high schools are limited especially when the population is so big. You are right that there are major disparities especially between urban and rural areas. 

From my extended family's current experiences in China, if you couldn't get into what is considered as a ""good"" public high school you have to send your kids to private school which costs money. However, private school costs do vary greatly by city. 

I also agree that this is a massive policy failure across the boards. I remember reading from somewhere about schools in rural areas in China being closed and consolidated with schools in more densely populated areas.

Some may only be interested in specific subjects, while others have bad predisposition to schooling or issues like test anxiety. When it comes to parenting, most Asian parents have a hard time relating to their children's struggles and their children likely aren't able to communicate why they aren't able to live up to expectations. Even personally, I probably didn't realize these issues until I finished undergraduate studies. That being said, this really hit home for me:

> Things were so ridiculous that I used to have a next door neighbor when I used to live in Beijing who came to my house to watch TV.

If we take this thinking and apply to something like sports, imagine your parents forcing you to attend sports school for 6 hours a day, then forcing you to train 8 hours a day at 80%+ effort with no distractions. The obvious result would be burnout and injury from overexertion, and no athlete trains like this knowing today's sports science. Not to mention the constant mental pressure from such expectations. A normal kid can only handle so much, and given that the tiger mom agenda robs them of their adolescent years, it usually backfires immediately once the child is no longer under parental supervision.

While tiger mom thinking is for a goal that is supposed to set you up for long term success, it's more like fake finish line at the top of a giant moutainside that doesn't do much but waste your time trying to get there.","lr1sxj3"

I've long held that ""an education is what you make of it"" as an argument why prestige and price doesn't matter. Usually I'm specifically arguing against the notion that private schools are somehow inherently better schools, but often pointing out that academic prowess is defined more by a person's ability to intake new information, reindex or reclassify old information, and draw relevant conclusions; not by arbitrary metrics such as ""I can solve diffeqs in my head"" and ""I can recite Hamlet from memory"" - two near useless abilities due to their limited potential applications outside of academics.

You make an excellent point of that with regards to the showing in professional certifications - reasonably smart and/or motivated people are going to seek out the knowledge they need to be successful, regardless of where they receive their laminated place setting. Yes, students of those ""top tier schools may have more comprehensive courses, or the courses may cram more into the students' skulls, or they may just provide more knowledge available within arm's length. However, that knowledge is always available to anyone who is willing to seek it out - they may simply need to take additional steps to acquire it.","lr1sxj3"

Secondly, China’s education system is very unequal and top heavy. There is this general perception that second and third tier universities are utter trash.

"lr4jfbj","superturtle48","2024-10-09 17:57:12 UTC","Gonna pull out some of the stuff I've read because I literally read research for a living and I'm not just going off of hunches. First, the very academically-oriented parental expectations of many Asian immigrant parents are not exactly because they're *Asian*, but because many of them were very highly educated and professional in their home countries and expect the same of their kids. Selective immigration policies mean that Asian immigrants are disproportionately more educated than the general populations of both the sending (Asian) countries AND the receiving countries (e.g. America). If you look at the populations of most Asian countries, a much smaller proportion of them have higher education compared to the corresponding Asian diaspora. In ""ancient times,"" an even smaller portion of the population had a shot at going to school or working in civil service and there was hardly any social mobility. So it's a very small segment of ""Asian culture"" that people think of when they assume that Asians all value education and studying hard and all that, as if a very small segment of American society like Silicon Valley represented all of America. The sociological book [The Asian American Achievement Paradox] (https://www.russellsage.org/asian-american-achievement-paradox) does a great job breaking this all down. And that's just regarding general high academic expectations of Asian immigrant parents, not even Amy Chua's particularly radical parenting where she threatens her kids and makes them cry and all.

Second, parenting at least in China where my family and Amy Chua's are from has changed in recent decades to become less disciplinarian than it used to be. When the book was released in China, it was actually renamed ""Mothering in the United States"" and Chinese readers thought Chua's parenting was ridiculous because it was extreme even to them. In fact, I've heard of many Chinese people thinking that Chinese kids today are too spoiled and coddled, in part due to the former one-child policy resulting in parents pouring much more time and effort into their child's development than in the past. Also in East Asia where populations are declining and economies are slowing down, people are starting to doubt the value of a college education when they see so many graduates not able to get a job. Some stats and research on that in this article: https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008749

All to say, I think a lot of Asians and non-Asians alike - including Amy Chua - have a very rigid and static view of what ""Asian"" culture and parenting are, when in reality Asians and Asian Americans are incredibly varied in their practices and those practices are constantly shifting in response to societal pressures and trends.","lr4da8i"

As you infer, ""Asian"" is not monolithic; even if you go with simply the old nations' seperation, each nation' develop differently in modern times, not to say very different approach in their history. So for others reading this, be aware that just because Mainlanders, Taiwanese, and Hong Kongers each have their own way of thinking AND history, not to mention those that came from Korea and Japan.


And one thing that is in the back in my mind is: Why do we (or our parents) come over? As a Hong Konger I can answer very easily: believe in Freedom and distrust of overcontrolling government. But what about the others? Maybe they just have one aspect (eg: Taiwanese of my generation: conscription). Or really dislike the culture there. That will also change what they consider to be proper Asian.



There are 2 issues, both could be related
1) Many Asian countries does prosper; sometimes providing cleaniness and and societal order that the Western nations can only be jealous of. What causes it? Maybe education, maybe other, maybe their own culture and habits, etc. Every nation, unfortunately, will construct a myth.

2) I suspect Amy Chau's is her way to find the roots. What she try to do, is no different than many local borns or adopted babies who observe or even travel back to the old countries, or hear stories from their parents, etc. But sometimes stories and culture got mixed. I would not be surprise when Vancouverites think ""Chinese"", what they are seeing are ""Hong Kongers who come over during the 90s who experience propsperity during the 80s"" Or maybe from Singapore, which is also draconian in their education. Both of which, as you point out, likely favor that 


At the end of the day, I am not going dismiss tiger mother as a mere caricature or not Asia-asian - Asian parenting is well known both in Asia and outside, even before Amy Chau write it down. Better to admit it's a bad part of culture that was leaked out.","lr4jfbj"

Worse. From the article:

>Student reacted with surprise, and quickly pointed out that Chua’s own daughter was due to clerk for Kavanaugh.

>A source said that Chua quickly responded, saying that **her own daughter would not put up with any inappropriate behaviour**. \\[my emphasis\\]

Let's parse that statement again: Chua (who publicly endorsed Kavanaugh as a ""mentor for women"") allegedly decided that Kavanaugh's ""inappropriate behaviour"" wouldn't be a problem for her daughter, because her daughter ""would not put up"" with it. Does that mean that, according to Chua, a woman can only be a victim of ""inappropriate behaviour"" (aka sexual harassment) if she ""puts up"" with it?

 Oftentimes what you're seeing in asian-american families of specific backgrounds is a filtering effect - only educated immigrants were allowed into the US in the first place and so they emphasize education in their own children because they themselves were educated and that was their own pathway to what they saw as a better life (you don't go through the very difficult  process of emigration because you're having a swell time at home, generally). But this effect is much less pronounced where that filtering process wasn't based in educational and professional potential for the American setting.


 Like you see Cambodian-american populations struggle a lot more in educational achievement and especially income compared to other national origins from asia because the original population wasn't pre-selected by the immigration process for educational and professional capability - it was a more humanitarian-focused process.   That's part of why I think the whole 'asian' label is quite unhelpful, the specific national origins vary quite widely in the original filtering process, home culture, background, and eventual income outcomes once in the US","lr4b87m"

Of course, if she doesn't put up with it, that means that Chua assumes it will happen, because otherwise there would be nothing to put up with or not put up with. So, what does not putting up with it mean, exactly? I suspect her idea of not putting up with it is very different from mine. I suspect that she thinks women in that position have to shut up about it and try to ignore it, or use it in some way. 

That is what her advice to women who want to clerk for Kavanaugh really means, right? Look attractive and try to appeal to his taste in women, and he will give you a job. 

That is what I meant by the unspoken rules. Those rules that say that you have to do everything perfectly, and if anything terrible happens, it is because you were somehow asking for it, or because you were putting up with it. 

I was sexually assaulted several years ago, and a woman I have known for years found out about it through gossip.
