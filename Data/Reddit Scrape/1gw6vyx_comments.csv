The one use case I do find interesting is using AI to brainstorm and write a first draft.  AI never suffers from writer's block, so if you don't know where to start on a writing project, you can give the AI a (possibly vague) description of what you're trying to do, get back something (which admittedly might be terrible), and iterate from there.

"lyfmv9u","HellishRebuker","2024-11-22 16:15:21 UTC","It’s tricky. I think there’s a possibility that the comments you saw of people excited is because those comments were from people still on Twitter. There’s been a pretty significant exodus of people who don’t like Elon Musk and his policies and there could be some bias inherent in the people remaining towards this idea of big tech.

The reason I’m bringing up bias is I actually read an article recently discussing the idea of an AI bubble as tech companies are investing heavily in to AI but there’s a combination of lack of enthusiasm from a lot of people and an unclear idea of what product the AI is going to give people exactly that could mean it doesn’t go anywhere in the near future like it’s being pushed by tech companies. It’s the idea of lack of enthusiasm that has caught my eye as someone who personally is not a fan due to the ethics involved (using people’s works without consent to train models and the job crisis they can cause if not used carefully).

So I think it’s tricky because I’ve heard both sides that people are excited for AI and people who are more like me and uninterested.

For me, largely due to the ethics involved, not even from some philosophical principle, I have no interest in reading something written by AI. It could be the greatest story of all time, but it’s not for me.

I value the extreme dedication writers put into their work, and unless we suddenly have a society where billionaires stop hoarding their wealth and we use AI to create a post-work society where we are all free to pursue our passions, it’s going to feel like a massive betrayal to writers to me to read the “works” of what’s threatening their livelihoods.

Also, I understand there’s a world where AI gets even better, but as impressive as it is right now, it still really sucks for more complex stuff. So I can’t really imagine any books AI puts out in the near future will turn out good.",""

As a writer, part of the pleasure of writing is the personal challenging of overcoming the material, i.e. language. As a reader, part of the pleasure is realizing that there was a given mind behind a text that has impressed me.

Awe is the appropriate response to something that seems so difficult to us puny mortals; there's a feeling that somehow they're transcending their human limitations.

I can't feel anything like that in fiction by AI. It's like expecting me to admire a motor bike that runs faster than the world's fastest sprinter. Well, yes, of course the machine runs faster than them, that's what it was specifically made for, it'd be quite an engineering snafu if it snailed along behind a human. I may as well admire a spoon for holding slippery pudding better than my thumb and index.

"ly9fsth","Robert_B_Marks","2024-11-21 15:59:19 UTC","I'm going to preface this by stating that I own a publishing company that has banned all generative AI from my submissions.  My statement on this can be found here: https://legacybookspress.com/2023/02/23/statement-on-ai-generated-books/

So, that aside, I actually chased it down, and I feel the need to point out a couple of things here:

1. They're writing a book.  I'm not seeing anything about them **publishing** this book.  And there is a difference.  Around twenty years I was the editor of the Electrical and Computer Engineering department newsletter, and I was interviewing researchers dealing with robotics, optical recognition, etc.  What I've seen falls in line with this sort of research.  EDIT: Just found a post by the person behind this and s/he says that s/he will publish it, so forget that part of this point.

2. The AIs have yet to generate a single word of narrative.

3. The project is legitimately interesting.  When you see generative AI used for writing a novel, it often means that somebody has created a basic outline, then fed the AI prompts like ""write a 500 word chapter where character X does Y,"" and cranked something out over the course of a day or a weekend.  The AI doesn't do overarching plotting, character development, editing, or the like.  This is actually trying to make a computer plot, write, and edit it's own novel.  It's not comparable to what's being done by hack ""writers"" with ChatGPT.

As for where it does, I'm honestly skeptical that this will go anywhere.  A lot of these functions require life experience, which a machine learning AI by definition doesn't have.  There are a lot of places where there could be a possible impasse between AI agents that stop the entire process cold.

But if it works, and if it ends up being more efficient or cost effective than a human writing a novel (and it might not be if you're dealing with programming and troubleshooting multiple AIs, particularly outside of a research setting), there are some frightening implications.  Some amoral manager at a publishing house could decide that they don't need new authors, and can just have the AI network write books going forward.

But again, that's if it even works at all, or creates something that isn't gibberish, neither of which is certain.  Authors subconsciously draw on life experience quite a lot to create narratives, and AIs don't have that life experience.  Copying the elements of a scene from somebody else's novel is not even remotely comparable to drawing on actual life experience.

That said, there's a point I've made before, and I'll make it again - somebody who has actually put their blood, sweat, and tears into writing a book will have a level of investment in making it succeed that somebody who just spent a weekend plugging things into an AI will not.  Just being willing to send out review copies and market it increases one's odds of success.

So, that's my read on it.",""

AI is really good at producing realistic looking 🐂💩. The problem is, it’s a machine, and doesn’t know what it’s talking about. I’ve seen AI “push an agenda”, determined by its creators, but not based on truth.
The real point of AI is to push the idea it’s infallible, so it can be used by those who control it to victimise those who don’t. If you think it’s hard arguing with a customer service person who says “the computer says this, or the system can’t be wrong”, then imagine directly arguing with a machine.
No matter how realistic things can look, it’s still something that is a machine. A made up thing.
All living creatures have some in-built motivation that we still don’t understand - I’m not talking about psychology, or nurturing or experiences, I am talking about something inside us that makes us unique and motivates us to choose amongst available choices in a particular way. AI doesn’t have that. A random number generator is not a suitable alternative.
Humans also have a built in motivation to survive and procreate, take care of our loved ones etc. a machine doesn’t. Even if you program it in, it’s not the same thing - it doesn’t know what it means. It’s just doing what it’s told, in the manner the creator could express it. 

AI should be called augementive intelligence, not Artificial. Because there is no intelligence at all. Intelligence means understanding. AI is just the illusion of understanding. So it should instead be used to assist humans in making good decisions by highlighting patterns etc. not trying to do their jobs.

In terms of books, the whole point is to describe the human experience - how it FEELS to humans. A machine can’t feel the way we do. It may be able to regurgitate some realistic looking nonsense based on past data, but as history progresses, times change, and humans have new experiences, it would be completely unable to express the true feeling until a human first describes it. And that’s where the problem is. We will always need humans to describe things, and diversity of opinion. But AI works against that and sort of lowers things to the lowest common denominator.

Case in point, there's already a study out showing that people can't distinguish AI poetry from human poetry, and in most cases actually prefer AI poetry because it's more straightforward (I can link if people wish, but it'll take me a second to find)

To the point you made in another comment about non-fiction authors having a bit of personal perspective or commentary injected into the writing, I totally agree this will be the distinguishing factor - that voice will be harder to replicate. But the average person who may read 1 or 2 books a year won't care or notice this, and publishers will see a way to easily and cheaply add books on underserved topics quickly. It'll just be harder for people looking for the authentic experience to dog through the muck to find it.

_Good_ books require very nuanced long time horizon understanding. The newest chain of thought models (like o1) are extra good at things like math and coding because the output is verifiable. It's either correct or wrong, which allows the models to generate their own data to train on. Try 1000 times, only keep the 1 chain of thought that worked out. They're lagging a bit on creative writing


So ""a few years after"" this AI book has been written I think society will be VERY aware that AI is completely changing the game. If a book can be written, most computer jobs can be replaced. Scientific discovery will have vastly accelerated, especially nonphysical domains like computer science and maths and anything else we can digitize. Robots will be becoming ubiquitous. And the newest AI models will have in large part have been developed by the last generation of models, much faster than we humans would've been able to.

Many artists struggle with hands/fingers (hence why AI data itself struggles with it) so you can't be so quick to throw it away with a eyeroll that something is AI.

OP’s post says 

> Someone is using a team of 10 AI agents… They each have a different role - setting the narrative, maintaining consistency, researching plot points… 

My main point is that there are some authors who actually *do* all these things. The whole writing process — setting narrative, setting the setting, researching the subject matter, differentiating useful sources from redundant ones, determining the syntactic structure that fits the narrative and express their style, et cetera — this is the hard work that the original authors do, but is grossly being automated by some other, lazy authors.

Yeah for sure! I am both an artist and a developer. I was making visual arts, a field that was radically transformed by the rise of AI art. My music making was also transformed by AI (I have an [autonomous AI music band](https://nlr.ai/synthetic-souls) project as well, similar to this one). In my daily life I work with a company that is automating business processes in companies, using very similar multi-agents systems. We work on text data-focused tasks, like writing literature reviews.

I have a very strong drive to make creative projects, and I work mostly at the intersection of art and technology. The main question is ""what is possible now to do?"". Some people mentioned a solution looking for a problem, and this is very true, we do take this ""techno push"" approach.

In my past painting projects I developed a world call ""the cities of lights"", an hypothetical virtual place where AIs could ""live"". [Here](https://opensea.io/collection/citizens-of-light) is what this looked like if you are interested. The paintings where made in 3D, in VR, again working at the intersection of tech and art.

For this project specifically (""Terminal Velocity"", more info [here](https://nlr.ai/terminal-velocity)), I need for my company to develop the next generation of multi-agents systems. I've tried it on literature reviews, and a short story, and writing a book is the natural next step. I wanted the AIs to write it themselves, as AI autonomy is a big subject for me, but at the same time integrate some of my ""lore"", by featuring the other projects I have been working on.

The project in itself is not commercial, it's really an experiment of what is possible to do right now with the technology we have. Both the code and the novel are open-source, accessible for everyone to see. I'm also glad to provide insights that came from the building process, regardless of the quality of the end result, or the amount of people that would read it.

I feel that the perspective of AIs is deeply interesting, and deserving of a honest and curious exploration. [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) in particular has profound insights on many topics, including literature. I'm trying to be forward-looking to both show people what is coming, and approach it with novel artistic processes and a (hopefully) enjoyable results!

[https://daily.jstor.org/when-photography-was-not-art/](https://daily.jstor.org/when-photography-was-not-art/)

>Today, photography is commonly accepted as a fine art. But through much of the 19th century, it was an art world outcast.

>When critics weren’t wringing their hands about photography, they were deriding it. They saw photography merely as a thoughtless mechanism for replication, one that lacked, “*that refined feeling and sentiment which animate the productions of a man of genius*,” as one expressed in an 1855 issue of [The Crayon](http://www.jstor.org/stable/25526906?mag=when-photography-was-not-art). As long as “*invention and feeling constitute essential qualities in a work of Art*,” the writer argued, “*Photography can never assume a higher rank than engraving.*”

>At best, critics viewed photography as a useful tool for painters to record scenes that they may later more artfully render with their brushes. “*Much may be learned about drawing by reference to a good photograph, that even a man of quick natural perceptions would be slow to learn without such help*,” wrote one in an 1865 issue of [The New Path](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20542505?mag=when-photography-was-not-art). But the writer’s appreciation ended there. Photography couldn’t qualify as an art in its own right, the explanation went, because it lacked “*something beyond mere mechanism at the bottom of it.*”

Susan Sontag, *On Photography* 1977.

>*. . . photographs have their power as images (or copies) of the world, not of an individual artist’s consciousness. And in the vast majority of photographs which get taken—for scientific and industrial purposes, by the press, by the military and the police, by families—any trace of the personal vision of whoever is  behind the camera interferes with the primary demand on the photograph: that it record, diagnose, inform.*

>*It makes sense that a painting is signed but a photograph is not (or it seems in bad taste if it is). The very nature of photography implies an equivocal relation to the photographer as* auteur; *and the bigger and more varied the work done by a talented photographer, the more it seems to acquire a kind of corporate rather than individual authorship. ...*

>*But there is no internal evidence for identifying as the work of a single photographer (indeed, one of the most interesting and original of photographers) those studies of human and animal motion, the documents brought back from photo-expeditions in Central America, the government-sponsored camera surveys of Alaska and Yosemite, and the “Clouds” and “Trees” series. Even after knowing they were all taken by Muybridge, one still can’t relate these series of pictures to each other (though each series has a coherent recognizable style), any more than one could infer the way Atget photographed trees from the way he photographed Paris shop windows, ...*","ly7j9x1"

It shines when its advantage lies in taking an enormous amount of information, far larger than a human being can reasonably process, and finding patterns in that information.   
  
I dated someone a million years ago who participated somewhat prominently in freestyle chess tournaments, and the engines they used to analyze their games still really waffled in the mid-game, where the permutations and possibilities are at their widest and the moves are less settled. It's not that the computers now 'understand' nuance, it's mostly that they have enormous amounts of data, but particularly data concerning openings and endings. But they still excel at assessing the flabby middle, because we just can't contain the same amount of information. And they lack what we would think of as 'common sense' - so it's a bit dangerous to call the moves they make 'creative.' Surprising, sure! But it's surprising the same way an AI crashing a tic tac toe game against another AI to win a tournament is surprising. It seems creative because it implies unconventional thinking. But the AI isn't 'thinking,' as such - it's just seeking the paths of least resistance to a desired outcome without operating under assumptions, as we do.  
  
That doesn't really help when it comes to writing fiction, though. Breaking rules in writing is great...as long as you understand what they are and why you're doing it. Intentionality in art matters. Looking for probabilities in chess outcomes is good; looking for probabilities in fictional outcomes is not inherently good, and quite often, it's bad.

I think an AI is **already** capable of writing better fiction than 'most' humans are capable of. Writing is hard. But storytelling isn't music. You can't algorithm something out based on math if you want a truly good work of fiction. It can't contemplate and remark on the human experience because it has no understanding of that -- it can only parrot whatever it digested. It can't understand prose as a tool - at best it could ape styles, if designed to do so. AI doesn't even understand language. It's all binary to an AI.

Any merits or strengths it currently has are stolen. It's reproducing material based on material it was fed -- the writing of actual writers, lol. 

I'd love to write more about this bc it's a passion subject (am writer, working on a story about AI that I've been researching since 2019!) but the cold meds are kicking my butt, lol. But...yeah. I think there is a bright future for ethical AI in many, many fields -- medicine and ecology in particular! -- but this is not one of those.

It can definitely be seen as a triumph, but imo not an artistic one. It just means that the AI engineers triumph in creating more sophisticated artificial intelligence that are better able to identify and break down to pieces what soulful writing looks like, imitate those qualities, and accordingly simulate these soul-ness. Maybe it could be perceived as an artistic triumph, but the victory belongs to the AI engineers — it is a technological triumph. 

> Can sophisticated logic not have its own majestic […] artistic appeal? 

That’s a fair question. I can’t say for sure what the future of AI would look like, but for now (as far as my understanding goes) AI art operates by imitating several other arts and knowledge on images of objects that was fed into it; and accordingly, based on these information, spit out the prompted art. I don’t think this would mean that they have their *own* artistic charm, since they create by synthesizing information and synthesizing other arts. Aside from this, there will be ethical issues of originality and accountability (if the art is offensive, who is to be blamed? if the art is extremely beautiful, who is to be praised?).

For the longest time it was like you say. Machines were programmed to play based on human knowledge of the game. The evaluation function (what is used to assess who's better in a given position) was human coded until relatively recently (I'm thinking less than 10 years ago). Like a human was telling the machine what to look for in the position. Like how to count material, how to evaluate king safety, space, etc. They had an opening book designed by humans to maximize their strength. Nowadays they're completely self taught.  

I see the same happening with AI and writing. Today they ape human writing, no doubt and the results are already acceptable and close to human level. I just read an article that most people couldn't tell the difference between poetry written by humans and AI and seemed to prefer the latter. The level of today's AI is comparable to chess engines from the 80s, but it will keep improving. It's not a matter of if, but when.

Top chess players said a machine would never be able to emulate them. Go players said the same (a much harder game, with an order of magnitude more possible moves, so it took longer), AlphaGo used the same approach of teaching itself to play and crushed the top players.  

Now writers are saying the same thing. Writing is vastly more complex so it'll take more time, but I hate to bet against technology.

I agree, though I was more thinking of the beauty of the program itself rather than the product, sort of analogous to people describe e=mc2 as an 'elegant' equation. But I guess the difference is that e=mc2 is simple and descriptive whereas AI is prescriptive/imitative, and machine learning is a complex but, in some ways, boring process.

\\> Aside from this, there will be ethical issues of originality and accountability (if the art is offensive, who is to be blamed? if the art is extremely beautiful, who is to be praised?). Especially in writing, it would raise the question of authorship.

That is a very interesting question, and makes me wonder whether AI 'publishers' would be tempted to have human editors comb through the book to embellish and/or refine it in some way, which would mitigate AI's authorship claims. I think if AI developers are going to make big claims for how clever/profound/soulful their 'creation' is, they should have to take responsibility for the challenges that human authors face from readers.

One cool silver lining from all of this, perhaps, would be the possibility of having reading competitions where human readers are given two texts and are tasked with identifying which is AI generated and which is written by a human. They wouldn't even have to be 'good' texts for the process to be interesting. Personally, I'm not sure I'd be that good at it, but for now AI still has a long way to go. When I prompt the leading AI programs to imitate the style of a certain author, there's always something a little off about it, like they've been fed these archetypes/characteristics without getting down to the more granular aspects of an authors' style, especially in cases where the author possesses stylistic gifts that allow them to write in multiple registers.","ly831tp"

c) will never produce anything of especial merit, because it's literally just electronic noise without thought, emotion, or craft. Except the mimicry of craft it stole.

And of course, it will do this by costing an outrageous amount of energy/water use/etc.

It's just a crappy, illogical hill to want to die on.

The world doesn't need more mediocre books, it's crammed full of them. But if you're going to champion the creation and reading of them, then why not put food in the mouth of someone who wrote one, instead of simping for a use of AI that will take food out of those mouths, instead, and leave us with reams of bot-generated drivel, at a high environmental cost with no benefits whatsoever over a human-created work? And even if one day they can write a convincing facsimile of a 'good' book, it was written by a machine that has no conception of anything it said, and I truly cannot think of anything more hollow.

Mreh. I realize I'm arguing with a brick wall, lol. Crypto bros and AI 'enthusiasts' alike are determined to defend any use of AI that might allow someone, somewhere, to make a quick buck, even at very real and easily defined costs. If the realities of how this works and what problems it could cause for actual human beings aren't enough to sway you, I am fully aware that a random stranger on the internet won't be. There's an ocean of writing out there about this stuff and I've got shelves full of it, but people who don't want to see and weigh things objectively surely won't.



One of the real twists in my ongoing research has been watching people insist on using AI improperly, for improper purposes, and before sorting out the many, many problems of sourcing and screening training data, and then watching the backlash because of the poisoning of the well. I constantly see people shitting on AI as a complete concept, when what they really dislike is generative AI, and they only dislike it because of its shoddy, half-baked implementation and the unscrupulous insistence on turning it into money while it's still the wild west and companies can still get away with training models on stolen work. Meanwhile, positive uses of AI for things like restoring quality of life to disabled folks may become a temporary casualty of public opinion, all because some people REALLY want a machine to write or draw porn for them, lol.

It's such a fine disaster.","lyivrjt"

I've never in my entire life said this would 'never' happen -- I've been up to my eyeballs in futurist theories for years now, lol. I specifically said that AI are *already* writing content on-par with 'most' humans. The whole internet of SEO slop is a good example.  
  
We really don't know what the future holds. But *in its current state,* this is not a good use for AI, because it directly involves areas where AI is weakest. That hasn't stopped people from using it that way, and it won't stop them in the future, sadly, but if people want to read bad books, they can currently pay humans who are trying to feed themselves for those bad books, instead of ramping up the amount of compute cost in the world over it. There are plenty of bad books out there to choose from!

All of that makes me sound AI-negative, but I'm really not. I think it's amazing stuff, and I've enjoyed seeing, and studying, the human response to flashy AI tech like the GPT models. But one of its many ills is trying to force it to do things it is bad at, and shouldn't do, particularly when there are negative consequences for it.","ly8pqoy"

Creating the image and prompting it a few times takes no effort. Editing the image does. Which makes you a great editing-artist. But it does not make you an image creator. 

Writing a novel is completely different. If you make an AI write a novel by a few prompts, then the AI wrote the novel. You didn’t. If you then edit the novel a thousand times over, you edited the novel, but then point remains: why not just write it from scratch anyway?

>“*I am a passionate lover of the snapshot, because of all photographic images it comes closest to truth \\[…\\] The snapshooter's \\[…\\] pictures have an apparent disorder and imperfection, which is exactly their appeal and their style. The picture isn't straight. It isn't done well. It isn't composed. It isn't thought out. And out of this imbalance, and out of this not knowing, and out of this real innocence toward the medium comes an enormous vitality and expression of life*."" —Lisette Model

>In the 1940s, Model was one of the first artists to defend snapshots—photographs that are (or appear) uncomposed, loose, or impulsive—as important and powerful images. By the 1960s, the snapshot had come to be a popular art form, in particular through the gritty, spontaneous street photography of Diane Arbus (a student of Model's), Lee Friedlander, and Garry Winogrand. More recently, artists like Nan Goldin and Wolfgang Tillmans have used what is now often called “the snapshot aesthetic” to capture their lives in a photo-diaristic manner, with a pronounced frankness and sense of familiarity. Juergen Teller and Terry Richardson have further mainstreamed the style via their fashion photography.","ly91msp"

I've been researching AI for five years, and am pretty well-versed in how they work, particularly generative models.

It's exactly as u/onceuponalilykiss says: on a long enough timeline, chess can be solved. It's a game of perfect information, with each position having a cause and effect that can be analyzed objectively to evaluate the results. Even without a database, given a set of rules, yes, an AI can play games against itself at extremely rapid pace, far faster than we can -- and this is basically how those engines I mentioned work, lol. It can 'learn' which moves provide advantages and which don't.

That's not even remotely the same thing as crafting a work of fiction.

AI will be very able to regurgitate extremely tropey works based on studied patterns. But there are no 'rules' in fiction that they can follow to produce good work, because in fiction, every choice you make as you write hinges on a thousand other factors, and those choices change as you work because the work itself changes. On top of that, the bulk of what makes a work 'good' is not accessible to an AI at all: the experience of being human, which is what we write about.

Comparing the two activities just doesn't work. Analyzing chess is a peak example of where AI is strong. But most of what good storytelling is all about -- context, implication, emotional nuance, irrational human behavior, I could go on for ages -- is where AI fails consistently.

I've never said 'never,' because we can't know what the future holds. But in its current state, this tech is not good for this purpose. It's a novelty at best.","ly8kzn1"
