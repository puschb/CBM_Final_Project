But it happens very often that when the kid reaches a certain age, the adults (their parents or close relatives) would consider it ""not reading material"", wanting the kid to read ""real books"". I have seen a lot of kids just quit reading because the adults around them would discourage them, and I still hear now a lot of my friends saying that reading manga or comics ""is not reading"".

"lvjqw1f","felltwiice","2024-11-05 16:52:10 UTC","I’m not really sure how to get kids reading. We blame phones now, but back when I was young, video games were the scapegoat to destroying children. Children mostly just want to have fun, make friends and be in social groups, explore their surroundings and be inventive. I love reading but it’s usually a solitary activity. I think it’s just up to parents, to let their kid find books that look interesting to them and join them in reading. 

I think schools also hinder it a bit. Kids need to learn to read and learn comprehension and such but often given reading material they have zero interest in and I think that contributes to a general negatively towards books. I think the only reason I love reading now is I started out with Goosebumps and my mom took me to the library where I read about space and dinosaurs; I don’t remember a single book that I enjoyed as assigned reading. And I know some parents like to look down on video games, but role-playing games can feature a ton of reading as well.",""

As I’ve heard it, part of the problem is that parents aren’t reading to their children as much as previous generations did, so kids are basically learning that you only read for school, and never for pleasure.

"lvhteqz","Psittacula2","2024-11-05 08:51:18 UTC","Of course the major reasons will be:

\\* Digital sensory and “parasocial” social media is more stimulating eg kids can’t be in a room without listening to headphones if trying to study… attention spans and hyper-stimulation are not conducive to reading

\\* A lot of information can in fact be found online and no longer exclusively in books eg Wikipedia is in many ways a massive upgrade on Encylopedias etc.

\\* Video content can be a lot more engaging than text content for senses but easier to access eg travel vids on youtube

\\* If parenting quality is low eg not structured or neglectful then lowest effort activities will dominate eg smart phone scrolling.

However I would also add a neglected area worth adding and thinking about seriously:

\\* Schools make sitting down in class doing useless academic information passive intake day after day for kids probably puts kids off reading. Some of the inane teaching (for 4 marks explain this sentence) sort of attempts to boost grades will leach the enjoyment out of reading…",""

We went weekly and checked out tons of books. Starting in infancy, they were read to daily. Little did I know how beneficial that would prove to be to their developing minds! They were marinated in language and learned to read from a very young age. As a result, school was rather easy for them. I was a chaperone during one of their elementary school field trips and a teacher asked me what my secret was for encouraging literacy/reading. I told her it was just part of my kids’ lives - books were everywhere in our home. This was also the early internet era so there weren’t any electronic distractions.

Then I got to watch Nickalodean for an hour and then I had to read for an hour until dinner time. Then after dinner it was homework, playing outside or video games and then reading before bed. 

Outside of school I read for about 2.5 hours every day unless there was something going on. It's why I loved reading. They also got me a library card, bought me books I wanted and were active in my day to day. 

That last part probably has a lot to do with a drop off on reading. They knew what I was doing, what games I was playing, what I was watching on TV, etc. 

My friends with kids aren't as involved in those aspects. I wouldn't have read for pleasure if I wasn't forced to read in the beginning.

I remember in 4th grade her giving me Misery, The Shining, The Long Walk, every Harry Potter that had been written, Congo, The Andromeda Strain. I read then all.

I frequently try to encourage them to read and I do not pressure them to do so. I gift them all sorts of books and I always tell them it’s okay if they don’t like them but if they do happen to like any books I have gotten them I frequently tell them I will buy more if they tell me which ones they like. 

I usually get them the first book to different series so they can have variety and maybe find a series they really love. I don’t think they’ve ever finished a single book I’ve ever given them or even opened them at all. I hide money in the pages of the books I give them and whenever I go visit I check their bookshelf and I open books I’ve given them only to find all the money still right where I left it every time. 

I always check to make sure the books are age appropriate before I buy them and I always encourage them to at least try them. They never do and recently they told me reading sucks and reading was boring or stupid but when I asked why they thought that they didn’t have an answer for me it’s like they were repeating something they had heard from someone else or maybe YouTube.

I’ve gotten them; Ralph S Mouse, Magic Treehouse regular and graphic novels, Redwall, Guardians of Gahoole, Warrior cats regular and the graphic novel, dogman, dairy of a wimpy kid, wings of fire regular and the graphic novel, Fablehaven, Tunnels, The Buccaneers, Artemis fowl regular and graphic novel, percy Jackson regular and graphic novel, the Indian and the cupboard, various kids science and history books, Wolves of the beyond, Gregor the overlander, Narnia box set, and more. All of them sit gathering dust on a shelf in the corner of their room.

They would rather play on their iPads and watch YouTube shorts. I cannot even get them to watch a full length movie because they don’t have the attention span to watch more than a few minutes of it without asking me when it’s going to end and they can have their iPads back. They get bored of listening to audiobooks on car rides and they want their iPads instead. They have a Nintendo switch and they don’t use it because “it gets boring too fast.” 

I will no longer be buying them any books because I know they won’t read them. I even saw the wild robot book set and I nearly got it for them but I remembered they haven’t touched a single book I’ve ever given them and it would be a waste of my money buying them books.

Even a third of children enjoying to read sounds quite high to me, let alone two-thirds. And honestly such huge drops in only a year just don't make sense.

To take that 8-18 age group this article mentions, these kids are frequently prevented from picking out the books they want by their parents. Their parents decide that they have to read certain kinds of books and disallow others (like disallowing graphics, ""easy"" chapter books, etc. And content is a huge part of this, especially for pre-teens and teens. Parents get very antsy about what their kids are reading - I've seen plenty of parents who don't let their 13, 14 even 15 year old go to the teen section. The reality is that these kids, as we all know, are being exposed to this content in other ways, often with parents not caring at all, but for some reason, these parents treat literature differently.

2) Reading Level Scores. I'm not a teacher, so I won't pretend to have a lot of knowledge about reading pedagogy. But I don't see any kid who benefits from these systems. Whether Lexile, AR, iReady or some other system, these do not benefit parents or kids, they benefit school systems. But this doesn't stop teachers from telling parents to pick out books that fit within often very narrow ranges. This is multi-faceted - how teachers use these scores, how they communicate to parents, and how parents react. But its very frustrating to see parents come in and refuse to try to pick out books their kid might like and just start looking for the first book or set of books that fit that range. Often, they really believe that the teacher will not count the reading if its outside of the range.

I'd like to say at this point that these are issues that seem to be across all sorts of demographics of parents. My main experience is in a very well-off part of my city. But the issues I'm about to bring up fall disproportionately on some populations than others.

1) Parents, part two. Parents are busy, and finding books and reading to their children is incredibly difficult for many of them. If you've been working all day and you have to come home and do all the other things you have to - cooking food, cleaning the house, making sure the homework gets done and the kids are cleaned and so on, adding storytime to that isn't trivial. This is particularly true when you factor in the time and expense in getting books to read to your kids. Assuming you have access to a well-funded library, you still have to take time to go there regularly. If you don't, well, books are expensive.

2) Literacy Education. We as a society don't do much to prepare parents for how to support their kids' learning, particularly before those kids enter school. This definitely impacts parents without degrees, access to high quality childcare, etc. much more than parents with various forms of privilege.",""

"lvk69bv","F0__","2024-11-05 18:06:27 UTC","I am an academic librarian whose life passion is reading. I have kept track of the number of books I've read since I was 15 (I'm now 38). I plummeted from \\~120 a year to \\~50 when smart phones came out. Now with a full time career and two children, I am lucky to get 40.

I think it'd be different if I felt my time were spent on different hobbies, or in a meaningful or creative way, but I feel like it's mostly spent scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. I look at lists of hobbies more often than I engage with them. and that sucks! I want so badly for this to not be the case for my (very ADHD) children.

I do a one-to-one requirement for tablet time: 30 minutes of reading for 30 minutes of tablet time. Anything they want to read, and we take great pleasure going to our special reading nook together. Sometimes they pop right up at the timer, sometimes they read further out.

They both adore graphic novels and I definitely think they 'count' but I won't lie; I do worry about their attention and their ability to read longer things, but that's because of the world at large and their neurotype, not because Big Scary Comics are the culprit.

And the more she read those, the better she got and her confidence soared. She also sees me and my sister with our decked out kindles reading (we take them everywhere) so I got her one for her birthday (talked with the children’s librarian and got her hooked up with Libby) and she’s been reading nonstop since.

Building up attention spans and minimizing social media / iPad use and giving books as outlets is good and all, but until then introducing audiobooks would be a good one too

Add that most literature books are actually often boring, simple in story but difficult to read due to vomiting words on the page since many were paid by the page or the word in those times. Yet the works are considered the best not because actually are but simply because the first at that type of story. First in anything is rarely the best except in literature.

"lvitjmp","DickDastardly404","2024-11-05 13:59:44 UTC","I am usually very against ""technology is the problem"" responses to issues like this.

Plato wrote about Socrates' distaste for the technology of writing itself; he felt that it ruined young people's oration skills, and memory.

Obviously history was not on Socrates' side in this, but my point is that older people have been complaining about new tech forever.

But the second part of your sentence I have to agree with. There is so much slop on the internet these days, so much unregulated content for children, so much substanceless, useless drivel. Whether it's tik tok NPC streams, or YouTube reaction videos, or AI articles, or whatever new social horror crops up next. 

At the end of the day it's not the device at fault, but the parents allowing children unregulated access to the thoughtless, formless noise ground out of the content creation mill. I grew up with this stuff too, but my parents and school gave me the tools to parse fact from fiction and to differentiate crap from quality.

You have always had to control what your kids have access to, whether it's adult content, scary movies, or just playing near the train tracks. They will work around you, but it's your responsibility to adapt to the world we live in, and the big danger right now is the internet sludge they can access through their phones.","lvhov45"

Literally everything I could find. They were super easy for her at this stage. I also came up with a story of magical school and the books being sent by them and some shit.

In the end, my biggest goal is to have them be more discerning about their entertainment choices, to not lean to the bright and shiny because it's bright and shiny but to ask ""hey, why's this bright and shiny? Is it because it's well-made or has someone polished a turd to fine sheen?""","lvhsdk7"

Manga (and any comics) are also great for accessibility. I have concentration issues now due to disability and I hate that I struggle to read like I used to.

He doesn’t have his own tablet or phone but he does play video games. I don’t know that limited screens were the main thing though.

Between parents and teachers, it's no longer their personal inner world but instead something their parents need to scout out first for their protection and that their teachers need to test them on in order to make sure they understand it the way the adults want them to understand it.  It's like trying to solve a puzzle but your parents are giving you the answers beforehand and the teachers are telling you what you've just discovered and what the kid should have learned from the experience.

I’m a librarian, so reading kind of goes with my job. But I hit reading slumps from time to time, and then trying to get back into a book is like trying to run 10km after sitting on the couch for a month. So if you haven’t read anything in a year, 5 years, 10 years… you have to work at it. 

Start with reading something easy and something you enjoy. Start with trying to read uninterrupted for 10 minutes. Literally set a timer. Don’t worry about how much you read in that time, just read. If you need to, take the time to visualise what you’re reading. Then do that every day, until you find you can read for longer, until it starts to feel easy. 

Reading is the only medium where you can see through someone’s eyes and inside their thought processes (whether that character is real or a work of fiction). Reading fiction has so many benefits as well: it helps you develop empathy, it lowers your resting heart rate, it’s excellent for mental health, it is an activity that forces you to focus without distraction.

Even better if a fam can spend at least 15-20 minutes each day reading a book out loud to each other just like families watch a show or movie together (or bigger blocks less frequently.)


Make it fun! Pretend to have an accent or act out the body language. Make a character a family meme. Bring up questions like, what would so and so probably want to eat for dinner or what would so and so do if in a situation? Or maybe you see a shirt someone is wearing at the store and say something like, “whoah, didn’t know so and so sold tshirts lol.” Anything that engages and connects them to the story.

It’s ok, actually encouraged, to read your kid something that is above the kid’s independent reading level. That’s the best way for them to learn new vocabulary!

If it’s a young child, tell them to listen first certainly words (that youve picked out beforehand, randomly.) Tell them if they hear the word of the day, they should yell it out, jump up twice, or some other cue to gameify it and keep them listening. Make it a family competition  if that works for your kids.

If you can’t model reading for your kid…ask your kid about their independent reading. You don’t need to know the story. Just ask badic questions. Kids actually love to discuss their reading if it’s something they know a loved grownup is interested in.

Also model to kids that if a book isn’t hitting it for them, they can stop reading it and try another. This is for independent reading though.

You can also normalize and qualify all the reading we DO do on our devices. My daughter and i started reading certain subreddits’ reddit posts to each other. I will also co-read an interesting article or recipe with her.

Have your kiddo read on FaceTime to a grandparent, or help them make a pretend YouTube video of their reading aloud (real video but not posted.) Setting a kid up to read to a favorite stuffie or pet is also fun for some children. If it’s difficult to find family time, where you’re all together for something like co-reading, making a video of their reading to share with a family member is a great way to keep connected. (I know times are rough and lots of adults are working odd hours or multiple jobs out of necessity. 🫶)

Pay attention to your daily instances that rely on literacy and include your child when feasible. It all adds up!

ETA: If you are fortunate enough to speak another language, whenever possible, keep your child literate in that language also! As a teacher, it is so sad to see kids lose their home language, or be able to speak it but not write/read it. Being bilingual (or better) is going to be increasingly advantageous in our world. It’s also a great way to support your child’s cultural identity!

2nd ETA: Another trick is to keep subtitles on while watching shows/movies sometimes. It’s hard for a brain to see words and not read them. They get context for new vocabulary bc it’s built-in via the acting.

3rd ETA: (Sorry, can you tell I’m passionate about this? Please forgive me & keep on if i sound annoying. 😬)
Make reading together a fun experience. Pretend you’re around a campfire with a lantern or have a special snack to eat. Treat it like an important experience and kids tend to follow that lead. In our class we take off our shoes and kids can lounge under desks or build forts. That’s when we have our snacktime and even my most resistant readers will at least listen. There is so much competing to catch a kid’s attention nowadays. It doesn’t have to be ridiculously exciting, but adding a little something to the experience can help them rewire how they feel about literacy. 🤓

4th ETA: Last one! Parents seem to feel like they’ll make a mistake with reading and kids. It’s not as high-stakes! Anything is better than nothing. I promise you won’t mess up your kid’s learning or anything. Lastly, ask your child’s teacher for recs, resources, or ideas. We are ALWAYS happy to help a family member extend literacy outside of the classroom! It delights us to no end, and can be a great opportunity to ask other questions about your kid’s learning. If your child’s teacher is not good at that kind of thing, I guarantee your child’s school librarian LOVES children’s literature and will be more than happy to offer suggestions!

Can't imagine a kid would have it any easier identifying the difference. 

I also don't have a very large house to store a massive library of books to read physically to mitigate this. 

There's also the simple fact that I get genuinely overwhelmed trying to find new books/series to get invested in.

Now I'll argue that the reduced book reading isn't the end of the world - there are many people on YouTube who make well formed, engaging, thought provoking content. Be that true crime dramas, scientific misconduct history, accident investigation, literary analysis, historical scientific mistakes and missteps, etc. 

I feel like a not-insignificant part of the problem really is the overwhelming glut of choice. There are so so many good books. But there's just as many bad books. And probably several dozen times as many simply mediocre-to-me books. I'm a big sucker for emotionally driven character dramas, with  ""everyone at every age can probably stand to hear this lesson"" being a common thread. It can be a struggle to find a book that catches me and draws me deeper into the characters in order to engage in the book at large. I can't imagine how difficult it would be if I hadn't stumbled upon those few books that helped me figure this out. 

Sadly I don't know any good way to help combat this problem. Many of the books we mandate we should read are fine, but maybe aren't the kind of books that inspire children - or myself - to go out and read like a wildfire through a forest.","lvhuemc"

"lvi6rrc","Psittacula2","2024-11-05 11:16:34 UTC","The main analogy I would suggest for “children + reading“ vs “children + digital stimulus - reading” is:

\\* Early experience of nutritious diet for children all natural food and prepared VS

\\* High sugar or synthetic flavourings or junk food diet

Here is the problem:

1. If you start off with the latter, it ruins the taste buds and the kid rejects the healthy food!  
2. To succeed at the former, not only do you have to prepare the correct material/nutrition you ALSO MUST excluding the bad or unhealthy material/nutrition because it only takes a few mouthfuls of candy to ruin the taste buds whereas it takes weeks or months to ween children onto good food from milk.

This is all early on, so for books same principle applies:

\\* No digital access for young toddlers or babies at all.

\\* Nursury songs and rhymes and simple melodies

\\* Bedtime stories

\\* Basic reading together phonics

\\* play acts and puppets telling a story

And eventually, as you correctly say:

Source books for children diversely:

Egs

1. Wildlife identification book with photos

2. Poems and songs

3. Spot the book

4. Interactive story book go to page…

5. Fairy Tales eg Grimm

6. Let’s make… books

As can been seen there is SERIOUS PARENTAL INVESTMENT from knowledge and planning to scheduling and interacting to iterating based on mood and progress.

And I didn't end up with traumas or anything haha. Now, maybe another kid would spend months scared of Pennywise, that depends on the kid, obviously. But sometimes parents don't want their kids to read about scary stuff or *gasp* sex and it's just... stupid.

"lvohkgr","Psittacula2","2024-11-06 09:19:57 UTC","Not familiar if you are talking about US. For UK the schools themselves and the teacher makes the biggest impact AFTER parents themselves when they start their first year. From what I remember of learning reading it is more about association and basic phonics immersion and over time the brain soaks it up, not dissimilar to language acquisition in adult learners. Again in both cases, it takes time and exposure ie the necessity of parents to talk and read and associate with the toddler over a period of time. The first year of school in UK if the teacher is experienced is ensuring all the children are the same level, including extra coaching for the ones behind.

As said the biggest issue starts in the home with digital devices and neglect or low quality substitution for the immersion and association process. I am not entirely in agreement that specific methods make more difference than that, that is more the skill and experience of the teacher in what works with the student, from my own observations, again not relevant to US perhaps.","lvm5nqe"

BUT I was encouraged to read in my own time….which led to ME reading to my sister when she was young.

Now she’s easily the smartest in the family, it’s pretty great. She was reading encyclopedias by kindergarten, so she has the capability, and smarts, just needed a push. 

Started with the easy stuff, but the last book I can remember reading her was The Hobbit, which while definitely a children’s book, it did set her up to jump into heavier stuff later. 

Now, should siblings necessarily NEED to do this? No, and given many siblings despise each other, it’s not surprising many don’t. But with the large age-gap with my sister, I was in a good place to do so, and largely, we’ve never been antagonistic.","lvk2p7o"

Things like Boxcar Children, Stuart Little, right now we’re working on an illustrated abridged Treasure Island and we’re both enjoying it so much.

I consciously made the switch back to physical books when my kid turned 1yrs so I could model it. I also use a kindle. It made a big difference pretty quickly; I see him picking up my books, flipping through them, even bringing them to me. I have a single shelf of books and comics I actually own, I started re-reading my favorites. He can’t speak well yet but will keep picking a certain one up and saying “mama favorite book”🥹 

Right now I need 2 books, one for him to play with and the other for me to read. We often sit together quietly while I read and he just pages through novels. He is 2, he can’t read by himself yet. I’ll also sometimes read a novel outloud to him. We did War of the Worlds and just starting Ender’s Game. Its so cute, he likes to bring the book to me and asks for it. I didn’t force this action, just seeing me open a book and sit quietly caused him to get curious and copy me. I think he seems to get joy from the tactile experience of flipping real pages. 

You have a lot of power in your hands as your kids’ first role model, you can make the switch if it it’s important to you! I’m also finding it very enjoyable in the sense that books are more interesting than hours of YouTube and Reddit.","lvibg2s"

I think you do have a responsibility to protect your kids from damaging things, and it takes a couple of generations for this stuff to become common sense. 

but at the same time, even though the parent does need to be the first and last bastion of defence, there need to be proper regulations on content as well. 

When children's programming was all on television, there were groups like ACT who specifically campaigned to make sure that children's content was appropriate, high quality, and educational. 

They brought a lot of rules and regulations into law about what kids TV is allowed to be. Obviously there has still been a lot of dross over the years, but there's rules, and companies can be held accountable for what they broadcast. 

On youtube and tik-tok, and any other platform where the users create the content and value, there is no such regulation for content aimed at children. This is a huge problem, and companies wont forgo profit for morality, the same way many parents wont forgo the convenience of putting the kid in front of the iPad to shut them up.

The first study you linked is focused on how screen based media impacts the literacy and language skills of children. The operative word there is media, not screen. The report seems to broadly agree with my suggestion that the type of media being consumed on those screens is the issue.

If I give a kid an iPad with age appropriate, interesting, fun, educational content on it, it's different than if I hand them my phone loaded with Mr Beast videos. 

The second one seems like a pretty balanced study presenting the idea that while extended periods of internet use can cause negative effects on our social and emotional intelligence as well as symptoms of attention deficit, playing certain games and engaging in other types of content can actually improve brain health.

You could say the same thing about every form of entertainment or aspects of modern life.

If you think video games are uniquely bad or *not* beneficial compared to movies, tv, comics, board games, and even books then I think you should really reconsider that.

Growing up, games cultivated passions and hobbies, and encouraged me to use critical thinking skills, fostered my creativity, grappled with storytelling and political topics generated by the game's story just as much or more then those other mediums did, and I'm somebody who also read novels *intensively*.

In fact, I did my high school graduation project on the beneficial aspects of video games, there is a lot of scholarly research and data showing they improve motor, problem solving, etc skills. Also, almost every person I knew growing up who were entirely closed off from a medium liked this ended up resenting it later in life. 

I would at least encourage you to consider getting them older video game consoles, which don't have online functions, lack addictive microtransactions, etc. Like a Playstation 2, a Nintendo 64, etc. You can get Flashcarts and load modded memory cards to put games on them, etc.

Or hell, a Nintendo Switch has a lot of titles in the vein of older games without heavy online stuff or microtransactions, that with even minimal oversight from you would be fine.","lvjm5gh"

We started with A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens and after that, we picked up things like The Invisible Man, War of the Worlds, The Time Machine, she requested Frankenstein and Dracula a few years later. Seriously, by the time she was 5, she was stopping me to ask questions (either to make sure she understood something or to ask what a word meant - I was kind of shocked, I wasn't sure how much of Great Expectations she was getting, but her question showed me she was absolutely following along). This isn't some mondo gifted kid, this is just a regular kid who ended up really enjoying reading and still does as an adult. :) Some of my greatest memories are the times we spent reading together and later discussing what I'd read.

But equally, I don’t think teachers and parents should be complacent and treat comics and graphic novels as if they’re equivalent to novels. [Take this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/) about how many college students in the USA struggle to read whole books — reading comic books and novels can build literacy, but the fact that fewer and fewer kids are reading actual novels *is* a problem. It shouldn’t be an either/or situation. Let kids read graphic novels, but also try to encourage them to read actual novels and non-fiction books.","lvk1kwq"
"lvm6aw0","hedgehogwriting","2024-11-06 00:09:27 UTC","> The question is “do kids read in their spare time or not”. And yes manga and comics count as reading in your spare time.
 
Never said it didn’t. Just pointed out that there is a fundamental difference between comics/graphic novels and books, and it’s not just “they have pictures”, it’s that the pictures replace the words and therefore they don’t help advance kids’ literacy/reading skills in the same way reading novels do. That doesn’t mean kids shouldn’t read them, but they shouldn’t be considered equivalent to novels. There’s nuance to be had. I’m not saying “graphic novels don’t count”, I’m just saying that reading a graphic novel is not the same as reading a novel — which should be obvious, because graphic novels are a visual medium and novels are not, they’re inherently different. 

> I’m not a manga or comics reader, but I don’t see why we should be gatekeeping reading for enjoyment as only counting if it’s a 600 page classic from 2 centuries ago.

This has absolutely nothing to do with what I said.

> Literacy rates are a different discussion. This article is talking about what people like to do in their spare time, and it’s OK for people to like other things. Two of my kids are advanced readers by national test standards but one loves reading, the other hates it. And that’s fine, he has other hobbies, like drawing and cooking. He can read just fine, what he does in his spare time is not inferior to the others.

Literacy rates are not a different discussion. Reading for pleasure is linked to higher reading ability. Not to mention that this report is literally by the National *Literacy* Trust, whose aim is improving literacy in the UK. If you actually read the article you would see that it says:

“The NLT found that twice as many children who said they enjoy reading in their spare time have above average reading skills (34.2%) compared with those who don’t enjoy it (15.7%).”

Obviously reading comics and graphic novels in their spare time will also contribute to this, I’m not saying it won’t. However, graphic novels and comics simply don’t exercise reading skills in the same way novels do because, again, they mostly have fewer words. I’m not knocking comics and graphic novels, there are many that I enjoy. But they are a visual medium, meaning less of the information is conveyed through words than in novels — so no, reading a comic book/graphic novel is not the *same* as reading a novel.","lvm20gu"

1. Provide a healthy nutritious environment

2. The habit of eating healthy food has much more chance of establishing and avoiding obesity or other insulin resistance problems later on but is no guarantee.

I would argue same with correct reading practices by parents:

I taught early years and good parenting means the children are toilet trained and can learn their words at school a lot better than otherwise. Notably kids who don’t have this and have reading and writing or counting issues will always struggle through school academic subjects eg “They cannot read the question” or “Write a coherent sentence to answer the question” even if they have the right knowledge etc.

As to reading as a habit in the modern world with digital it is bound to fall but not for anyone who receives good childhood habits who may then generate natural “intellectual curiosity” and so seek out books via their own internal motivation and enjoyment.

There is clear reason why in my nation literacy rates are declining in every age group taken at national stats level… because of lack of early environment.

"lvijlit","bookish__era","2024-11-05 12:58:07 UTC","I’m with you completely. Husband and I love reading (as a lot of people in the comments are talking about examples being set at home, books being available in the house, etc.). We read every day and I’m a writer by profession. Our son is a young teen and has had zero interest in reading his entire life. We’ve gotten him tested for dyslexia and other things that could impact his ability, and he’s fine. He *can* read well, he just doesn’t like to. 

We’ve tried countless books and styles - some have stuck more than others but none have given him that itch to read. He has a phone but no social media and doesn’t spend a ton of time on it. He doesn’t play video games and really just has tv on in the background. He has other hobbies/extracurriculars and is also pretty damn busy being in HS. 

He just doesn’t like reading. Would I love for him to? Of course, hence why we’ve tried so much! Will it one day click for him? Hopefully! But some people just aren’t readers and you can’t force it. His aunt and uncle were both the same way (from both sides of the family, before cell phones).

I do see the value in reading, but I’m with you on the moralizing of hobbies. And I don’t see the drop in pleasure reading as a harbinger of doom or hallmark of bad parenting lol. Now if we were talking about literacy, that would be different. But tbh, this feels a bit overblown to me.

ETA: It’s also bizarre that people will simultaneously lament the drop in pleasure reading, while also condemning BookTok as making hobby reading too… trendy? Feels very elitist and specific to me","lvhz2m2"

The country im from was a former British colony, and my family were mixed-race from the colonial times. 

That meant that while my parents could speak the local languages, English, and specifically a very upper-class level of English lessons meant my dad at least taught me a lot of basics. My mom, despite being from a lower-class background, took great pride in being able to speak English well, which meant that despite my parents lack of time to read to me, that reading itself was very much encouraged and since I was left with babysitters often, I often was taken to the library to read on my own. 

The real challenge I think comes from engaging with a child’s interests in what they want to learn about; many books taught in school, while important, are seen as work. However, the Hobbit and LOTR books were on the curriculum where I grew up, right around the time of the movies. Since that was topical, and movie trips to go see them and compare to the books were an assignment, my classmates and I were VERY keen.

Bribery DOES admittedly help; my parents rewarded good English marks with money to spend on books at the scholastic book days! Sometimes a kid needs a reward.

The fact we don’t really have a “Harry Potter” equivalent for kids to go crazy for isn’t helping; while I hate to blame tech, iPads are used for videos, instead of the viral trend being reading the newest kids book in a series.","lvmnfyp"

—————  
  
Ok I got frustrated trying to remember and half-assedly describe a barely remembered plot so I stopped to borrow the book on Libby and half read half skimmed the whole thing before submitting this comment. 4th book in the Wrinkle in Time quintet “Many Waters” with protagonists Sandy and Dennys, boys, age 15. It’s basically Horny Pubescent Sexual Awakenings: The Book of Love, Sex, Death, and Politics, both from the male and female perspectives, and that basically gets going as early as Chapter 2.  
  
The first book and this book can be compared to the difference between (in the His Dark Materials series by Pullman) The Golden Compass and the chapters in The Amber Spyglass where >! Lyra and Will fall in love and their daemons finally settle, making them teenagers. !< In fact, while neither Many Waters nor The Amber Spyglass have the protagonists having sex, technically The Amber Spyglass is far less explicit (though IMO it made more of an impression in that way emotionally). Wouldn’t read Many Waters to a 5-year old, mostly because the main takeaway would be the sexual stuff while everything else, particularly the mental growth towards maturity and understanding L’Engle’s way of writing about jealousy and temptation and xenophobia, would be a huge confusing mess.","lvi9ndy"

Each of us, individually. I thought it was pretty neat because there was some titles I didn’t care for, but I chose to read Monster by Walter Dean Myers for the first time since it was on the list. The book sounded interesting and frankly it was much shorter than the other books. It was one of the few times I actually completely felt like I digested the book thoroughly (even finished it way beforehand). There were times in other grades from before where I just had to skim through required books because I was procrastinating due to the severe lack of interest in those books. Only because I didn’t have a choice to read them. I thought it was interesting and also nice way of teaching for what my teacher did and letting us choose from those select few of titles.

Instead, teachers spend a lot of time teaching exam skills with shorter works or let students get by just reading parts of novels.  Being able to sit down with a challenging novel, read it in a week, think about it, and actually make a cogent argument about it in class later requires a lot of different skills and for the last 20 years or so, fewer and fewer students are learning them.

If your other teachers didn't let you choose, it may be because they were trying to prepare you for the sorts of tasks they thought you'd be facing in college.

They are not. They do not have as many words as novels. Take a novel, now replace 80% of the words with pictures that signify the same thing. Is that equivalent, in terms of reading? Obviously not. Do I need evidence to prove that?

> kids nowadays not having the attention span and literacy to read actual novels is a problem

[Here.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/)

[Here.](https://www.thebookseller.com/news/reading-declines-for-children-for-first-time-after-pandemic-report-says)

[Here.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/child-literacy-reading-cost-pandemic-b2501461.html)

There are tons of sources out there showing that literacy and book reading rates are declining in children and young people. 

>Being able to read and engage with long-form text is important, and comic books and graphic novels aren’t a part of that

Okay, I’m somewhat generalising here because obviously some graphic novels have more words than others. Diary of a Wimpy Kid, for example, is more like a novel with illustrations, compared to other graphic novels that are more like elongated comic books. But I think we can both agree that in general, comic books and graphic novels are not long texts in the way novels are. Do you need me to provide evidence for that? Unless the part you disagree with is me saying that being able to read long texts is an important skill?

> It’s not about the fact that they have pictures, it’s about the fact that the pictures replace a lot of the words meaning you’re not physically reading as much.

Again, I’m not really sure what you disagree with here? Graphic novels and comics do replace words with pictures. That’s… literally the point of them. A comic isn’t going to have an illustration of a scene and also a paragraph describing it. They are a visual medium. They do have fewer words than novels. If you took your average novel, kept all of the words, and also added illustrations, it would be way too big. There are plenty of graphic novel versions of published novels and, guess what, the graphic novel versions have fewer words, because they replace them with pictures! That is literally the point. 

I’m sort of confused about your point here, because if you don’t believe the statement “Graphic novels have fewer words than novels because many of the words that would be in novels are replaced by illustrations” to be true without needing “evidence” then… maybe pick up a graphic novel and see for yourself?","lvjxlm8"

By comparison, students who tended to read books more often on digital devices scored only 15 points higher than students who rarely read – a difference of less than a year’s worth of learning.""

"lvkwpza","Al--Capwn","2024-11-05 20:15:04 UTC","That still doesn't mean they spent anywhere near as long - people don't spend as long in their room as they do on screens now. It's better for obvious reasons. A telephone call is just a conversation; using a modern device hijacks the brain through the touch screen, the visuals and sound, and the design which preys on psychology to exploit emotion. It's nothing like the same thing.","lvk2nw4"

"lvivi7r","Former_Foundation_74","2024-11-05 14:11:18 UTC","""Advocating for children reading is rejected"" that's not what's happening though.

 I'm all for kids reading more. I posted in another comment a laundry list of things I did and still do to encourage a love of reading in my own children. I just think we can get there without shaming kids for enjoying other things, or putting reading on a pedestal.","lvir9oz"

There is middle ground between a formal dissertation and pulling assertions out of thin and and then trying to justify them by pulling even more assertions out of thin air.","lvkrc3v"
"lvl18gg","Laura9624","2024-11-05 20:37:07 UTC","Lol. ""The telephone was often viewed with skepticism and not a little fear. There was something magical about sounds coming from a thin wire, and many people were afraid that the contents of the lines would spill out in some way if there was a break. Many elderly persons refused to touch a telephone for fear of electrical shock. The greatest fear, however, was that the telephone was in some way able to attract evil spirits""

The things change, the more they stay the same.","lvkwpza"

But in this context, it's just unnecessary and annoying. We're dealing in the realm of common sense and common experiences.","lvl9kpk"
