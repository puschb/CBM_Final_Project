"lqhwihs","SoothingDisarray","2024-10-05 18:44:35 UTC","Narrating audiobooks is a tough job. You are performing, kind of, but also with limits. You have to keep a consistent pacing and volume, even if the text says the character is speaking rapidly or yelling or whispering. You have to make character voices distinct without making them too ""voice actory"" or else your interpretation of the character will overwhelm the story. 

When I listen to an audiobook I want someone to effectively convey the words on the page to me so I can read the book with my ears. Does that make sense? I'm not listening to a radio play, I'm reading a book. I need the narrator to be more neutral than other forms of spoken media, while still being compelling enough to listen to for many hours. 

There are some audiobook narrators I avoid because they speed up and slow down, they lower their voices to a whisper and I can't make out the words. Their voices are so elaborate that it feels more like storytime for kids than a book reading.

So, yes, I often listen at a higher rate of speed and feel no qualms about it. I still really respect the difficult work of a quality audiobook narrator.

(It depends on the book and the narrator though. If the narrator has a British accent I tend to listen at a slower rate of speed. One time I listened to  Trainspotting and I had to make it less than 1x speed because I had so much trouble understanding.)

"lqih39s","RutabagasnTurnips","2024-10-05 20:35:42 UTC","I often speed things up a bit for fiction reading. The pace is often too slow for me. Even with things sped up I find I still catch things like changes in pace for certain characters speech/personality, or tone of when reading a more tense or scary scene. So speeding up doesn't detract from my enjoyment and often improves it which is what I care about most. Regardless of how THEY(the osne voice acting) feel, my goal is to enjoy my audiobook experience. If picking up the pace does that, I do it. On very rare exceptions would I listen to thing at √ó1 when it's fiction/recreational reading. Those are the exceptionally well done audio recordings for things where the meaning of what happens changes a lot pending where you put your pause. Like ""I love cooking, my dogs, and my family"". If I listened to that one at 2-2.5x, pending my level of attention, I may have to rewind and listen slower to ensure I didn't just hear that they said ""...love cooking my dogs and family"" *checks info to see if written by Thomas Harris*¬†




There is one exception. That's when I do non-fiction audiobook and the topics discussed include a lot of data, epidemiology etc. When the book is filled with all the science stuff.


This is because for me to understand these things I needs to conceptualize the info in different fashions to understand and realize it better. I also have a bad habit of hearing or reading information and then having my brain going in 12 different directions. Especially for socioeconomic and health related things. So I like to do mental image concept mapping or physical concept mapping to ""see"" and understand it ""right"". So having things slower (or x1 pace) gives my brain and hands more time to do this before the next peice of information gets added into the thought/""picture"". Pending on how complex the information is I may even pause the audio to let the info settle and then refocus.¬†",""

If it's too slow it's genuinely distracting, it's not just me being impatient. Most narrators, no offense to any here, talk very, very slow when narrating books. That's probably a good thing to have as a baseline, it's just too slow to sound natural to me.

It's also a cadence issue because most books (unless they're a documentation of oral storytelling) were written to be read internally, vs being performed out loud. The narrator serves as a substitute for the internal voice. I straight up disagree with a lot of narration pacings too, because ideally if you're reading written media out loud there should be more deliberation on oral adaptation. 

The next best thing is for me to match the audiobook speed to around how fast I would want to read it internally. Sometimes that's 2.5x other times that's 1x, usually it's somewhere in between.

"lqizxrv","nv87","2024-10-05 22:20:15 UTC","As someone who reads books to children and is frequently complimented on their reading performance I concur. I definitely have reasons for pauses, for speaking more slowly or quickly etc and therefore imo some of the atmosphere at the very least is lost. It largely depends on just how much you speed up the pace of course. I would say that quality rapidly diminishes with increasing pace. 

I have personally also been averse to speeding up videos for the longest because I felt the loss of quality very strongly. However I recently started moderately speeding up one or two particular YouTubers. However we are talking about someone just talking slowly in their let‚Äôs play, not a performance like an audiobook reading. 

Another issue for me would be understanding everything. Not the language or words, but the meaning, inflections, subtexts, ‚Ä¶ I guess audiobooks are just not my medium in general, because I only found myself listening to them when occupied with something else and then I have a hard time following them even on 1,0x speed so I would never be tempted to increase the pace. 

I guess I just prefer reading physically. But because I read aloud quite frequently I thought I would still voice my sympathy for the performers sentiments.

Edit: 

I admit I am learning quite a bit from reading the comments here. I had kind of thought that having the book performed was part of the allure of listening to audio books but that is apparently not the case for many listeners and not intended by the narrator in most cases. Very surprised by this tbh. 

A minority seems to have the same listening experience as I have, while others say they just want the gist of the story. That‚Äôs of course totally fair, my father reads books like that. I am positive if I wanted to I could read at least at double my usual speed if I only cared about the story. If I do catch myself having missed something or glossed over a paragraph I go back and read that page a second time. So kind of a different approach and probably partly why audiobooks don‚Äôt work for me anyways.",""

I've always been a fan of audio drama to begin with, so that definitely inured me to the idea of these kind of performances, but I think it's worth noting that two of my favorite audiobooks are ones in which the performers are not only noted, but *lauded* for doing this: Laura Linney's *Nancy Drew* and Jim Dale's *Harry Potter*.

Linney does this pseudo-gruffness thing with her voice when some of the more evil men in the series appear (and for what seems to be an intentionally humorous effect, to boot!) and as for Jim Dale, not only does he do falsetto bits for the women, when he does Professor McGonagall, he layers it atop a solid Scottish accent too!

Although I'm certainly tempted to, I'm not going to skip ahead in the series to see how he'll tackle Dolores Umbridge's famously delicate throat clearing in *Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix*.

Alas.

It's also worth noting that I've found elements of Kinney's performance as Nancy (such as, say, the *absolute* revulsion in how she says something as simple as ""Oh no!"" when Nancy gets a flat tire on her brand new 'roadster') to ""feel"" just as important to the character of Nancy as her [Hammerspace‚Ñ¢](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Hammerspaceweb.JPG)¬†flashlights or resourcefulness are.

The same goes for Dale's performances. 

In *Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban*, for example, there's a scene where Ron "". . . bellow\\[s\\] . . . as though he and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field . . ."" when speaking on the telephone, and Dale's ability to swap from the righteously furious Vernon to the loudly bewildered Ron, replete with the exasperation of the ""Can You Hear Me ***Now***?"" Guy‚Ñ¢ are just as ingrained into how I visualize and/or imagine the characters as Richard Griffith's and Rupert Grint's respective movie portrayals are, which is a bit ironic considering that this scene was never filmed, but I digress.

Guilty! But I watch French plays as well as English, and French is legitimately faster (though maybe not than David Tennant in *Good*). And argh, the worst is when some German regietheater production decides to insert some new spoken sections throughout an opera! Usually with excruciatingly German 'humour'. Not so much 'hurry up' as 'someone please smother the director responsible'.(Admittedly I also think long overtures should be cut, if I wanted to listen to a classical music concert, I would! It's just the composer tricking the lower-brow opera audience into putting up with their serious music! I'm here for stupid melodramatics and camp costumes!).

Seriously though, I think it's that reading yourself can be *drastically* faster. Some English audiobooks (*not* French, in my experience) aren't even just read slower than you can read, but slower than normal speech.","lqia3r4"

As someone that is known to get kids hyped up for the book sessions, I don't.

If I made the characters feel like they're dying and if I were to take 5 minutes for each word, the kids would be hating those moments instead of liking them too.

And I bet you aren't reading to kids like you're dying either or you wouldn't be complimented. Characters are alive. Some will be meek, anxious, slow, etc other's will be fast paced and extroverted and out there.

You can't make them all feel like they're dying and struggling to get another word out... It won't even be in-character.

Which is what the vast majority of narrators make me feel... It's like they're struggling to know what word to say next and that they're sounding out every single word.

 I hate the typical audiobook at the original speed because it's like they're reading for cognitive impaired people that need a whole hour to proccess a single sentence.

But changing the speed at which a book is read doesn't change the work. Sure, it changes the performance of the narration, but I don't see an audiobook as akin to an audio play or movie or theatre, where the performances are a constituent part of the work. Just like the print book, the _words_ are the work. It's just hearing the book out loud as an alternative to reading it. The narration is just a delivery method for the words, the same way a typeface might be in print.

Yeah, it's good to have an appropriate typeface to ease reading instead of printing a book in 11-point Impact, but the font itself usually isn't part of the work. It's nice to have a natural voice with inflections read you a story instead of a robotic Microsoft Sam in order to make understanding easier, but the voice isn't really part of the work (there are going to be exceptions, I know, as there are print books in which the author dictates the typesetting because it's presentation actually part of the work, and I assume there are some audio books where something analogous is going on with the narration).

You really do just get used to it over time and trying to listen to anything slower is almost agonizing to be honest because it's so slow.

A lot of drama shows are so bad about inserting these lengthy pauses because they think it adds tension to the scene - when in fact, they're often a half-baked director that added it because they need to pad runtime. 2x makes those so much more bearable. 

I have done 3x on occasion - usually only with people who speak slowly normally.  I have found I need to slow down to 1.5 or even 1.2 for people with thick accents. But even with those, my ear will usually adjust and I can speed back up after a few minutes. 

I will also say that the audio codec probably matters more than the actual person talking. Once upon a time, anything higher than 1x sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks.

"lqncxhk","stormdelta","2024-10-06 17:47:11 UTC","For me it depends heavily on what it is.

For faster narrators and books with faster pacing or that I want to take my time with, I might go as low as 1.2. And on average, I'm usually somewhere between 1.2 and 1.8. I also tend to go closer to 1.2 if it's a full cast production e.g. Graphic Audio.

For slower narrators or overly verbose / pulpy writing, I'll go as high as 2x while still sounding relatively natural especially after a couple minutes.

I can go as high as 3x or even 3.5x and still understand it, but that's usually only in extreme cases and often a sign that I'm not that into the book (or I'm scanning a section to find a particular part but that doesn't really count).

"lql98f1","DarthRegoria","2024-10-06 08:49:41 UTC","Authors who are already actors or performers (comedians for example) usually narrate their books quite well, but that already part of their job that they‚Äôre used to. Some I believe started narrating other‚Äôs audiobooks, and now read their own works. Stephen Fry is the main one I‚Äôm thinking of here, but it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm getting the timeline wrong. I do think his first audiobook narration was Harry Potter, but I could be wrong. 

But again, Fry has been an actor, comedian and TV show host for decades, and is an excellent orator and storyteller. I adore his narration of Hitch-hiker, it‚Äôs such a prefect story for him to read. So it‚Äôs not a stretch for him to go from reading other people‚Äôs books and performing his own material on stage to reading his own books. 

But authors who aren‚Äôt performers in some way often aren‚Äôt as good at narrating as the professional narrators. 

Generally, I‚Äôve found Australian and English actors to be better at reading audiobooks than American actors, but it could just be my own preference as an Australian to hear voices that sound more like my own. But I think it‚Äôs in the style too. *Some* American narrators really ‚Äòoveract‚Äô the voices, or put on voices for the different characters, and some sound like terrible caricatures rather than real characters. Of course, there are times when the reader does this and it works for the particular novel, like a lot of the Star Wars audiobooks I listen to. Especially when it‚Äôs a full cast production with sound effects as well, which Star Wars novels lend themselves well to. Ironically, I love James Masters as a narrator for The Dresden Files and I think some other books, but I‚Äôm most familiar with him as an actor from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, where he played an English character with a reasonably well done Cockney accent. Not perfect, but much better than many other American actors trying to do an English accent. 

I‚Äôve really enjoyed all the His Dark Materials and Book of Dust audiobooks I‚Äôve listened to. Two were full cast audiobook productions, possibly with some sound effects. I think one was read by Phillip Pullman, the author. And the two Book of Dust ones were read by Michael Sheen, a Welsh actor who read quite well, but a little slow for my taste. I think I listened to those mostly at 1.2 speed, unless I was trying to fall asleep, when I set them to 0.8. 0.7 is usually my go to speed for falling asleep to an audiobook, but Michael read a bit slowly for me, so .8 was good. 

Sometimes I listen to audiobooks at the regular speed, sometimes I speed them up a little. I have ADHD and tend to think fast, and get frustrated by slow readers. But I‚Äôm currently listening to The Three Body Problem, and I‚Äôm listening to the more dense physics/ scientific content around .9 or .95 to give myself time to process the new concepts. This is after watching the TV series too, so I have some idea of the story. If I was reading it, I would probably reread some of the more complex passages to help it sink in. I have rewound and listened to some parts 2 or 3 times to really understand what they‚Äôre talking about. I‚Äôm good with basic science and some very basic astrophysics (I am quite interested in space) but a lot of the concepts in the book are very new to me, and listening to this particular book takes more care and processing than most of the stuff I read usually does.","lqi40uj"

Edit: after writing this I read the latter half of your comment (I wouldn‚Äôt before because I felt attacked for no reason) 

So now that I know you feel like audiobooks are narrated to slowly and why and that you describe that as dying. Yeah we are basically of the exact same opinion then. I hadn‚Äôt known that audiobooks are usually narrated without voices and extra slowly for the impaired audience but I learned from other comments that that is indeed the case. I totally understand why people who actually actively listen to them, and have no impairment, need to speed up things. 

I think my comment was clear enough on the point that I was under the assumption that audiobooks were performed similarly to how I read books aloud and also my edit very clearly shows that I learned after writing it, that that wasn‚Äôt the case. 

So yeah I do indeed do not read as of if I were dying, I do not take five minutes per page and some of my characters are indeed energetic etc

Then I can easily annotate, stop and look things of interest up (like painters mentioned in *The Goldfinch*, ATM), and analyse any striking passages. Audiobooks are either for French listening practice -and French is spoken genuinely faster than English, so is Ok anyway. And even classic French plays are typically *very* fast and would lose the rhythm otherwise, so notions of performance may differ-, or more purely for entertainment purposes, usually to have something to listen to while crafting or doing a repetitive task in a game. Some are more worth a performance, like Mantel's *Beyond Black* at present, in which the narrator is doing an incredible job with the crazy mixture of spookiness, black humour, characters being alarmingly casual about horrifying topics, and creating empathy for their deeper trauma (can't think of any book where the characters have felt more real, despite the magical realist weirdness of having depressingly mundane ghosts appearing all over the place), but I could still wish the narrator would speed up at times.

Although tbf I'm also just finding some of the subject matter really difficult and wanting some sections to be over, like *The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida* (which is also full of unexpectedly ordinary dead people), am very interested but it's a bit too much for me in parts. Mantel is good enough to be well worth reading myself more fully attentively (there's absolutely bits in *Seven Moons*, though I read every word, I speed read), it's just that I can't handle that with this one!","lqhz4ua"

But because I use screen readers 100% of the time while browsing webpages or even utilizing Reddit like here, I am naturally speeding up the speech synthesizer so that I can get the information faster.


However, when I am listening to an audiobook, I do not speed it up quite as fast unless their narrator is particularly slow. But I have no qualms about speeding something up to a speed that I am comfortable with without feeling like I am wasting too much time trying to get through a section or something. And while I do not typically increase the speed of my audiobooks as much as I do webpages and word processors on the like, I am doing it more and more often as I become accustomed to receiving information at that speed while listening. But certain books, I would never speed up specifically because of the performance, while other books, the performance is so stilted or bad sometimes it is the story alone that needs to carry me through it and not the performance. I have noticed this occurs in audio recordings from the 1950s and 60s. There was just something about their cadence back then, that felt a little too formal and Like a documentary rather than a performance. And that works wonderful for some type of stories, but not for all. And those cases I do tend to speed up and I have no regrets on that front.","lqim5e2"

You're assuming people will read/listen at that pace just for the numbers and not that the amount people read comes naturally.

Which is exactly my issue with this. It comes accross as ""I'm better because I don't read as much"" and then you have the opposite but same snobish attitude from others on the other side like ""omg this person only read 10 books a year, what an illiterate"".

It's either exactly or almost exactly the same amount, read exactly the same way (to some audiobooks are just for lazy people too, etc) or this ""community"" loses it's mind...

I met someone a while ago with an insane amount of books per year and after talking to this person (without being insecure bc they outnumber me by the hundreds in how much they read) this person proceeded to explain that they were highly disabled and that they spent pretty much all their time reading bc it was one of the few things that brought them joy in life and that they were still able to do.

This person wasn't chasing some number. This person reads a lot and likes to read. Yet this person started to avoid discussing their number of books they read every year in some online spaces bc they end up being accused of lying, of speeding, of not reading it all, etc...

But obviously this ""community"" doesn't basically bully people because they read too much/too little/too different than how they want them to...and they also obviously don't exclude and aren't highly judgmental of others... Nah/s","lqmbscp"

Those things are both tied to your IQ, which generally stays the same throughout your life. How fast can your brain process the information it's getting? From there, the more your read the more you build your vocabulary, the more you understand the formatting of books, which in turn let you read faster. You're not necessarily training your brain to read faster but to read smarter. 

I read incredibly fast, always have. If I'm reading a book and listening to audio at the same time, the very minimum speed I can listen at is 2x otherwise I'm reading faster than the audiobook narrator. Many times it's closer to 2.5x. If I'm listening without the reading the physical book, I usually listen at 1.5x.
