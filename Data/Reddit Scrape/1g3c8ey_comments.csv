**The Poisonwood Bible, by Barbara Kingsolver**

I really enjoyed the book, it was just a tad long for my liking. I also think I missed out on this potentially being the religious/diplomatic awakening that it's been for others because I went down that road years ago. Still, great storytelling and dialogue. I moved Demon Copperhead up my waitlist a bit after reading.

**We'll Prescribe You a Cat, by Syou Ishida**

Still reeling a bit after finishing this one. It hit me harder than I expected it too and almost left me equally confused. I'm excited to look at reviews and discussion because I just finished it earlier today.

STARTED

**Capital Vol 1, by Karl Marx**

Admittedly, I've never really given political theory books a chance. It's not nearly as dry as I anticipated. The footnotes help and reading with a monthly book club will, I hope, help to hold my attention.

**The Message, by Ta-Nehisi Coates**

I hadn't planned to read this one until after the election, but the abrasion that Coates has received from mainstream media (mainly CBS) has piqued my interest early. I think it's fascinating for someone as successful as Coates, especially given his political alignment (or where it was prior), to essentially say that he would've been radicalized as well if he were forced to live the way Palestinians are. Regardless of where you stand on the matter; I think that's a super interesting read.",""

**Shuggie Bain, by Douglas Stuart**

Great character development. Relatable, and unfortunately as a result of that, quite depressing. I ended up preferring this to Young Mungo (though that is also great) because it seems more grounded and less melodramatic. Prose is great, and really the only criticism I have in is in the structure of the 'parts' themselves. A year will pass from 'part' to 'part' only for another 6 months-2 years to pass after a simple paragraph break. There was one particular jump that just felt confusing, otherwise it isn't a big deal. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good book, just try to be in the right mood for it. If I hadn't already been horribly depressed, this book would have shot me right down to the floor. 5/5

This didn‚Äôt hit the highs for me that the first book reached, but I still enjoyed it. A much smaller-scale story and a good continuation of the classic.

**Maeve Fly, by C.J. Leede**

This was pretty disappointing after seeing it around for many months. Just a very ‚Äúnot like the other girls‚Äù main character and not a lot of depth to the characters for the most part. Grotesqueness for the sake of grotesqueness.

**Inferno Squad, by Christie Golden**

Incredibly well setup to start, but then it falls victim to similar hurdles of other pre-High Republic and non-Thrawn books. Some bark, very little bite and feeling like not much has really happened by the end of it. A letdown after knowing they story from the Battlefront II game related to this.

**The Most, by Jessica Anthony**

Getting through more awards longlist choices, and this is one of the few that hasn‚Äôt resonated with me. I‚Äôm glad it was so short at ~140 pages, but it‚Äôs disappointing because until around 100 pages in the premise seemed open enough to explore more interestingly than where it ended. Really enjoyed Anthony‚Äôs writing style, though.

**The Mighty Red, by Louise Erdrich**

New Erdrich is still classic Erdrich! I enjoy the way she writes her characters, extremely real and flawed and reasonably irrational in the way they go about life. This isn‚Äôt *really* a mystery story, but you do very much get one that Erdrich pulls the threads at as the book goes on and you get to know and understand the various characters in this small town.

**The City & The City, by China Mi√©ville**

I don‚Äôt know what I expected, but this book kept me unsure of my expectations and grasp on the how the world in the story works for most of it, which was a fun challenge.

Enjoyed the series overall and the last book was certainly a highlight. Ambercombie evolves rapidly through these three books and it was quite a fun journey to see him hone his art and find his style. I appreciated how brisk and fast paced the trilogy was on the whole, though by the 3rd installment the prose could get a bit repetitive and stale at times. Much like the rest of the First Law, >!Last Arguments of Kings remains a subversion of the fantasy genre to the last and, it being the final book, ever more so. The Grimmdark themes do creep up at you through the series and they certainly reach a climax here, completing the disillusionment about the world and embracing the bleakness which, I at least, refused to fully recognize until the end.!<

  
Continuing: Moby Dick, by Herman Melville: Falling in love with this book more with each page I read. Never have I annotated and marked a book so much, even the most commonplace idea becomes a facinating read in the hand of Mellvile.

However, it did suffer from pacing issues near the end, time skipping over some things I personally would have liked more details on and so on. However, despite enjoying it, I feel like I wasn't quite the right audience. if I had read this as a teen, I would have been gushing over it to anyone that cared to listen. 

On the other hand, this could have in part have been caused by already being familiar with the basic plot beats from having played the game, where dramatic moments and basic plot beats are displayed in card art, and details are hinted at in the flavor text.

**Laurent and the Beast, by K. A. Merikan**

Of the few self published m/m romances I've read, this is probably the most genuine romance I've encountered. The others I've read, while good in their own right, suffered from Disney Prince Syndrome: falling madly, deeply in love within the span of a week or month and no fights or spats.

This had a gradual build up of tension between the main m/m couple, which wasn't immediately satisfied until a few weeks of the pair knowing each other. Then it delved into genuine real life anxiety a lot of people experience such as relationship longevity, trust, and potential infidelity. >!They didn't exchange ""I love You""s until a few pages toward the end.!< My only major criticism being quite a few of their spats could have been resolved with communication.

As for the plot itself, it was fairly engaging. A touch of time travel, demon pacts, hellish motorcycle clubs, orgies, and a strong but silent type of guy with a lot of baggage to sort through.

**The Hacienda, by Isabel Ca√±as**

Obligatory spooky season book. I'm surprised how fast I consumed the pages. Good book, on par with some of the more recent horror I've read. I wish it could have been a little more subtle with certain horror elements, had a better build up such as leaving it ambiguous whether the house was haunted or not. However, it made it absolutely clear the house was haunted and alive almost to a cartoonish degree (almost a mix of the movies Encanto and Monster House). Some major characters also could have stood to have been developed further; some only had one or two scenes in the book all together. Despite my criticisms, its a decent read and I enjoyed the more tangible themes it delved into.

I love how Hobb connects the first and second trilogy with details, not making them dependent on each other, instead giving them common references to other folk in the world. She creates amazing characters to follow and I am very much looking forward to starting the next book and trilogy. The level of fantasy is also really enjoyable, with interesting abilities and creatures and how they interact and make sense of the world.

**The Last Murder at the End of the World, by Stuart Turton**

Finally finished this one! Woo hoo! To clarify, the time it took to read it is not at all a reflection of the book itself, but rather a reflection of my mental state over the past few weeks. I found this book to be a pretty easy read tbh, it flowed nicely. What caused me to take so long reading it were purely external factors, not the story itself. I am in one of the worst affected areas of hurricane Helene, and I lost my ability to focus on reading or anything really for a good while there. Trauma's a bitch. But I'm back at it now! Got my reading mojo back! Feels SO DAMN GOOD to be able to read again! I'm happier right now than I have been in weeks! üòå 

In any case, if anyone is interested in how I felt about this book, feel free to comment, and I will give you my review and share my thoughts on it and/or we can discuss it together!

**Slipping, by Lauren Beukes**

Been reading this one off and on for a while. It's a collection of short stories and essays. Not bad, not great, I prefer her novels but when I'm having trouble focusing on the other books I'm reading or when I'm just in the mood for a little taste of something different, I pick this one up and read a story or two. Her story titled Unethi Battles the Black Hairballs, as a massive Haruki Murakami fan, that one gave me some laughs. It was completely unexpected to me to see connections between her work and his! Made me laugh outloud for the first time in a while hehe

Started:

**Till We Have Faces, by C.S. Lewis**

This one isn't in my wheelhouse, not one I would have anticipated picking up if it weren't my wife's favorite book, so I'm reading it out of love for her. Her and I typically have *very* different types of books that we go for, but she requested I read this so we can talk about it together. So here goes!

**The Heart in Winter, by Kevin Barry**

Just started this one too, liking it so far, don't really know much about it but I used to read a lot of historical fiction so it's kinda cool to get back into that after not reading much in this genre for a while. I read Train Dreams by Denis Johnson  some time ago and I'm getting a similar vibe here...hm...

Running commentary:

I feel like I gotta make up for lost time since my reading pace was drastically slowed and interrupted for the past however many weeks it's been now since this hurricane upended my life.  

But hey, I'm safe, my family is safe, and I have books. Severe anxiety and autistic butnout be damned, I suppose I'm doin ok all things considered. üôÉ

One day at a time, and multiple books at a time, is how I'm gonna claw my way out of this rough situation! Fuckin watch me!

**Fingersmith by Sarah Waters**: This was a lot better than I expected, especially the ending. It was just generally very good, I liked it a lot.

**Bookshops and Bonedust by Travis Baldree**: Like the first one, this book wasn't exactly my thing, but it was still very charming. I don't normally go in for anything that advertises itself as ""cosy"" but it was a good palate cleanser.

**Redemptor by Jordan Ifueko** It's been a long while since I read the first book of this duology, but I still liked it a lot. It's a bit too YA for me, but it's a really interesting and refreshing fantasy setting.  

**Girl, Goddess, Queen by Bea Fitzgerald**: So at this point I think it's impossible for me not to end up enjoying a greek mythology retelling, this was a lot of fun. 

Taken out from the library: 

**The Light of the Midnight Stars by Rena Rossner**: Reading this now, I've looked at it a few times in the library and decided I should just try it out. It seems fascinating, it's a historical fantasy that takes a lot from jewish traditions. 

**Sea of Tranquility by Emily St John Mandel**: This just seemed kind of like my thing, I'm partial to some character-driven science fiction stuff. 

**A Thousand Ships by Natalie Haynes**: I'm going to keep going until I've read every single greek mythology retelling in the library, it seems. 

**A Narrow Door by Joanne Harris**: I really like Joanne Harris' books, and this one is apparently a thriller which is cool. 

**The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow**: I've never read this author, but she seems to show up on the covers of other books I like reccomending them, so I assume she's my kinda jam.   
**Four Treasures of the Sky by Jenny Tinghui Zhang**: I'll be honest, I mainly grabbed this because all the other books were hardback and I wanted at least one paperback. It looks wild.",""

I enjoyed The Loney as a Lancashire native, it was cool to read a book set in Lancs, written by a fellow Lancastrian. It was more unsettling at times than genuinely scary but I liked it and will definitely check out more of Hurley‚Äôs work (recommendations are welcome)

After the extinction of modern elephant species due to ivory poaching, scientists discover how to reverse the extinction of woolly mammoths and other animals. Their attempts fail however because the mammoths have no idea how to live in the wild.  Using the recorded memories of the last great scientist to study the elephants culture and way of life they recreate a herd with the memories of the scientist imbued in the matriarch of the herd. They create a vast park in the Siberian tundra and release the mammoths but they cannot eliminate the poachers of the mammoth ivory.

Barr.** I am happy to report that I spent no more on this book (a brand new hardback first edition) than I would spend on any other book in a charity shop.  No animal was harmed and no political hack was enriched by my purchase of this book. (Is it too soon to re-title the book **The Remainders of the Day**?)

Return with Bill Barr to the US of the 1950s, where Christian nationalism was so pervasive that it was not discussed; it did not need to be discussed, it was just in the air..it was *the* culture. But Barr discusses it plenty now (writing in 2021-2) and laments its passing. What has taken its place? No new nationalism, but a fractured nation with a new religion...militant secular progressivism fomented by Leftist, maybe even Marxist, BLM/antifa/CRT/LGBTQ+ running dogs goaded by an elite and overeducated mainstream media.

In short, obvious Christian nationalism and white supremacy unselfconsciously permeate this book. 

The lies and unstated truths are too numerous to be catalogued. The topics ""Halqbank"" and ""Berman, Geoffrey"" do not even appear in the book's index, although he does state (page 266) he regrets not being able to get Ed O'Callaghan into ""his dream job"".

I cannot go on like this. On to better things.

Barr, who has never prosecuted or defended a criminal case in his life, was our nation's lead prosecutor and never seemed to understand how criminal law is supposed to be enforced. But he does know a thing or two about corporate law and his writing about that and antitrust deserve serious consideration. I was also struck by a one-paragraph opinion of his (page 425) about Afghanistan which precisely agreed with my own and that I never heard articulated by anyone who served in the White House.

In a way, I think the book is an important book and it needs to be read just to get a full flush in the face of Bill Barr's thinking. Just, please, don't spend any money on it.",""

Like, the narrator is clearly a massive hypocrite unable to see that everyone else is just as scared and vulnerable as he is, and because he can't see this he hurts the people around him, but I'm not sure if we're supposed to read him as a hypocrite, or if the author genuinely believes ""no, actually, I really am that much more sensitive than everyone else around me and could not have done otherwise in these situations"". I guess that just adds another layer to it, though.

**The Austere Academy, by Lemony Snicket**. Most of the other stuff I've been reading has been either pretty heavy or pretty gloomy (or both), and with was a nice light treat in between.

Started:

**Dracula, by Bram Stoker**. Very fun so far. It's not exactly spooky season in my hemisphere (it's spring, and humid as balls right now), but plastic skeletons and fake cobwebs abound regardless, so I might as well get into the spirit of it somehow.

**The Mongols - A Very Short Introduction, by Morris Rossabi**. I generally like the 'Very Short Introduction' books and other related series. It's like a nice mid-way point between a Wikipedia article and an actual textbook. And the subject matter here is really fascinating.

Ongoing:

**A Brief History of Neoliberalism, by David Harvey**. This was written in about 2005, so naturally some parts of it are going to be a bit dated, but other parts are scarily prescient. Like, he makes a big point of how neoliberal ideology *should* in theory punish bad decision making on the part of lenders who make overly risky loans, but because it is so crucial that the neoliberal state ensure the quality of money and a stable business environment, financial institutions are never punished for their misjudgement in the loans they give, and are instead bailed out by governments whenever they fuck up. Lenders are protectors, so borrowers take on all the risk. Just a few years later, this tendency would explode in the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, and the topic of bailing out large financial institutions would suddenly become a topic of mainstream headlines. Anyway, an interesting read so far.

**The Ersatz Elevator, by Lemony Snickett**. Having enjoyed the previous one, I decided to jump right into the next in the series.",""

And thus comes the series finale for the second time.


But as broken record-like as it is to say there's not much to say here (without spoiling things) as it's still the same at it's core as the first two volumes. But even then, on top of the different perspective on events, this whole side story had new scenes and events and at times told from character perspectives that weren't or didn't get perspectives told from them in the main story proper that kept this one from just treading completely along the same path as the original *while adding* on fascinating new elements to an already established plot. And yeah, it's fun and interesting seeing Claire's fondness for Rei gradually growing and changing as seen from her perspective. I mean you can *really* see the changes in how she speaks to and acts around her as the story goes along here.


But even so. This side story only covers the events of the main story's first half (I.E. the first two volumes of the main series). But even then, for as much as I like the story, even I don't feel that we'd need to see a Claire perspective of the second half of the main story anyways. Well in the end, for fans of the series as a whole this side story ain't a bad thing to look into.",""

I love how much thought goes into the worldbuilding and the social commentary, but I haven't felt that connected to any of her characters so far. Granted, I don't think Le Guin wants us to love her characters exactly -- the MC in Left Hand for instance, is a total sexist IMO -- but that lack of connection means I keep finding myself respecting her work but not loving it.

I have a science background and love science (although I have only basic physics knowledge from intro physics in college, which is the main science in the book), and it does seem like this correlates somewhat with the enjoyment at least of the people I know. I think the big thing is to not get too bogged down in the science if it overwhelms you -- just keep reading! For me, I loved that I couldn't really tell where the ""real"" science ends and the ""science fiction"" begins, since I know very little physics and about space -- this added some extra magic for me personally!

In any case,if I try to be as objective as possible the book still declined a bit in the last 30-40% because sciencing your way out of every problem started becoming way too redundant. Overall I'd say it was a decent 3.5/5","ls4iizy"

There are just so many truly fun moments of mysteries/puzzles being revealed, or incredibly vivid images/metaphors to explain mind-boggling scientific theories. I loved the entire series, and the majesty (I really can't think of a better word) of the ending of the story made me cry. 

There is a strange and cringey bit somewhere in the second or third book about a dude who fantasizes a perfect girlfriend into existence or something, which felt extremely left field and kind of gross, but it never comes up again and didn't ruin the story for me.

I read a load of really bad reviews to see what everyone else thought and was like‚Ä¶ no they‚Äôre wrong actually. I‚Äôm mad at this book but it was still a *really* good read. One of those I wish I could talk about in a seminar or book club because it‚Äôs just so interpretation rich.","ltaalsm"

I had a ton of highlights on it on my kindle lmao. I kind of want to reread it sometime and come up with my personal interpretations of some of the scenes. The first time reading it I was just trying to soak everything in lol. The ending absolutely fascinated me. I could not stop thinking about that twist after I finished the book (the one about the swan, I don‚Äôt want to spoil other people lol).","ltb265m"
