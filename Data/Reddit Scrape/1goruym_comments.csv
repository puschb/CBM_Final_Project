"lwl4bxp","Kvasir2023","2024-11-11 14:47:43 UTC","Douglas Adams kind of addressed this in “Long Dark Teatime of the Soul” with a short digression on why a particular author was popular with publishers- not the quality of his writing but because his name was the perfect size for covers: “David says it’s the first thing any publisher looks for in a new author. Not, ‘Is his stuff any good?’ or, ‘Is his stuff any good once you get rid of all the adjectives?’ but, ‘Is his last name nice and short and his first name just a bit longer?’ You see? The ‘Bell’ is done in huge silver letters, and the ‘Howard’ fits neatly across the top in slightly narrower ones. Instant trademark. It’s publishing magic. Once you’ve got a name like that, then whether you can actually write or not is a minor matter. Which in Howard Bell’s case is now a significant bonus.”

It's well shot, high production value, and well cast. The plot is intriguing, and it sets up mysteries, unanswered questions, and hints at character and plot depths to be explored. 

And then it just...keeps doing that. It keeps setting up mysteries and keeps posing unanswered question after unanswered question, and it never gets round to answering anything. It quickly becomes apparent that there *are no answers*; that the writers were just making it up as they go along and hoping that it works itself out. 

This is also why the Star Wars trilogy was such a disaster. Abrams set a bunch of plots running in the first film without having any idea where he was going with them. He left them to a completely different person (Johnson) to try to resolve them, and when the reception to that wasn't what he hoped he tried to make up another completely different resolution. It's very fitting that Abrams was the one to attempt to resolve it in the third film, and poetic justice that the best that he could come up with was an incoherent mess.","lwnqubv"

I can kinda see an issue if you like to display your book collection; you don’t want ugly, cheesy or otherwise unattractive covers. But you’re a minor market segment so you will not be catered to unless you’re willing to pay extra or it doesn’t actually cost the company anything.","lwmj1lj"

"lwqy9lu","Smartnership","2024-11-12 13:56:54 UTC","I was interested in his early talks where he described the influence of the ‘mystery box’ concept vis-a-vis movie making.


But in the end, it pointed to his biggest problem, focusing on maintaining an unsatisfying mystery that lacks a proper conclusion.

… As well as a lack of solid storytelling within the lore and canon of the relevant franchise.

Examples off the top of my head…


I think it was the second Star Trek movie where he Kirk bemoaning that he was bored with space exploration.  

Breaking the in-universe canon where people can practically transport to anywhere, no starships needed.

With ‘super blood’ there’s effective immortality, bringing an end to most dramatic life-or-death storytelling tension.

Plus his notorious massive plot holes.  


My conclusion is that great writers who know & respect the franchise are more critical than ever.","lwqvof7"

I've not seen Hamilton, but I'm a huge Seuss fan. The problem with writing these openings, though, is that I have a compulsion to finish the entire story. I've written stuff like this that goes on for days. I'm sure you, as a writer, understand my problem.

Plus, I think Seuss hits us just right these days, where we as a society seek simplification, authenticity, and humor. I've seen so many ""adult"" topics transformed into kid-style verbiage lately--either in print or online. From particle physics to cunnilingus...It's like a prepubescent pastiche.","lwy3qx9"
