I was obsessed with that sulky yet idealistic teen boy stuff like the Beats, Bukowski, Celine. Then Hemingway, and onto Richard Yates, Andre Dubus, and Flanbery O’Connor in college. In college I also started reading a lot more about politics and history. Then I went to law school and overnight became obsessed with fantasy and sci-fi. Now I’m in my 30s and read 90% fantasy, sci-fi, and horror and 10% literary fiction. Rarely touch nonfiction anymore. Some would say I regressed, but I think I just matured enough to realize it doesn’t matter what people would say and just read whatever tickled my fancy.

I’m not sure whether these days there are more contemporary books by female authors that are better respected (such as Sally Rooney, Zadie Smith, Barbara Kingsolver) as literature, or they just weren’t on my radar as much back then. In the late 90s, it did seem like male authors dominated what was perceived as quality modern literature and haven’t aged well (D.B.Pierre, Bret Easton Ellis), whereas with a few exceptions, women’s writing was viewed as trashier (Catherine Cookson, Jilly Cooper). As well as that, when I started reading adult fiction, I was steered towards a load of male authors from the 20th century - some great (Graham Greene, Orwell), and some awful machismo beat shit that a 17 year girl had no business worrying about.

Nowadays, I can still enjoy the stories for what they are, but I find myself questioning things a lot more. I've gone on more than one rant to my friends about how certain plot points are nonsensical, or how I hate them sneaking in certain pop culture references, or how certain character tropes get on my nerves. It's also hard not to find most things in certain genres to be very derivative. I can find similarities, and sometimes direct analogues, in most things I read nowadays and sometimes it's hard to get past that.

It does mean that the things that grab me nowadays REALLY grab me and I'll follow them incessantly, but I also find myself starting a book or series that I would have enjoyed in the past, then dropping it because it's just too much like something else, or too childish, or too unfocused, or a myriad of other reasons.",""

"lwy04vc","beldaran1224","2024-11-13 17:10:10 UTC","Of course. My access to books and beliefs about the world have changed, so my tastes have also changed.

Growing up, I had access to less books. The books I had access to were in very specific channels: what my parents already had (reflecting their taste, adult books, mostly older than I by at least a decade), what was in my school libraries (chronically underfunded rural schools, so older) and used books that my parents would buy (again, older books). Part of what this meant is that I'd often read an entire series in a row, it also meant that I basically never read contemporary books and rarely had to wait for a book to come out in an in-progress series. I discovered that I loved fantasy early on, but also read some horror, hated the classic scifi I had access to, and as a teen also enjoyed the occasional romance novel. I also enjoyed a number of other fiction novels as a teens, including historical and contemporary fiction. I read SO MUCH during this time, despite this. I also reread books a lot.

We moved in my late teens, so I got access to a much larger library, but could only go sporadically. My tastes didn't change overly much here.

In college, I mostly stopped reading recreationally, like many people. And after my college years, I was severely depressed and a notable symptom of that was my inability to read.

When I was able to get treatment for my depression and it improved, I also had much more steady access to transportation and more disposable income, as I was able to enter the financial life of a childless adult. This meant I could not only buy books of my own, but I had very easy access to the library. I started reading again, but was so busy for a while that it was mostly some rereads and the occasional other fantasy I'd heard of.

It was about the time that I discovered r/fantasy's book Bingo that I finally had a way to channel my new access to reading material. I dove right in and found a number of much more recent/contemporary speculative fiction than I'd ever read before. Shortly after, I finally started my dream job as a librarian, so I now have pretty constant access to a library that is very large.

So over the last several years, I read my first graphic novels, which I just didn't have access to (other than Captain Underpants, which I didn't feel any type of way about) as a kid. I've really enjoyed exploring that space and have found some truly phenomenal literature there. This includes manga and general graphics, but not comics, which I do not enjoy. I also tried some audiobooks, which overall I don't particularly like, but this is now the primary way in which I consume nonfiction (which has always been a part of my reading, but the topics and perspectives have shifted as my own have...seriously, I was a middle schooler reading very serious philosophical texts about religion and majored in philosophy). Those are two completely new mediums for literature that I've only engaged with in the last several years.

A good deal of my reading over these years has revolved around that Bingo. This has been fantastic in so many ways. But the rules of Bingo are specific. Namely, you can't repeat authors in a year, and you only get one reread. So I haven't reread hardly at all, I'm reading tons of new authors, and I'm trying a wider range of speculative fiction than I was before. I've even found scifi I enjoy! But I've found myself starting a bunch of series I really enjoy and I tend to read the sequels much more separated than I did as a kid or teen, when I read them back to back. It has also introduced me to a love of short stories and novellas.

I still read the same kinds and similar numbers of non-speculative fiction for adults: litfic, the occasional romance or historical novel, some contemporary stuff.

As a children's librarian, I continue to read middle grade and teen books. I also read a lot of picture books.",""

Then I had this kick where I was really into ghost stories. That eventually evolved into an interest in anything supernatural and I think the interest in animals hybridized with that to create an early love of fantasy. That has been the long standing interest for most of my life. 

Also read lots of natural science books: biology, paleontology, geography, ecosystem & environmental sciences, etc 

Got really interested in speculative biology for fantasy creatures (I blame a particular dragon mockumentary).

High school was about the point I got pretty interested in post-apocalyptic fiction. Go figure.

Read lots of creative non-fiction in college and really enjoyed that, but for some reason have struggled to enjoy it since. I think it had more to do with the environment and culture of discussions that fueled the interest. Lots of deep discussion and analysis that scratched the part of my brain that likes to deep dive topics.

A romance that involved a ghost and time-travel was the gateway to historical fiction, even ones not fantasy / supernatural leaning, though those are still my favorites. I've found the only ones I read that aren't fantasy / paranormal leaning usually have lgbtq+ romances.

Similarly, it was a paranormal crime novel that got me interested in similar crime / detective stories. Again though, there's a caveat. I don't usually pick these up unless there is something that sets them apart from what's most common. Recently read one about a veteran with a service dog for PTSD. Really enjoyable read. Was also a romance. I'm starting to see a theme for what temps me outside my typical fantasy preferences. 😅",""

And in my early 20s (so right now) I read a mix of everything (in the same week you will see me reading queer romance and a book about serial killers), but my main category is (Urban) Fantasy.",""

Then, during the last years of high school, I started reading classics because of what we were studying in literature class and as an interest. Going toward university, I was mostly reading nonfiction or good historical fiction, but I made exceptions during summer vacation. When sunbathing and relaxing, a nice light novel is my favourite. That or crosswords.

These days, I read a mixture of everything and try to focus more on good authors than genres, but I have abandoned fantasy. Now, I don't feel like immersing myself in a completely different world, if that makes sense? Like, I don't want the commitment of a big fantasy saga. But never say never.",""

If you have a great memoir by a female author ideally from another culture (but doesn't have to be), that is totally what I love.

"lxopi2i","Secure-Reporter-5647","2024-11-18 01:21:51 UTC","I'm not sure it's my tastes so much as my perspective. I read Breakfast at Tiffany's for the first time at 15, again around 25, and for what I think will probably be the last time at 35. When I was 15 I wanted to be Holly Golightly - she was so glamorous and interesting. It was my favorite book for many years, especially  when I was 25 and I related to her deeply and felt her pain. At 35, seeing now what you don't see as a 25yo woman, I felt mostly sorry for her and furious at everyone around her, particularly the narrator and the men around him for not seeing her as a real flesh and blood human. It's still a great book, but I've now seen Holly from 3 separate angles and have had 3 separate relationships with the story.


I think what I'm getting at is that experiences color how we perceive art, and as perceptions change, so does what you seek out. Maybe thats a change in taste, maybe that's just needing to meet yourself wherever you happen to be.",""

I also like nonfiction and self help/self improvement books. The nonfiction that I read can range from histories to science (especially psychology) or essays - it’s almost always popular nonfiction. I really enjoyed ‘Incredible Journeys’ by David Barrie, which discusses animal navigation and some seriously weird science experiments around it. 

I surprised myself by drilling through a gothic horror novel over the past few days (The Silent Companions by Laura Purcell). I really enjoyed it and was hooked right until the end- she played off the horror and suspense aspects very well and kept me guessing to the end. I always thought I wasn’t really into horror or sci fi, but this book (and a conversation I had with a friend this afternoon) have challenged those notions.
