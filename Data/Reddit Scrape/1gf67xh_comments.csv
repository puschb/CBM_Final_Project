"luf64fl","Radioactivocalypse","2024-10-29 21:48:47 UTC","The main thing I realised having read both Dracula and Frankenstein, was how little of the books are made into our view of what Frankenstein and Dracula are.

Only really the first few chapters of Dracula (finding and entering the castle) and the first few pages of Frankenstein (creation of the monster) have any resemblance to today's appearance.

The rest of the themes, plots, subtext, adventures, writing, locations, timelines... are all just lost. Reading them both was tricky, particularly due to the era they were written. But I'm glad I have read them.",""

Aren't most real lives an immense string of bad decisions after bad decisions? Aren't we all typically coping with our fuck ups by endlessly defending or ignoring them?

"luf9m5v","big-enchilada","2024-10-29 22:07:23 UTC","Yeah, it takes quite a while before Frankenstein gets going, so those early chapters can be boring for people looking for horror right away. And in fact, as you pointed out, the novel is not so much about horror but about responsibility avoidance and failures.

Whose responsibility? Frankenstein's. Human beings. Parents. God. Take your pick. I think the novel is good partly because it can be read in different ways and still provide plenty of food for thought.

Frankenstein may seem like an unlikeable character who doesn't act maturely and refuses to be held accountable, but if you look deeper, that's also what many of us do, in both small and big ways, in our lives. Though we refuse to acknowledge it. It is always others who are irresponsible, not us. That insight I think is the painful lesson of the book for me.",""

No other book has come close to giving me that same vibe again. Of course, a lot of other books have given me a lot to think about and there’s a few I also revere as much as this one. I can also see why someone wouldn’t enjoy it, but the message/idea of Frankenstein isn’t so much “horror” as much as it is about human failure, science going too far, and existentialism. Which, to me, can all be scary in their own way. These books were written in such wildly different time periods, it’s a shame if someone doesn’t read them because they tend to be slow at first.

"luhij7k","Nemo_Zilch","2024-10-30 07:21:47 UTC","In my view, Mina Harker’s character is often overlooked as merely the McGuffin of Dracula, a plot device driving the heroes’ pursuit of Dracula. This interpretation is common in cinematic adaptations and in the minds of many readers.

The depth of her role in the novel is rarely acknowledged. She embodies the theme of women’s desire for sexuality and autonomy while attempting to conform to the rigid expectations of Victorian society.

Her character reflects the tension between purity and suppressed longing, making her far more than a typical damsel in distress. Her ‘corruption’ at Dracula's hands adds yet another layer to her complexity.

What’s interesting is that if you view Dracula purely as a gothic adventure novel, Mina appears as the plot device that drives the men’s journey across Europe. But if you interpret it through the lens of Victorian social critique, she becomes the story’s crucial element, and the men’s adventure becomes the plot device used to explore these themes.",""

I had similar feelings about Frankenstein being a man child but the thing that struck me the most about the book is that the monster... was a monster. In many renditions we are meant to see him as a sympathetic creature but... he isn't really. Yes he is abandoned and mistreated but he resorts to murder... really fast when presented with difficulty. There is a part in the book where he is actually hiding and learning the ways of how to be a person on his own that felt like a huge success but the second he was reminded he was ugly and dejected he was like ""welp i guess murder is the answer"" and that seemed like not the best form of discussing how we learn from our misfortunes lol.",""
"luffrac","SnooGoats7476","2024-10-29 22:41:29 UTC","There certainly would be no story if Doctor Frankenstein did not make bad decisions. I think Frankenstein is an amazing story because it is written so long ago and yet the theme & horror of man playing God or even just unchecked ambition still ring true today. 

And to think Mary Shelley started writing it when she was just 18 in 1818 and we are still talking about it today. 

I think the Universal movie made Boris Karloff’s version of  Frankenstein iconic but the book is still incredibly important to the horror and sci-fi genre. 

I love Dracula too. I just don’t have as much to say about it  at the moment except love the underlying sexual innuendo.

"lugq8fy","MidnightArticuno","2024-10-30 03:05:19 UTC","Dracula had been the favorite of the three classic horror I’ve read in the last three Octobers (Dracula in 22, Frankenstein in 23, and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde this year) because the epistolary format helps move the pace along. Finding the Dracula Daily community also helped me understand the material better. I also really just enjoyed finding the “oh this is the scene!! It’s the classic scene they’ve used in every movie!!” moments.

Frankenstein was….not that experience. The student in question spends most of the book in some life-threatening illness, as if creating the Creature has sapped away his own life force, and otherwise being downright unlikeable (probably on purpose by Mary Shelley) and then there’s so much philosophy.

"lug4270","Just_Me_UC","2024-10-30 00:55:47 UTC","Frankenstein is most glorious when treated as commentary on the excitement - and ambivalence - of the industrial revolution.  It was a time when so much seemed possible.  Galvani's famous experiment using electric current to make the legs of a dead frog twitch was published in 1791, and the secrets of life seemed ready to discover.   The preteen fossil collector Mary Anning found the first Ichthyosaur fossil in 1810-11, highlighting species that were long since extinct.   People were fascinated by scientific discovery, and nature collectors were everywhere.   People went to scientific lectures as popular entertainment.    But false science abounded too - Mesmerism, phrenology, and Spiritualism, for example.   Darwin's 'Origin of Species' was published in 1859, again raising the question of what our place is in nature, and what our appropriate attitude towards it ought to be. In the novel Frankenstein (subtitled The Modern Prometheus, after the hero who stole fire from the gods and was eternally punished), the character Henry Clerval is a foil to the mad scientist, showing reverence and delight in God's creation, suggesting that  we would do better to revere nature than use it to pursue our own ends.  

Anyone who enjoys seeing the complex ambivalence towards science in this period should also look at the paintings of Joseph Wright of Derby.   ""A Philosopher Gives a Lecture on the Orrery,"" ""The Alchemist in Search of the Philiosopher's Stone,"" and ""Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump"" capture the tension beautifully.   Also see ""Coalbrookdale at Night"" by Philip James  de Loutherbourg.

(Note:  my apologies if I've mixed up any details.  It's a long time since I studied this formally, but my fascination with this period has remained strong.)",""

"luhf9u0","sdwoodchuck","2024-10-30 06:44:33 UTC","Michael Bishop wrote a novel that is a de facto sequel to *Frankenstein*, though it doesn't reveal itself to be until around halfway into the book. So of course, it's nearly impossible to recommend to fans of *Frankenstein* because the connection itself is a spoiler. I'm not of the opinion that knowing takes anything away from the experience, though I'll admit that if I'd known going in that was the direction it was going, I would have been very skeptical, because it *sounds* absurd.

For those curious and who don't mind the spoiler: >!The book is *Brittle Innings*. The premise is that it's the 1940's and young men all across the US have been drafted for the war effort. Danny Boles is a year too young to be drafted, and he's a hell of a good short-stop, so he gets recruited to a minor league baseball team, where his speech impediment gets him paired up with the team's other outcast, ""Jumbo"" Hank Clerval. We eventually learn that Hank is actually Frankenstein's monster, who wandered into the arctic at the end of that novel, and wandered back out into North America sometime later. Hank has been trying desperately to live a better life and to be a better man than his creator made him to be--and this takes on a kind of symbolic significance framed by the American South during a time when the country was trying to become a better version of itself as well.!<

I absolutely *loved* Frankenstein and as well as getting the sense it was an incredibly important book while reading, it also turns out to be one of my favourites. The emotional content in that book was chillingly beautiful and heartbreaking as I remember.I found it much better than Dracula, which honestly I found a bit hard to read at points. Had to put it down for a while and come back to it. 

In Frankenstein the doctors flaws are intentional on the part of Shelly as the writer, they’re apart of the book. Where’s in Dracula there’s an undercurrent of Bram Stokers vision of “the Victorian gentleman” shining through, with several counts of absolutely needlessly blasting Jewish and Romani people and lighting them up with strays. That plus the “poor feeble woman trope too”, I’m sure it was amazing and all above board at release but reading it now it reeks of Whit Male Power Fantasy and comes off as a bit lame brained. Very much of the time.

There were many elements I enjoyed in both, and I’m still taken by the idea of vampires as much of the culture is to this day so obviously Bram Stoker tapped into a more powerful archetype there. But that’s what saves it for me. Frankenstein, however, is a beautiful work of fiction  and will likely remain a favourite of mine.

Every page is bristling with things to think about, insights on contemporary science, exploration, political theory, and on and on. And the novel's use of the epistolary form with the limitations of the narrator is brilliant. Consider the passage when the creature comes to life. Victor is telling the story, he thinks the story is about a terrifying and evil monster about to destroy him, and yet, without an outside, omniscient narrator, Shelley lets us see what Victor can't see in his own account. It's brilliant. And Victor's dream of embracing his beloved only to discover she has turned into his dead mother (complete with worms)--great stuff to read and think about.",""
"lvbjbay","halkenburgoito","2024-11-04 08:46:07 UTC","I booked marked this post cause I was actually in the middle of Frankenstien. Now that I've finished, and I had already listened to Dracula earlier this year, I wanted to voice my disagreement. I'd put Frankenstein higher. 

Although I enjoyed *both,* and I thought Dracula had some *really good* highlights, like the introductory chapters at Dracula's castle, with Jonathan discovering himself a prisoner. It was a very thrilling introduction. I really enjoyed  Dr. Seward's mad patient examination chapters, the zoo chapter, and especially the boat/ship chapter where the crew is earlily picked off one at a time. 

I also liked the feeling of this super noble *party* of individuals coming together to take on this great evil. 

*But,* besides those highlights, i felt alot of drag. And especially felt drag after the entire party was onboard with who Dracula was and the true hunt for him began. It dragged and had a lot of forceful connections between the different party members. 

But over all- a fun book. 

  
But I just finished Frankenstein, and I'd put it league's ahead personally. Everything about the book permeates so much symbolism, motifs, and meaning. The exploration of curiosity, reaching the unknowns, playing *god,* and the ramiphications. And then the inherent biase, the inherent guilt ascribed to the monster, automatically. 

And comparing Frankenstien's monster to Dracula, I find Frankenstien's monster to be very more compelling and interesting to read about.

That and I no longer have need of a thesaurus because in just about every sentence the author needed to show off her vocabulary. It's great she knows so many polysyllabic words. Does she NEED to use ALL of them?

I'm reading many of ""The Classics"" for the first time recently and I've found a lot of them are just too verbose. It's like the authors are in love with the sound of their own voices. Shakespeare especially. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow stands out as one of the worst. It spends about 3/4 of the story describing things. Most of which has nothing to do with anything. Its metaphors go on so long you forget what they are talking about. It's easy to let your eyes gloss over and you find yourself skipping over the one verb that actually moves the plot forward.

I guess I subscribe to the John Rogers school of writing. ""What do they want? Why can't they get it? Why do I care?"" Focus on those three things and you're writing will improve drastically.",""

Yeah, so if a character makes too many bad decisions, or if the bad decisions seem too blatant, we regard it as annoying/contrived/unrealistic. It's like half of all novels could be solved by the main character just calling the police. Bam. Problem solved.

But then there's no story. If a character makes no bad decisions, it's boring. There's nothing to read about. 

So, where's the line? I have no idea. I doubt that line could even be defined.

As to your other point about our lives being a string of bad decisions... YES! Yes, it really is! And there's the rub, right?

If someone we're told is smart does something dumb, there's a problem. 

*Dracula* has several scenes where female characters' actions make things worse, but the story is clear that it's because male characters chose not to tell them certain things.

I think the monster tells us he doesn't eat meat. Now you can interpret that how you like but in that mart of the novel he's a good guy trying to do nice things to help people. So you could argue that he knows it's ""not nice"" to kill an animal for meat.

However in the book, she is able to use her vampiric connection to help the group hunt down and kill Dracula.

Frankenstein gets off much worse here. The monster is treated as a lumbering, nearly mindless beast that was ""built wrong"" because the doctor's assistant messed up the brain that was implanted in the creation. However in the book, the monster is made by Frankenstein alone. He is fully intelligent and even teaches himself how to speak and read. He only becomes violent because his creator abandoned him and refused to show him any kindness. And that doesn't even mention how he was treated by the strangers he met.

The main character of Frankenstein is a particularly annoying example because he believes he already knows everything and refuses to learn. Everyone knows someone like him, and those people are often annoying in real life as well.

It is a long used plot device going all the way back to Medieval dream visions, the Canterbury Tales, and the 1001 Nights just to name a few. The Scarlet Letter is another famous example from the same period as well as the poem Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. I like how Frankenstein plays with frames within frames though in a way that is more complex than usual. All these devices have the effect of both adding a sense of realism to the fantastic and on the other hand adding a lot of narrative unreliability as well. The Romantics loved to explore the subjective nature of reality, so this was a useful device for them.","lugjnia"

The creature tries to do everything right with little to no support or resources and is burned by Victor and humanity every time he even tries to just make contact.
