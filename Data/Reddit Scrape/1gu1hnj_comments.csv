I read and enjoyed them all (Moby-Dick was actually my favourite, although I think In Search of Lost Time is the best one), but all of them were serious work. Harold Bloom described reading as ""the search for a difficult pleasure,"" and every one of these books fits that criteria. Ulysses was much lighter than I expected it to be, but I also benefitted from reading the student edition and studying it in class. The Recognitions, Gravity's Rainbow, and Don Quixote were all books that I felt were strong in their overall effect, but on an actual sentence-by-sentence level were a bit of a slog with flashes of intense brilliance. Nostromo has a very slow, boring start, but eventually picks up. Moby-Dick was hilarious and bold and I loved every minute of it. Got it read in about six days.

"ly3e2ul","tillerman35","2024-11-20 13:14:31 UTC","There's a book called ""Little, Big"" by American author John Crowley.  
  
It took me four tries to make it all the way through.  I almost needed five because the last chapter made me ugly cry so much that I had to put it down.  
  
To call the book ""dense"" is an understatement.  Every page is a vocabulary lesson.  Every paragraph has hidden meaning.  The foreshadowing is so subtle that even after reading it many many times since, I still find something that I missed before.  It has ""pre-shadowing"" (a term I made up for when the author drops a hint that's more like a call back to something in a previous chapter than the thing itself is foreshadowing).  
  
There are literary allusions out the wazoo, some so obtuse that they are related only by a description of a thing that appears in the referenced work.  History, pop culture, Americana.  You can't just READ the book.  You have to STUDY the book- and not just the book.  You have to study works that were referenced/mentioned, learn about wildly varied subjects, read other words (including the author's) in their entirety.  Just to understand this one book.  
  
To give you an idea, I have three copies of Little, Big.  One is a 40th anniversary commemorative edition that never gets touched.  It doesn't really count.  Then there's the copy I read.  And then there's the copy I *used* to read.  It has so many notes in the margins, highlighted sections, marginalia, colored tabs, etc. that you really can't just pick it up and read it anymore.  I have to keep it close at hand, though.  I keep finding new literary and historical references to document.  
  
Making it through that book the first time was an definitely an achievement unlocked.  Subsequent reads feel almost the same, especially if I catch something new that I hadn't noticed before.  It's amazingly dense.  Not for the faint of heart, and definitely not for a dilettante.  You'll need some literary chops to read this one.",""

Most of the classics we learn in school should be worth minor achievements, like The Great Gatsby or The Scarlett Letter.

In the same vein, some of the short stories we read should be worth 1 point achievements, like The Rocking Horse Winner and The Destructors.

Modern YA should give kids achievements for getting them into reading. The Hunger Games trilogy and follow up book aren’t terrible, but you should only get an achievement if you’re actually YA when you read them. Ditto for Harry Potter.

I learned Danish with a combination of Duolingo, Danish kids' TV shows, YouTube, Danish newspapers, Danish series and movies on streaming services, etc.  
  
I can read Danish well enough to pick up a paper in Copenhagen and enjoy the news.  But the Harry Potter translation is as complex as the original.  JKR did a lot of wordplay and created loan words from other languages (including Danish- Boomslang skin is a portmanteau of ""boom"" as in ""kaboom"" and ""slang"" which is Danish for ""snake"" - so basically ""exploding snake skin"").  
  
One thing that I think of as an ""achievement unlocked"" is that I can pick up ""Harry Potter og de Vises Sten"" and open it to any random page and read enough to know where I am in the story.  I might not be able to translate every word or parse every sentence, but it's a start.","lxt7vdc"

"ly2pdij","Ice-Nine01","2024-11-20 09:28:21 UTC","Feel free to stop with *Children* if you want; the first three books are kind of the high water mark for the entire series.

Without getting spoiler-y, pretty much nothing happens in God Emperor. The entire book is Frank Herbert monologuing his weird philosophical and sociopolitical views through the mouth of one of his characters.

And as much as I just think some of his views are fundamentally stupid and backwards, the truly unfortunate part is that he repeats himself constantly. He will beat you over the head with the same thought over, and over, and over again. It's 400-600 pages depending on publisher, but probably three quarters of that could be excised without losing anything.

It's not so much packed with philosophy as some people claim, it's really just a small handful of philosophical themes repeated *ad nauseum*.

Maybe Thomas Brezina but that's mostly for really young children.

These are all children's or young adult books but honestly, you can enjoy them at any age. It's hard to recommend novels for adults at that level but I know some novels in English that are easy to read and are for adults, so I'm sure that exists in German too. 

Otherwise I always recommend translations of books that you know and are easy to read as a start, for example Harry Potter or A series of unfortunate events.
