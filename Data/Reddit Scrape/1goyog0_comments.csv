"lwm8no5","CosmonautCanary","2024-11-11 18:19:19 UTC","This might get some more traction over at r/Malazan, which is active and actually accepting of less-than-stellar opinions, relative to other fan subs at least.

I do a lot of audiobooks, but this is one series I could *never* imagine doing on audio for my first time through. I know people do it, and I respect them for it, but I would've been lost as hell. I feel like your CONS 1, 2, 3 and 5 can be alleviated by having the book in front of you and being able to go through a section slowly and reread if you need to. I did that a lot -- my reading speed for this series was very slow. CONS 2 and 5 are definitely stylistic choices and can get grating sometimes. Ian C. Esslemont, who writes other books in this world, is even worse for this haha, basically every single chapter begins how you describe. CONS 4 and 6 are part of the appeal I feel, the world is too big for any one character to be the hero and for all the plotlines to nicely dovetail with each other. The fact that the POV character you spend the most time with in Book 10 is a minor character introduced only in Book 9 is one of my favourite Malazan fun facts.",""

"lwma4ik","MaichenM","2024-11-11 18:26:43 UTC","So I 100% agree that Malazan is, in its absolute best moments, ""good, but not great."" Erikson is a decent writer who is trying to be a great one, and while he has a lot of ambition he fails at some very basic things like characterization and writing coherent action. I can't fault him on his ambition though.

It's funny though, that scene you shared is one of the things that I dislike about Malazan. Erikson, despite how obtuse his books can be, has no sense of subtlety when it comes to his themes, and his characters become mouthpieces for whatever political, religious, or ideological concept he is currently chewing on. This is not *Lord of the Rings*, where Tolkien's meditations on the values of a pre-industrial world are conveyed so subtly through the world's mythology that even the author himself might not have read into it. It's definitely not *Book of the New Sun,* which contains multitudes in all its possible implications and interpretations. Erikson has *ideas*, he knows exactly what they are, and he wants you to *hear* them with neither ambiguity nor nuance.",""
"lwm9ed2","mightycuthalion","2024-11-11 18:23:05 UTC","So for cons 2,4,5 and 6 Erikson is writing a story in a world that isn’t “occupied” by just him. He had a co-creator Ian C Essellmont who has written an entire series of books set in the same world which weaves in and out of the MBotF as well as picking up plot lines that were begun in the Erikson series.

Also the world is very much “lived in” in that there are events going on, like in reality, that aren’t part of the story and aren’t necessarily pertinent to the plot but cause events to happen or characters to react.

The people who like this series LOVE IT for its depth and complexity. It really does seem to stand unique among epic fantasy in that regard.",""

A lot of people will tell me of these other board games (eclipse, void fall) which i could have a ton of fun with and be done with in 2-3 hours and this popularization of a sort of ""efficency of leisure"" has resulted in many attempts at a sort of ""twilight imperium express.""


If we divide everything into the binary of ""had fun with"" and ""didn't have fun with"" then yeah the sentence ""there are other games I could have fun with in half the time"" is certainly true.

Basic information constantly being withheld from the reader was so obnoxious. When the book won't tell you who anyone is, what any of their goals are, what they are doing in a given scene or why and often times a scene will obscure who is even in the scene. When every single detail is a mystery how can I even begin to care? And when you get to the end of the book and the information is finally given it isn't some big reveal it just leaves you wondering why the necessary information to follow this plot point was withheld in the first place. It's either that or the plot thread gets resolved with no explanation at all so that it just felt like a bunch of random nonsense that happened for no reason.

I loved TMBotF and I think it’s infinitely re-readable.

The first book is definitely tough and you kind of have to pick up running until the middle of the 4.3 million words to gain a basic understanding of what is happening.

The Chain of Dogs storyline is the *best* storyline I have ever read. I am getting *feels* just thinking about it. So tragic and so epic.

The world and story is based off of the GURPS tabletop rpg system and around the playthroughs Stephen Erickson and his friends did. Ian Esslemont, another player and friend, did the novellas. All told you can piece the massive world and history together, but it is definitely not your typically fantasy story. These reasons might help you to understand why sometimes things seem to not make sense or why characters did or didn’t do what you thought.

I am of the opinion that it’s fine to not know everything and every perspective in this story. The massive world, history, and plot lines are often not realized individually, much like the real world, and a lot happens “behind the scenes”.

TMBotF is a masterclass in fantasy fiction but requires a developed and mature understanding to get the most out of it. I would describe it as epic high fantasy military fiction.

I love the in world curses (Togg’s teats!; Hood’s Breath!) and so many of the characters are fascinating. Most of the characters you don’t even know their real names and creatures we would classify as orcs or trolls/etc are jaghut or trell or Tiste Andii, and this isn’t fitting either. Probably done because of OGL or whatever that crap is. Technically Tolkien’s estate should just have the rights to everything since his time lmao 

But awesome read, I’m glad you enjoyed it! I was so pumped to see TMBotF on my feed",""
"lwmh4sp","SpeculativeFiction","2024-11-11 19:02:11 UTC","I've read books 1-3, and a couple chapters of book 4. Unusually, Gardens of the Moon was by far my favorite. It had numerous interesting characters on both sides, which raised tensions and stakes, as well as uncertainty on how things would play out. 

The Siege of Pale (and later revelations about it) make me strongly believe the author originally had different intentions and ideas about how the plot would go, similar to Robert Jordan in early WOT books. 

That said, the following books had fewer characters I cared about, and all were mostly on one side. That would have been fine, but for me the tragedy elements were played up a bit too much in book two, and then up to the point of parody (IMO) in book four.

Part of this is from listening to the audiobooks instead of reading them, but the army of insane cannibal corpse-rapists and their opponents constantly waxing on about how tragic it was to have to kill them was so far over the top to me that it simply became absurd, and I couldn't take it seriously, especially with how long it went on for.",""

"lwpem0r","Turducken_McNugget","2024-11-12 05:13:24 UTC","I quit after the first two with the feeling that the author was probably a dick who I would not like in real life. It felt like he writes with contempt for his readers or something. That's my explanation for him being so deliberately obtuse and opaque.

My memory is a little fuzzy after 20 years, but the second book, especially, felt like a complete waste of time. I very quickly got the sense and figured out what the author was going for: >!""I'm going to get you to like this character in spite of the fact that I'm obviously going to kill them and that will show what a skillful author I am."" No, not really. Getting your readers to like a character isn't the sign of a great author; it's usually the bare minimum to get published. And he just used a very simple technique of just having a third party be in awe of that character.!<

>!Lemme give you a different example of that technique in action from Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. If Kvothe alone says ""I'm a genius"" the reader may roll his eyes and say ""sure buddy, sure you are."" But instead we are given the point of view of Devan Lochees, The Chronicler, who watches with awe as Kvothe masters his writing system in minutes, and he realizes that he is indeed dealing with a powerful intellect. That scene does so much to establish Kvothe's bona fides to others in universe and from there to the reader.!<

>!Back to Malazan book two, the real problem is that the betrayal is handled so cack handedly. It reminds me of a friend who got really mad and almost, or maybe did, quit reading Seveneves by Neal Stephenson when!< >!madam president staged her little coup at the ISS with disastrous consequences!< >!because of course she did; it was a stupid character doing the stupid thing they were obviously going to do because that's the only reason for them being there. That's how I felt about the governor character when it was so obvious, based on who the enemy was, that his act of betrayal was never going to result in him being spared. It was all so predictable.!<

>!And then that leaves the subplot of ""our old acquaintance the empress is fucking up everything and I think I have to kill her."" So he goes there and she says something like ""do you really think I would be that incompetent?"" And he's like ""oh, right. Well, carry on then.""!<

Like I said, it's been probably 20 years since I read those so things are fuzzy. But, I felt like the author wasn't a third of the writer they thought of themselves as, the second book felt like a complete waste of time slash heavy handed, clumsily executed attempt at emotional manipulation, that there was way too much work for very little payoff, and that I wasn't interested in reading anymore of his books.

I do sometimes think about revisiting the series, because so many seem to love it, to see if its really as annoying as I remember it.",""

Like you said, it’s a series that demands a reread to get the full experience, but not everyone has the time (or patience) for that.

You've answered yourself why any reasonable person would not use this kind of grading system outside of assessing performance :-)

I think there are two ways to use the 1-10 scale reasonably (sadly they're also quite incompatible with each other) - either you treat the number as a percentile (i.e. this is better than 8/10 other books - this works better when you add decimals), or you use a normal distribution where almsot half of the ratings should fall between 5 and 6, with sharp drop offs as you move towards the extremes (so that only like 1% of books is 10/10 or 1/10).

I like Malazan overall, I think it does a few things remarkably well (especially structurally), but it also really wallows in some of its shortcomings in a way that can be so frustrating. 

I don’t want to sell it short where it does well, but it’s harder to talk about those things without a super in-depth dive into the way it structures each novel and the way each novel fits into the series overall.

Or how a lot of the fight scenes are extremely bizarre and cartoony. Or how extremely awkwardly things like exposition are handled, or one particularly noteworthy scene where Erikson is trying to explain the cultural significance of every mannerism a character is practicing as he does it, and the end result is this scene with *incredibly* clunky prose.

Did I say that the chain of dogs was bad? No I said the end of the book was bad and that the end of plotlines ruined or lessened what came before (Kalam, and the deadhouse plotlines being the worst offenders). But how does the chain of dogs end? With both coltaine and Duiker dying but actually both are just going to be brought back to life. It's some cop out bullshit where the main characters get to have big heroic deaths without actually dying. It kills the stakes for the series and undoes the power of their sacrifice it makes the story of the chain of dogs lesser that these characters didn't actually die. I've never seen a series bring so many characters back to life it is cheesy and lame.","lwn7umh"

"lwmurhu","bigdon802","2024-11-11 20:11:29 UTC","Sure. I’m not bothered by the concept of a 0/10. I’m just saying that we toss around “X/10” all the time as if we’re working off a universally agreed upon measurement, but our understanding of the scale is often different. It just means that questioning someone’s rating of something is pretty flimsy without understanding the context.","lwmtjeg"
"lworh7w","bigdon802","2024-11-12 02:33:36 UTC","Another paragraph, nice. I gave some wiggle room on the American school scores, as 65% is often the minimum passing score(a D.) I’m sure there are school systems that allow a D-(60%) before a F, I just don’t know of them. But those aren’t above average, they’re below average. The average student achieves about 75% of the available points in their classes. ","lwmtjeg"

It’s still not bad and I find it hilarious that you think erikson has a problem killing characters 😂. Loads of main characters die through the series. The reincarnation of the crow tribe is a major element of the powerful figures in that culture. Did you just skim the book?

Either way, you’re wrong. What you mean to say is “I did not like it”

It’s like when people say Taylor Swift is bad. There’s no measurable metric that would show Taylor swift is bad at what she does. Malazan is obviously good. You just don’t like it.","lwo50f4"

If someone says something is a 7/10 I feel like it makes sense to assume it's good most of the time just maybe not the most mindblowing thing ever. 2 points below that wouodnt be some horrifically atrocious work. People just wouldn't often go out of their way to read/watch a 5/10","lwmurhu"

No the chain of dogs is not the end of the book it takes place over the entire course of the book. Did YOU just skim the book? 


No I don't mean the last sentence I mean the way in which the plotline resolves which I just described to you in great detail.


So you've failed to comprehend what an opinion is, you've failed to comprehend a single comment, and you don't even know what the chain of dogs is. You're not making a very good case that you've even read the book. Also you said that my opinion is demonstrably false and I'm still waiting for you to prove that.","lwrfs8c"
