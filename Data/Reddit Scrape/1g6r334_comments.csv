It's a bit of a commitment and I ended up falling behind a couple of times but you can always just catch up. This sounds like an ad lol but I'm not affiliated with the project, I just genuinely really love it and think it really works with the format!

"lsm38je","LoneRonin","2024-10-19 00:19:46 UTC","Despite having very outdated medical science, Dracula feels oddly modern in its structure, characters and values.

Dracula represents the Old World and its fading influence struggling for relevance in changing times - his cape, high collar and medal were what old fashioned European aristocrats wore at the time. He's a Count aka nobility, but his castle is crumbling and he can't afford servants. His power comes not from any personal skill or merit, but from sucking the lifeblood of the peasants dry, his plan for staying alive by buying land in London to continue exploiting the defenseless.

The heroes who oppose him - Jonathan, Mina, Van Helsing, Quincy, are the rising, educated middle class, fighting back with knowledge, science and technology. Jonathan is a lawyer, Mina a schoolteacher, Van Helsing a doctor, Quincy a businessman/arms dealer.",""

But therre def was some drag to it. Particularly after the dust settled and all the protagonists were on the same page as to who their enemy was and began their campaign agaisnt it. it was during those chapters that I felt a lot of drag and the author trying to pair different characters in the group and have them connect emotionally, etc.

"lsmx6y4","flyingjesuit","2024-10-19 03:50:26 UTC","It being told in diary entries etc. is also thematic. A big part of the story is that The West at this time is obsessed with record keeping. The Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution(including the Scientific Method) make observation and record keeping the lens through which Europe sees the world. Dracula is a perfect villain because he defies all explanation. In the first chapter, Harker tells us he went to the god damn British Museum to look up this Noble he was going to be meeting and could not find Dracula’s Castle on any of the maps. Mina Harker’s superpower/main contribution is being able to synthesize the various accounts they have access to well enough that they can track Dracula’s movements and eventually track him down, something this supernatural motherfucker had eluded for centuries. Another reason Dracula is a perfect villain to haunt the British is because the British Empire was the real Vampire, feasting on the resources of the places they colonized, depleting them while strengthening themselves, just how Dracula sucks on the blood/life force of his victims to not only make himself immortal, but eternally youthful and strong.",""

For a villain who makes minimal appearances, the story is still strongly held by the worldbuilding and escalating tension that leaves your mind to imagine the horror. The occasional unreliable narrative also teases you with what's really happening (or not!). No, Mina, poking your friend with a pin would be too easy to explain her neck injury!

A guy goes to visit this castle, finds that it's a run-down threadbare affair (because he's visiting a much poorer country than his own) where the owner actually does all the physical labor of upkeep and tending to guests, and is uncommonly strong for a thin old man. Wouldn't you be, if you were running a whole castle alone, though?

Then, he awakens the old man from his admittedly- unconventional sleeping arrangement, and on seeing the old man looking at him unpleasantly, hits the guy on the head with a shovel and runs.

Then he gets back to England and finds out that, horror of horrors, the old Romanian you hit with a shovel can actually follow you back to your country and seek retribution.
