Robin Wall Kimmerer is another one. A friend gifted me a copy of *Braiding Sweetgrass* a few years ago, and I very much enjoyed it.

I love her perspective on the natural world both from her cultural background as a native American, and her scientific studies as a botanist. After I finished Braiding Sweetgrass, I lent it to my mom, and she actually gave me Gathering Moss for my birthday.

We drink an excellent sherry and talk late into the night, sitting by a roaring fire and staring out across the park. I reveal to Bertie (he asks me to call him that) that I am from the future.

We discuss his recent books on time travel, Martian invasion and invisibility as well as his excellent commentaries on the history of mankind and development of civilisation. I please him with tales of how successful his works have become but he is disappointed that as a race we were still hampered by the same human problems that are so apparent in his time.

We discuss landing on the moon, the human genome, quantum physics, black holes and the Internet. He is pleased to hear about the gradual breaking down of the class structure, the emancipation of women and the fluidity of relationships. But saddened to hear that religion is still exerting a toxic influence on society and that we are not making the progress he had hoped.

We see in the New Year and I give him a tip - to watch out for a certain Albert Einstein - an up and coming scientist with a lot to say. I finish off the sherry, shake him firmly by the hand, bid him goodbye at the doorway then step out into the frosty night.",""
