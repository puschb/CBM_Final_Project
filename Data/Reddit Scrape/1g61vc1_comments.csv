"lsflt2x","aldusmanutius","2024-10-17 21:57:46 UTC","I enjoyed it, although I'm not sure it lived up to the hype (for me, at least). That said, two areas that really didn't work for me (spoilers): 

>!1) The video games being developed in what is supposed to be the mid/late 1990s felt much more like the indie game development scene of the 2000s and 2010s (and Brenda Romero has called out that one of the book's games is a pretty open ripoff of her 2009 game *Train*). Maybe it's a minor detail, and authors can play with technological developments, but for me it read as anachronistic to the point of distraction, like having a character in the 1980s mention social media (although maybe I'm just unaware of what the underground indie game dev scene was like in the 90s). !<

>!2) The period when Sadie is distant with Sam being revealed to be due to a pregnancy/abortion (if I'm recalling all that correctly) felt like a random insertion that didn't earn its attempted payoff. In my experience it read more like retconning than something that had been building all along. !<

But it was a fun read at the time (mostly).",""
"lsfkvy8","Ginkmo852","2024-10-17 21:52:22 UTC","I also was so disappointed by this book. My biggest issue with it honestly is that its marketed as this ""great story of friendship"" when Sadie and Sam (I think thats his name?) are terrible to each other. Their ""friendship"" never matures past the age of 12 when they first meet -- they don't ever learn to communicate with one another or to accept each other as people who grow and change and are no longer that 12-year-old child. And don't even get me started on Sadie's relationship with her professor... ugh. I cringe every time I see this book on a list of ""must-reads""",""
"lsfql50","GrizzlyP33","2024-10-17 22:26:30 UTC","I find it interesting that the book is so polarizing - everyone I talk to either LOVES it or can't believe it's remotely popular. Personally I found it to be ""good not great"" or ""really cool at times and missing the mark elsewhere,"" so I find it surprising that it's so either end of the spectrum for people.

Things I loved:

-Depiction of a creative partnership / relationship that transcends romantic involvement.

-Feeling of being inside the creative development on projects and the growth of a creative business (personally resonated for me a lot as this is my field / path as well).

-Depiction of protagonist on the spectrum.

-Lack of clear resolution - life is messy and unfinished, growth as a person is fluctuating and lateral, and we don't always reach a clear destination.

-The chapter that came after the worst part of the book. It was beautiful and felt like it was on a different level of writing than the rest of the book.

  
Things I was disappointed in:

-Characters that became frustratingly unlikable without aspects of redemption. This is somewhat counterintuitive to aspects I loved, but there's just too much of the book that keeps these characters at odds for dumb reasons, and it would've been far more enjoyable for those to be shorter / less focused parts of the journey. Love that it's a rollercoaster, but we don't need half the book pushing the characters apart over nonsense as opposed to more events causing a wider range of changes.

-The worst part of the book for most people is the more impactful event that comes later on. I didn't dislike it for a lot of the reasons others did, but it did feel forced, oversimplified, shoehorned in, and without a true reason or ""payoff"" for our character's journey.

-I enjoyed the ""Oregon Trail"" section more than most, but still didn't stick the landing to make it all worthwhile.

-The more we dug into video games, the more it was clear the writer was out of her element. A lot of the description of games made no sense for the times and there were loads of historical inaccuracies. I can look past so much of it, but at times it was just a ""what the hell could she possibly be suggesting this 8 bit game is actually doing here??"" Definitely took me out of it at times what was being suggested for these games.

-Overall I liked that the creative relationship / friendship was so far from neat and tidy because that's life (as mentioned above), but it still didn't feel like a worthwhile journey in the end. Felt like there was basically a third act missing, and instead we got this alternate fever dream of a third act that didn't finish the story it was telling.

  
In general I really enjoyed the first part of the book and thought I was going to love it, then really disliked the second part while thinking it would pay off, then walked out feeling unsatisfied and like there wasn't a clear vision and intent in the journey. But the things it did well it did very well for me, and rarely has a book reflected a lot of my creative experiences and aspects of the collaborative journey so well. The presentation of this creative connection was at times wonderful though, and I still recommended the book to my long time creative partner, albeit doing so with a ""lower your expectations enough"" caveat.

  
I think if the book didn't get hyped up so much it wouldn't have so much vitriol in the response. It was an ok book with inconsistent quality, and I'd be fine to stick it in the 5.5 - 6.5 out of 10 range, for me personally.",""
"lsfnvci","Caradhras_the_Cruel","2024-10-17 22:10:02 UTC","I had no idea it was about videogames and was really pleased to discover that while reading. The lesson the woman teaches her class with the game about making factory widgets was such a great demonstration of what games can be as an art form.

I grew contemptuous of the main characters and the choices they make which end their friendship but also thought it was very realistic. That's life - people make bad decisions and live with the consequences. I ultimately decided I like the author's choice to write flawed characters.

It was good, 3.5-4/5",""

Get destroyed by that fact, still reach out years later.  Then also being told by your best friend that it wasn't a big deal.  Maybe not to you Marx, but it destroyed Sam.

"lsguidr","mmbagel","2024-10-18 02:35:20 UTC","I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It took me a little while to get into it, but after about 75 pages, I read the rest of the book in one sitting, and I was in tears. The chapter from Marx's POV was beautiful.  

Yes, the main characters are unlikable people: I actually find their flaws human, and I feel like a lot of people have more difficulty communicating IRL, today, than these characters in the book. I really liked how this book did not end the way >!When Harry Met Sally did. The main two characters did not get together. Why does that feel so revelatory.!<  

Yes, there are a lot of factual inaccuracies around gaming, and the author is not a gamer: one of my friends asked me about the book, and I went off on a random rant about how fighting games are *not* martial arts games. They are not a gamer, and did not really understand my rant LOL.  
But the book really captured the excitement about gaming, and presented beautiful concepts around gaming that non-gamer readers could easily follow.  
I really wish Ebert could have experienced games that made him question his ""are games art, no"" essay. Before he passed, he acknowledged games probably could be art, he had just not experienced it personally. I wonder what he would have thought of Brenda Romero's Train. I really enjoyed how Sadie's version of that was presented in the book. I wish the author acknowledged Train; she did research recently on all of this, did not experience video game history as it was happening live, and did not realize she really should have given credit for this game.  

Yeah, I totally did not think the Oregon Trail section stuck the landing. But I get what the author was going for.  

Was this a perfect book? No. But it was beautiful, moving, and it discussed gaming in a way that felt somewhat authentic, without getting into all the nitty gritty technical details. I appreciate that an author wrote this book, and tried to capture the excitement and passion and craziness around the gaming industry. I like that I would recommend this book to any non-gamer friend.  

I had a very different reaction to the characters from you, OP, but I felt the messiness and difficulty over simple communication was more realistic. Can I respectfully agree to disagree with you? I enjoyed reading your reaction and all the other reactions in this thread, so thanks for that.",""
"lsfk04v","Next_Intention1171","2024-10-17 21:47:18 UTC","I loved it. If I absolutely had to nit pick it I think there’s 1-2 times that she kind of added political ideology (that was unrelated to the already themes being explored) and it came off a bit forced. Overall it’s a 9.9/10 for me.

“The writing and character work overall was good. 

However...

I feel that Sadie was meant to be a sympathetic or even likable character, but her actions and thoughts throughout the whole book are selfish and narcissistic. I had a hard time enjoying myself while she was trying to burn every bridge that her and Sam have built together. 

Every time Sadie had hardship, Sam did his best to overcome his anxiety and be there for her. Yet there are so many examples of Sadie outright ignoring Sam when he was clearly going through difficult times in his life.

This book may have been more enjoyable if she wasn’t such and awful friend.

The references to gaming and world events was nice.”",""

Im a hard-core gamer with a lot of knowledge of the history of video game development so at first the very surface level and often unrealistic and inaccurate views of the industry and the profess of creating video games but at some point that part of my brain clicked off and I started operating in this sort of adjacent universe the book was in (cope) and it became more about the relationships.

Sam and Sadie were just such flat characters. I don’t really feel like there was much growth. Not every book needs to have clear cut or happy resolutions, but I feel like we didn’t know enough about either Same or Sadie in the end to have a sense of any resolution. I also felt like a lot of the conflict never really came to an interesting head. Like it just stayed at a kinda flat level of “oh they’re drifting apart because of some misunderstanding”. 

Throughout the book there were snippets of interviews with Sam and Sadie that were supposed to take place some time in the future, so I was hoping that in the end we would get more of that and get to see their actual individual ideas of what happened between them, so I was a little disappointed that didn’t happen. 

I think there were definitely some interesting parts of the book, but I definitely feel like it was overhyped. The plot felt very lacking, yet it wasn’t lighthearted or emotional/heartwarming enough for me to think of it as cozy read. It was just… fine",""

It is a sweeping epic that will have you laughing and crying at times.

Skallagrigg unites Arthur, a little boy abandoned many years ago in a grim hospital in northern England, with Esther, a radiantly intelligent young girl who is suffering from cerebral palsy; and with Daniel, an American computer games genius.

Till around the halfway point, the book was incredibly moving, sweet and charming and then it just got way worse for me. There were some things I found off putting with the writing, especially now the kids spoke to each other at the hospital but oh well the rest of the first half was great. 

After that, it just got progressively worse although there were parts I found insightful such as how Sam dealt with pain. Marx's POV chapter is still probably my favorite. Everyone else said it was too cliche or whatever but I liked his POV. Although I'm not happy with where his character ended up.

I never really could like or empathize with Sadie after the first half and the whole dynamic with Sam got me very tired of the book.

A lot of the description of games made no sense for the times and there were loads of historical inaccuracies. I can look past so much of it, but at times it was just a ""what the hell could she possibly be suggesting this 8 bit game is actually doing here??""

I read it recently through my work book club where I was the only person old enough to have grown up with games in the 90's. The others enjoyed it and the references to old games they recognized did work for them. So I guess her loosey-goosey approach to this stuff does work for some audiences.

For me though, there were aspects of the book that I enjoyed, but the constant anachronisms drove me up the wall.

Somewhere along the line I just had to accept the whole thing was taking place in a sort of retro fantasy land with only a passing resemblance to the reality of the times (in fairness, in the acknowledgements at the end she more or less admits to doing just that).

For what it's worth, here are some anachronisms that particularly bugged me as I read:

* It alludes to them playing Sierra adventures on her laptop in the hospital in 1988. Now, I'm not an 80's laptop expert but I'm fairly certain they were nowhere near the level to be credible games machines back then.

* They cite Princess Mononoke as a visual inspiration for their first game in 1996. That film didn't come out til 1997, and didn't come out internationally until 2001!

* Sadie is excited about the upcoming Metal Gear Solid and refers to Hideo Kojima as one of the most creative minds in the industry. No one in the west cared about Hideo Kojima before Metal Gear Solid, most of his games weren't even released outside of Japan!

* One of the students in Sadie's 1994 game design university class (which also wouldn't have existed back then) writes a letter to the lecturer about how she felt the class was no longer a 'safe space' after playing her game. No one was talking about 'safe spaces' in the mid-90's, that's classic 2010's language!

* Similarly I feel like the controversy about their Ichigo character being gender neutral would not have been a thing at the time this story was set. If the character had been a girl and was forced by the publisher to be a boy, *that* would've been very plausible. But non-binary gender stuff really was not where people's heads were at either way, particularly in the gaming world.

In general, it's very hard to imagine the sorts of games they were making being mainstream hits in the late 90's, they most likely wouldn't even have been made. People were not generally making conceptual artsy games where the creators started out by discussing what emotions and themes they wanted to explore. And if they were, they weren't topping the charts doing that.

She could've solved so many of these problems by setting the book during the indie game boom of the late 00's/early 10's, where most of this stuff would've fit okay. This is basically ""Indie Game: The Book"", but she made the mistake of setting it a decade too early.","lsfql50"

Then out of nowhere it just throws it out there that Sam had had one male and several female sexual partners in college years earlier. A hitherto-unmentioned old flame is suddenly introduced as a character, and then disappears from the book as quickly as she appeared.

Sam's whole characterization in the book up to that point had been as this neurotic, isolated shut-in with exactly two friends, one of whom he relates to almost entirely through gaming, and who only really comes to life socially in his 20's when taking on the role of public figurehead for his games company.

They're all technically ""intelligent"" people, but Sam and Sadie specifically have...variations on a God complex from a combination of factors (past experiences, their intelligence) that are pretty well-articulated in the book. My memory is hazy, but I think Sadie acts like a ""pick me"" at least in the beginning, probably throughout the entire book, and people were criticizing her for that. But like, that's her entire character lol. She sucks. Sam sucks. I spent the entire book debating whether I hated Sam more or Sadie more, and concluded that they both just sucked. They didn't grow throughout the book because many people don't. I mean, how many older adults do you know with very rigid ideas and unchangeable personality traits that remind you that age is not equivalent to wisdom? Perhaps for some people, that's the only way for them to not drive themselves crazy with regrets.

I agree that the ending was uncharacteristically happy, but for most of the book, it was fairly clear to me that Gabrielle Zevin didn't actually endorse the behavior of the characters. Idk it's fine to not like the book, but it's important to not misunderstand it.

Also maybe it's been a while since people have been in college...but college kids are idiots and miscommunication is basically 90% of at least half of their relationships with each other lmfao.","lsfspv1"

I think it's less about an accurate representation, as opposed to random details that could not have happened. Like u/aldusmanutius pointed out, he thought the game development detail was more reflective of the early 2000s, even though the book was set in the 90s. Also, there was the reader who mentioned the author described the current Austin airport, when back in that day, that airport wasn't around. As someone that didn't grow up or live in Austin, that really doesn't affect my experience of the book (this is fiction, people).  

I didn't read this for a 90s game developer's factual POV, or for the factual POV of someone who grew up in Austin in the 90s/00s. I suspend my disbelief for much bigger loopholes and plot holes in movies (especially superhero/anime/geekdom movies) ALL the time.

It uses the same concept — and even the Nazi theme — and assigns the idea to a main character to show how brilliant she is. The way the player would interect with the game is very similar, and it has the same big reveal at the end; only some details are changed. The person I was talking to recognized it as “Train” before I had even finished describing it. (eta: the game is well-known in gaming history, even though it was purposely never commercially distributed.) The novel also makes it that the fictional character came up with the concept years before the real game was invented. (An irritating habit of authors: “Lessons in Chemistry” is another recent example: the main character hosts a cooking show a few years before Julia Child did hers.) 

The creator of Train, Brenda Romero, was [not happy about it.](https://wapo.st/3UdidMD) 

“‘I put everything I had into making ‘Train,’ and there are people out there who think that this was her great work and her great idea,’ …She added that she found it ironic that one of the themes of ‘Tomorrow’ is how women struggle to get credit for their work.”

I also feel that there's an element of *BoJack Horseman* in this book, as you can sympathise with the main characters and want them to do well, but they are people with a strong degree of self-destructiveness that isn't helped by their fame and aspirations in a creative industry.

Sam was jealous and blamed Sadie, both of which are horrible, while Marks said ""Sounds like a personal problem for them to solve, I'm not getting involved."" 

Even the way later on Sam assumes she did it for herself and Sadie remembers it as a terrible time in her life, its sort of given an ""Oh that's OK"" because we are told Sam didn't know, which is just shifting the blame to the abuse victim for not ""speaking out more.""

It also is reduced to a punchline by the end of the book, which I can't imagine is funny if you are a victim.

"lsh9v8l","laowildin","2024-10-18 04:30:38 UTC","Thank you for articulating all that. The other character reactions, and the lack of any real flaming justice -which i believe should be required as heinous the abuse in the book.

Sadie is more realized of a character for that arc, I agree. But there can be other arcs, and I think its a bit gross to go for that one so hard. It's basically the same criticism I have for Rabbit, Run","lsfyvej"
"lsk7qb7","monbeeb","2024-10-18 17:50:18 UTC","To me it almost seems like the story was originally written that way, but got moved to the 90s in a later draft. Would've made way more sense.

"lsnfr9w","TantumErgo","2024-10-19 06:50:08 UTC","She isn’t passing it off as her own: it’s a character and setting moment that a *character* comes up with this game, presents it blind to a group, and they react.

If I wrote a story set in the 19th or early 20th century, had a character invent a game in which you go round and round buying up all the property only to discover it stops being fun because one person eventually owns everything, and then another character retools it and markets it as a fun game for families to celebrate capitalism, that wouldn’t be plagiarism and I wouldn’t be claiming to have come up with the Landlord Game myself. I could use it in the story as part of showing who my characters are, and what context they are working within.","lsnf1nx"
"lsj9m1l","sadworldmadworld","2024-10-18 14:50:29 UTC","That's the thing though, it's not a *trope* in this, because it's not miscommunication just for the sake of creating drama and angst to make the resolution feel worthwhile or increase page count (e.g. a lot of times in romance novels). The drama and angst come from the characters being insufferably self-centered idiots with many layers of insecurities and superiority complexes, which is what results in all these miscommunications and series of them talking around/at each other instead of *to* each other. Like the entire point was that despite the characters being very successful and driven and cool, they're actually deeply flawed individuals who are fairly maladapted to society. Miscommunication is a natural result of this.

Totally fair to wish it took a closer look at the early game dev industry though, can't really speak on that and I didn't really pay attention to the marketing for it, so idk if they made it sound like it would be more accurate/the focus. It does read like a character study with gaming as just the backdrop.","lshx1h1"

"lsg2sxf","CorpCounsel","2024-10-17 23:42:23 UTC","Sam is an incel in that he doesn't ever see Sadie as a person but instead as someone he can make use of. Whether its crushing on her, or getting help with his game, or just someone to talk to, he never considers her as a person but only as how she relates to him.

But that is kind of my problem with the book - none of the characters are people, they are just a couple hastily thrown together character traits.","lsg0zm3"
"lsgafmg","Sgt_General","2024-10-18 00:28:50 UTC","I don't think that the book treated Sam and Sadie equally and that's why people will be inclined to hate Sadie more. I found myself falling into that same trap until I asked myself if the text is unfair to Sadie.

When Sam disappears from work due to his phantom limb pain, we see it from Sadie's point-of-view and it seems annoying, unfair to Sadie, and mystifying (albeit all the more frustrating because Sadie is too busy being mad at Sam to ask about what he's going through). Then we move onto Sam's point-of-view and we become more sympathetic towards him because he's going through a lot of stuff and isn't good at communicating this.

When Sadie disappears from work due to grief, pregnancy/giving birth, and post-natal depression, we see it from Sam's point-of-view as he's the one with agency, trying to hold Unfair Games together while emulating Marx, and we seem to lose access to Sadie because Sam is denied access to Sadie. All we see are her mean, bitchy, grief-stricken comments. When we do get a chapter about her during this time, it's focused on her playing an MMORPG as a form of escapism while refusing to engage with the real world. By the time she's back in the narrative like she was before, the book is nearly over.

It may be that someone - or multiple people - felt that occupying Sadie's headspace in the real world during her worst time didn't help the narrative, but either way it left the book feeling imbalanced to me - and I say that as someone who enjoyed it.","lsg0zm3"
"lsnk01g","Lifeboatb","2024-10-19 07:38:24 UTC","Funny you should mention *that* game in this context! But I can’t tell from your description exactly how you would use it, so I don’t know if it’s a parallel to what I think happened here.

It depends a bit on how you define the word “plagiarism,” but the person who started this thread seemed to think the author had created this great example of how games can be art, as I did initially, and I think it’s kind of lousy for an author to let people think that, when she used someone else’s concept. Obviously authors aren’t going to come up with 100% original ideas, and they don’t need to in many cases, but in this case, the whole point was that this was a brilliant new idea, and the character (and by extension the author) gets recognized for her groundbreaking brilliance.","lsnfr9w"

Consider the huge number of references in the Discworld novels: nobody expected to be taken seriously if they went around accusing Pratchett of pretending to have invented these ideas, even if people unfamiliar with them might have mistakenly thought he did. And equally, you didn’t have to understand the reference to understand the role the ideas took in the stories, most times.
