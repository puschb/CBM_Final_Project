There's a deep connection here between the economic pressures that produce so many broken people and so much homelessness among the not-yet broken, the economic decisions that weaken our schools, the ever-increasing economic rewards provided to the ever-increasing rich, the fear and hatred sown by the idea of a you-win/I-lose economy in the fields of workers and wage earners, pitting them against one another, and other signs of civil and social disintegration amidst plenty that I don't have the skill or knowledge to connect.

While I understand what you're saying, as a Librarian I actually disagree with you.

I think that it is important that libraries adjust with the times, and in major US cities they are seen as a hub for reaching any number of resources and I actually think this is a good thing. What we need, though, is administrative support on streamlining how we can help and strong guidance on how best to do this.

For example, my system employs a few full-time social workers. These people are tasked with both doing outreach to patrons and serving as a liaison between the library system and other local resources.

Ultimately I have zero qualms with the expansion of the role of the job, I just want there to be institutional backing of us in facilitating how we can help rather than us just being expected to figure it out on our own.

The problem is that the original mission of a library is completely out dated to modern needs. It used to be the primary way of getting information and conducting research*. With modern Internet, digital lending platforms, why focus on physical books? 

It's clear that we need a better concept of a community center to engage with our modern problems. I think the library tried to be this center but for reasons mentioned in the article and comments it's just not doing it.

But we had a lot of people who needed help, including a guy who went on to stab a Walgreen's worker. My takeaway is that it was probably a disservice to both him and the victim that he wasn't forcibly given a mental health evaluation and treatment after all the smaller assaults that took place prior at the library.

We even had a homeless lawyer who did traffic tickets from the library in urine-stained tights that stunk up the entire floor. I never understood why she wasn't getting the small amount of help she probably needed to get back on track. But she was kind of proud (despite the state in which she came to the library), so maybe we were actually the closest thing to the government that knew she was homeless.

While there are definitely people who can be helped by throwing money at them, they are able to blend in. They aren't straining library staff or resources. But to really help the issue, the money needs to be thrown at non-abusive asylums that can help people who need other help in a personalized way while giving them somewhere semi-permanent to stay (and permanent as needed in some cases).

The government would also need to be re-empowered to keep and treat adults in a facility against their will in some cases, such as the guy confusedly assaulting people at the library.

Libraries exist because most homeowners feel like the $80-$200+ they pay per year in taxes for the library is worthwhile. 

If you try to convert libraries into drug rehab centers, people will stop supporting libraries and the money will dry up.

A significant percentage of homeless people are mentally ill and struggle to maintain a living space... one of the reasons many people are where they are is because they are unable to keep up with the requirements of society, such as paying bills and keeping a house liveable.


Just giving people a house is, for many people, just a recipe for a lot of damages property... even with the best intentions of the individual. People WANT to live in nice places, but when your mental illness or addiction consumes your life, keeping your kitchen clean and taking the trash out falls to the wayside quickly. It can be even more distressing to live in a place you can't manage.


There are MANY people on the street who need daily oversight, though they do not need institutionalization. It needs to be done with respect and with the interaction and input of the individual. Unfortunately, we don't have enough social work funding for people dealing with the most extreme situations, let alone those who can get food and manage to find a place to sleep at night. 


It's a truly horrible situation. So many people go unseen and unheard, let alone unhoused. The biggest change we need to make is funding for social work en masse, paying people more and having many more people so there is less burnout and less caseload.

Libraries, public parks, public transit, etc., are for the use of the whole public (yes, including homeless people), but what they are absolutely *not* for is to be monopolized by a small fraction of people who make them inhospitable and/or physically dangerous for others.  These spaces being dangerous doesn't just hurt the employees or the well-heeled patrons who can go elsewhere or use expensive private services instead.  It also hurts the other people who *need* these places, including people who rely on these services to find or hold down work, people (including kids) who rely on them as temporary refuges from unsafe homes, and even other homeless people who rely on the internet access, bathrooms, and heat/AC and don't cause problems.   

People should not have to run a gauntlet of drunk homeless men shouting verbal sexual abuse and constantly wonder whether any of them are going to make a grab or try to push them off the platform to get to work.  People should not have to worry about their kid stepping on used needles at the park.  Library patrons should not have to worry about creeps watching porn and masturbating at the public computers.  Librarians should not have to worry about cleaning up human waste, being threatened by junkies, or finding dead bodies in the bathroom. 

And an individual person who needs to access these services should not have to wait until state and federal governments fix monumental issues like housing and mental healthcare in order to be free of violent, antisocial people ruining community spaces for everyone.

One of the reasons that I am a proponent of increasing the delineated services offered at the library is at least because I work in the system of a major city and both see the need and want to ensure that the library continues to serve as a hub and open space for all people. One way we justify our continued existence is by providing services relevant to the community beyond the collection. It's the same reason we offer lecture series, game nights, and other events that aren't just book clubs / loaning people materials. 

I'm not saying that we should handle caseloads like a social worker, just that librarians should be trained in how to best offer referrals and connections to other city services. 

And fuck the losers who downvoted my prior comment: you can disagree if you want, but I am a librarian of over a decade so if you want to disagree with me write a response (like /u/-Release-The-Bats- did) instead of being a coward.","luw4q9c"
"luy6pob","robotnique","2024-11-02 00:49:04 UTC","I respectfully disagree. I think you're harboring the notion that somehow this will increase the number of homeless and/or drug addicted persons within the library. That simply isn't the case because they're already there. 

I had one gentleman who needed my assistance with completing a rental application for a nearby apartment. Totally falls outside of my job description and I have no obligation to help this guy access his W-2 online and the like. But I went above and beyond and was paid back in the best possible way: I rarely saw him after that because I'd already helped him to secure employment and between that and having his own place he wasn't stuck sitting in the library all day. 

The library has become more and more of a general purpose community center in the past 8 years but I don't feel that it has inhibited us at all from still fulfilling our traditional purpose of lending our media and having educational programming available. We haven't lost our story time to instead have junkie-nod-out-in-the -meeting-space hour. 

If anything, our increased relevance and utility in the community has only made us more indispensable. 

I do understand your trepidation, though. It's not like I haven't read the yelp reviews where some people feel like the library has been ""overrun"" by homeless people. I work hard every day to try and meet the needs of the less fortunate while at the same time preserving a positive experience for your average patron. Sometimes this involves being ready to call the local crisis help team for a mental health issue, sometimes it is make sure patrons are aware of the available study rooms if another patron is being disruptive but not yet to the level where it is time to ask them to leave.","luxv86b"

Plus I still don’t understand why they enforce artificial wait times on them. Sure you can borrow an e-book for x days and then it automatically returns to the library. That’s just normal library behavior. You’re supposed to do the same with physical books you borrow.

But while a library might only have a couple physical copies of a book they can have unlimited copies of an e-book!

All the same can be said for audiobooks! Hell most of the library apps have you stream audiobooks, rather than actually downloading them to your device. I don’t see a wait list on Spotify or Apple Music!

Then, with my library anyways, I only get 4 or 5 borrows per month through Hoopla. At least I can use Libby for unlimited borrows. (As long as I don’t have more than 11 out at the same time.) Which is fairly reasonable on Libby’s part. Most libraries won’t let you just keep taking books out if you don’t return the ones you took out previously.


Except Libby has exactly 0 of the books I want. Or it has the last half of a series, or the first and last 3rd of a series but is missing the middle.

There are many people who probably could stay housed if we removed a lot of the up front costs associated with deposits and application fees and all that. For those people, rapid rehousing with minimal support moving on would be phenomenal and probably changes their lives.

For many others, whether because of addiction or medical issues, they will never really be able to be fully independent. The struggle I have is that even these people have a wide range of capability. I'd love some sort of spectrum of supportive housing. Some folks would probably do best in a retirement village type setting, where they have their own room but are supervised around the clock by trained staff. There are some people who will probably never be able to sustain themselves fully, but maybe just need occasional checkins and help with certain tasks. Someone like that could probably have an apartment of their own and get by okay with support. Others would be able to eventually, but need some coaching. 

We had a lot of people come through our service who had grown up homeless and so had never really learned a lot of the basics around cooking, cleaning, and basic maintenance. It was so sad when we'd have someone like this come through, get housed, sustain it for a while, and then fail just due to a lack of life skills because so many programs just abruptly cut off the second the emergency ends.","luwc77r"

**Housing + Healthcare** first is what I think the path forward needs to be. If we have to choose one to be ""first"" then sure housing is probably easier and more cost effective, but I think we need to recognize and insist that these are two halves of the same coin. We need to keep a roof over people's head, their prescriptions filled, and enable them to see a doctor, dentist, optometrist, and therapist for yearly checkups and preventative care. This I think would prevent a huge amount of falling through the cracks and suffering that exists in the current system - many people would never be homeless in the first place.

Of course for people who are homeless now and in bad shape the path to recovery is longer, we need to build out more and better addiction recovery services too.

 I've worked with someone who's worked in our state's biggest library, situated downtown in our biggest city. On her first day, a woman was sexually assaulted outside the main doors by a group of teenagers. They have to deal with people nodding off (from opioids) and people disrespecting the rules. It's a different population with different needs. 


 Our county is less wealthy but that wealth is more evenly distributed. More working poor, working class, middle class folks. We're also situated within walking distance of a workforce center, and have homeless services volunteers who come in multiple times a week to help folks find housing and care.


 My point is not every library is the same. Not every place is being terrorized by people breaking the social contract, but not everywhere feels as safe and respectful as my county, either.


Edit: no librarian would support child free libraries. Absolutely not. There aren't enough places for low income parents to take their kids, and the people who come in are showing so much care for their child's well-being. They read to their kids, play with them, get them into programs. It's a net benefit for our society. We love them and would never want to put them out.

If libraries could just issue unlimited digital copies why would anybody purchase a new book? The way it currently works with my system and how it contracts with Libby is that we pay for a certain number of licensed copies to loan out over a certain period of time. 

Hoopla works a bit differently in that the libraries pay for the ability to lend out an unlimited number of licenses but limit their users to a certain number of loans per month since they pay a fee for each digital copy leant out (a lot less than the cost of the same number of physical copies but still not $0). The systems still have to pay the vendor for initial access to those ""unlimited"" digital licenses, though.  In my experience this normally leads to systems with Hoopla having a smaller digital lending library.

I got a bunch of free narcan through Harm Reduction Circle (I think, they might have directed me to another program, good source of info though) a couple years ago back when I used to actually go out and hang out with friends. I've also gotten it free from a booth at the Farmer's market, but that time I only took two (to replace the 4 or 5 I'd given away). I carry one in my purse, one in my car (though I don't think that's recommended during extreme temperatures) and keep one in the bathroom cabinet and another in the drawer.

I'm not sure where your system is located or what your customer base looks like in terms of those you provide services to, and how you'd approach this would be very different based on that. For example, a midsized suburban system is going to be very different from mine, which is inside of a major metropolitan area.

In the case of my system, the barrier of access for the library is simply nonexistent compared to getting in to, say, see somebody at HUD (housing/urban development). The people who need to see somebody there 

A) don't know that the services are even on offer and 

B) don't know how to prepare themselves to even access those services.

What I'd like is for Librarians like myself to be able to provide our patrons with something that goes a little bit beyond just a referral.

For instance, my library system provides a passport service. Does that mean that we actually take the applications and issue passports? No. What it means is that we can assist our patrons in having the application completed, having the photos they'd need ready to go, and for us to have provided them with the relevant checklist of all the things they will need to bring with them in order to ensure that they are able to successfully complete the process.

Similarly, we provide the manuals / study guides for the test at the DMV to get your license. We also have printouts explaining what documents they need to bring in terms of ID and the like, and can assist in making sure they have or are able to get their ID if they don't have it.

I suppose you could boil it down to my belief that we need to do more than just be a place to refer you to somewhere else, without taking over the jobs of the people who work at the places we refer our patrons to.","luwbopj"

They definitely take things like that into consideration here when they design the spaces (nowhere with a public terminal has any kind of semi-private space where one would think they wouldn't be immediately seen). 

Honestly I've had very few issues with our homeless patrons as by and large they want to be left alone and, more explicitly, don't want to cause any offense that would get them kicked out. Because of how vulnerable they are they are often actually the most polite patrons. They're also the ones you get to know best since they are often there more than the staff. 

It's the patrons with mental health issues that are most frequently an issue, and they're spread across both the homeless and ""regular"" patrons.

Your typifying of people as ""junkies"" tells me we probably have very different outlooks on a few select issues.","luxjrl6"

You literally said that though. You said library patrons should be helping to take care of the homeless people in the libraries. Everyone can read that, so not sure why you’re lying there as well.

“If you’re not scared by the article,” nice to see you’re keeping that condescending attitude up! Lying and trying to deny problems exist when everyone can see it with their own two eyes is not a great strategy.","lux29i1"

… yes, I chose the word to signal that to you.

Do you think I am not familiar with the arguments for using “unhoused” vs “houseless” or even “homeless”, or incapable of rattling off a grad student copy-pasta on how “harm-reduction strategies and mutual aid networks are an insufficient but necessary bulwark against post-Reagan-era neo-liberal outsourcing of mental health resources, particularly for marginalized persons who have been caught in the pincers of an ever more predatory late capitalism, whose reactionary-bourgeois stigmatization of substance use stands in hypocritical contradiction to the malaise and alienation it itself has engendered in its subjects”?","luxl9gv"

Which, I might add, I should not even have to reply to you about any of this as my original comment was not even about what was happening in the libraries. It was about increasing stigmatization by not pointing out that most people who struggle with these health problems never turn violent. Just like immigrants should not be stereotyped as violent if some are. 

I am sorry if I was not clear in my comment, but it is difficult for me to reply to you, as we are clearly not on the same page in terms of what I said. I am not going to reply to you anymore.","lux3b6j"
"luy4qil","robotnique","2024-11-02 00:36:36 UTC","It **is** my concern, and a hugely discussed topic within the field. 

I think it is inevitable that the role of a librarian in city public libraries is bound to change, and I think we should be very intentional with how we adjust our functions to meet our patrons' needs.

Example: all the libraries in my city serve as emergency shelters when the temperature reaches a certain inhospitable level, albeit only during our standard hours. The city then offers bussing directly from our door to the night shelters. 

The librarians help to facilitate counting up the number of people who are going to be in need of transportation and help answer some basic questions about the shelter and possibly assist with any paperwork that might be useful to have, like filled out applications for a photo ID that they can then go to the DMV with all their ducks in a row so they can take hook up with resources and not bounce off because they came unprepared.","luxvvt3"
"luxzypk","pocurious","2024-11-02 00:07:03 UTC","It’s totally lost on these people, which is part of what’s frustrating about it.

Public institutions are increasingly staffed by people who want to transform those institutions into things that the public doesn’t want and won’t use, with the inevitable result that Republican (or Dem, frankly) politicians, sensing waning public support, will gut them and redirect the money to corporations run by their donors. And when that happens, these people will do a shocked Pikachu and be entirely unable to understand what role they played in this. ","luxvvt3"

I just sensed a bitterness when talking about those unfortunate folks. And I can understand what fuels that bitterness. It isn't like I haven't felt that at times, too. I just try to be empathetic instead because that bitterness is just no good for your own health.","luxwcv0"

"lv4chec","Silly_Somewhere1791","2024-11-03 02:37:00 UTC","Yeah, there comes a point where, as public tax-funded institutions, libraries actually do have to serve the purpose they’re being funded for.

"luy9ybv","pocurious","2024-11-02 01:10:22 UTC","I don’t know how many times you have had this debate before, so forgive me if this is obvious, but I think the typical objection here is: a) the empathy and the bitterness are linked, insofar as the bitterness emerges in response to short-sighted empathy-driven policy decisions and b) at a population level, the negative health effects of unreflected “empathy” vis a vis homeless drug addicts are significantly greater than those of bitterness, insofar as one group seeks to expand the public’s exposure to to them and the other seeks to limit it. ","luy3d5r"
"luxntei","UglyInThMorning","2024-11-01 22:54:00 UTC","It’s this thing where empathy is reserved for the worst off and not for the people who are hurt by their behaviors. The homeless have things outside of their control that got them there, yeah, but that does not mean that they should take priority over the people their disordered behavior is harming. Mental illness isn’t you fault but it is your responsibility. If you aren’t able to take responsibility for your behavior because it’s that severe, you need to be institutionalized for your own good and the good of people around you.","luxgbq9"
"luygxcs","robotnique","2024-11-02 01:56:46 UTC","I don't think I've had too many debates about it, per se, since generally my coworkers and I share values and as such just casually agree on the broad strokes and normally don't dive into the specifics. 

I have some emotional investment in the topic as a librarian *and* a recovering heroin addict, full disclosure. I didn't fit your typical profile of a junkie as I paid my bills, showed up to work, and until I really fell apart near the end nobody seemed wise to what I was doing. 

So I just know the mentality of a lot of addicts, albeit my rock bottom was a hell of a lot less intense than that of many people I've met. I know that they largely want to be left alone and to not make a scene because that equals trouble and trouble means you can fuck up what lies between you and that next angry fix. 

I do think it helps me to relate to some of my patrons so I can communicate with them that I care about them but also need certain things from their end to make sure that the library is a welcome space for *all* people. 

I think a lot of people can't understand the homeless population because it is either just so far out of their own learned experience and/or because most of the chronically homeless are, in my experience, suffering from intractable mental health issues which are ultimately the reason why they can't keep integrated into mainstream society. 

And I can let go of that bitterness because, fuck, I know that they absolutely hate their lives. There is just about nothing I could do that would make their day just that much more miserable. What's the point of me being embittered? Now there are just two of us having a shit day, whereas a small gesture from me can probably make a big difference in his day toward making something better. 

And, I feel that my efforts are ultimately trying to limit public exposure as well through harm reduction. It's why I think things like needle exchanges and readily available Narcan are a good thing. Some people argue that you're just promoting these activities, or ""expanding the public's exposure"" to it but I don't think that's true. Ideally those kind of efforts may make it a bit more visible to those who might have been otherwise unaware but I think it also makes it a lot less likely that you're going to come across a body. 

Sorry, I know at this point I'm just rambling and have left the focal point of what we were discussing, but I hope you're picking up at least a little bit of what I'm putting down.","luy9ybv"
