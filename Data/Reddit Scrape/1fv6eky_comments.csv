You can find more information on the Banned Book Compendium over here: https://www.reddit.com/r/bannedbooks/comments/12f24xc/ive_made_a_digital_collection_of_32_classic/ Feel free to share that file far and wide: bonus points if you can share it with students, teachers, and librarians. :)

"lq5t9vq","drfsupercenter","2024-10-03 16:39:31 UTC","Well, if you call it a ""book ban"" then it sounds bad, sure - but obviously public libraries don't have the space, or budget, to buy every book ever written.  So they have staff (librarians, probably?) who choose which titles to buy.  They also remove and replace old/worn out/damaged books with newer ones.  If it's a popular title then sure they'd probably get a new copy of the same book, but if it's not then they'd just take it out of circulation and put a different title in its place.

If your library doesn't have [title of some LGBTQ book you're looking for] it doesn't necessarily mean it's banned, it just means they didn't choose to buy it

What I struggle with is how do you determine what is a ""ban"" and what is just the staff at the library not ordering it for their library?  If they take all the copies (that are in good condition) off the shelf then yeah that's concerning, and obviously if they say the quiet part out loud and say ""we don't want books on [subject] here"" but I hear people talk about ""book bans"" a lot more than they're probably actually applicable.

When you're scared about a large group of people from literally just reading about a same sex relationship, ""race mixing"" or even historical books about vital pieces of our history like the slave trade - you're 100% just trying to stop people from expressing who they are.

In the US, [education is compulsory](https://www.findlaw.com/education/education-options/compulsory-education-laws-background.html) under the principle that an educated society is better than an ignorant one (also, compulsory education was instrumental in combating child labor abuse but that is another discussion). Librarians are a primary authority responsible for guiding access to materials. Every rating system is inherently subject to biases, flaws, and other agendas but may be used to inform one's decisions. ""Inform"" being an operative word here and school librarians subscribe to criteria for their collection which, in addition to abiding by principles which dictate public library curation, may include variations on support and enrichment of curriculum &/or students’ personal interests and learning; whether appropriate for the subject area & for the age, emotional development, ability level, learning styles, and social, emotional, & intellectual development of the students for whom the materials are selected; incorporate accurate & authentic factual content from authoritative sources; earn favorable reviews in standard reviewing sources &/or favorable recommendations based on preview and examination of materials by professional personnel.

In short, the material your second grader is exposed to as part of public (and often private) curriculum has been decided by a litany of authoritative persons and organizations.

"lq4usmv","XBreaksYFocusGroup","2024-10-03 13:36:39 UTC","This meets the criteria for a book ban by reputable organizations and leaders in library sciences. Per the American Library Association:

> A challenge is an attempt to remove or restrict materials, based upon the objections of a person or group. A banning is the removal of those materials. Challenges do not simply involve a person expressing a point of view; rather, they are an attempt to remove material from the curriculum or library, thereby restricting the access of others. 

Meanwhile, PEN America defines a school book ban as:

> [...] any action taken against a book based on its content and as a result of parent or community challenges, administrative decisions, or in response to direct or threatened action by lawmakers or other governmental officials, that leads to a previously accessible book being either completely removed from availability to students, or where access to a book is restricted or diminished. It is important to recognize that books available in schools, whether in a school or classroom library, or as part of a curriculum, were selected by librarians and educators as part of the educational offerings to students. Book bans occur when those choices are overridden by school boards, administrators, teachers, or even politicians, on the basis of a particular book’s content. 

With a broader public library ban following the same principles. Or if you prefer the authoritative Encyclopedia Britannica: 

> Book banning, the practice of prohibiting or restricting the reading of certain books by the general public or by members of a local community or religious group. Books can be banned by means of their removal from publicly accessible locations (e.g, libraries), by their destruction (including the burning of printed books), or by making their authorship or distribution a punishable act. 

All of which encompass restrictions and prohibitions of access to resources.

Libraries already adhere to selection criteria which may vary in space to space and depending on the population served but most include (but are not limited to) variants on: present and potential relevance to community needs; suitability of subject and style for intended audience; cost; relation to the existing collection; requests; user appeal; authority; comprehensiveness and depth of treatment; skill, competence, and purpose of the author; reputation and significance of the author; objectivity; clarity; representation of diverse points of view; whether media meets high standards in literary, artistic, and aesthetic quality; technical aspects; representation of important movements, genres, or trends; relevance and use of the information; effective characterization; and authenticity of history or social setting. Additionally, school libraries may consider elements such as: support and enrichment of curriculum &/or students’ personal interests and learning; whether appropriate for the subject area & for the age, emotional development, ability level, learning styles, and social, emotional, & intellectual development of the students for whom the materials are selected; incorporate accurate & authentic factual content from authoritative sources; earn favorable reviews in standard reviewing sources &/or favorable recommendations based on preview and examination of materials by professional personnel.","lq4swb9"

Some of these include, waning interest, irrelevancy, unreasonable cost to repair/replace, outdated information, etc. Books which are removed for these reasons are never considered ""banned"" by any reputable authority tracking these events, just as never shelving a book which hasn't already been approved for addition is not a ban. They are only considering removals and restrictions (and in some cases, pending challenges which include extended temporary removals) resulting from these formal third-party challenges to materials which have already been deemed appropriate, relevant, and deserving of inclusion in a library for having cleared a litany of checks and reasons justifying their place in limited space. This is important.

What is age appropriate is a [complicated question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_appropriateness) as it will vary by person to person and there are a cohort of intersectional factors which contribute to one's development - which is why, ultimately, US society promotes that the reader or individual audience decides. In the US, [education is compulsory](https://www.findlaw.com/education/education-options/compulsory-education-laws-background.html) under the principle that an educated society is better than an ignorant one (also, compulsory education was instrumental in combating child labor abuse but that is another discussion). Librarians are a primary authority responsible for guiding access to materials. Every rating system is inherently subject to biases, flaws, and other agendas but may be used to inform one's decisions.

There is a reason why Creationism is not taught in schools and evolution is. Students also have rights and arguably more legal protections than parents have in dictating their education including access to resources and a curriculum that has been concluded to benefit their growth. There are laws in place about the extent of harm you can do to your child and especially that of other children. If a litany of professionals agree that, for instance, learning from diverse voices and narratives stands to benefit children (spoiler: >!it does!<) and causes little to no harm, they have a duty to incorporate those learnings.

When organizations track bans and challenges, they are referring to formal attempts to remove or restrict access to materials. Formal here meaning petitioned in writing or an approved setting. With reason, provided by challengers, usually in writing though sometimes captured in transcript. 

Libraries and organizations collate these reasons and in doing so, patterns emerge. Some highly popular citations include accusations of material being - and I quote - ""woke, glorifying gay marriage, anti-police, not a happy ending, Marxist, critical race theory, gender non conformity"" etc (""witchcraft"" used to be very high on the list but has fallen off in the past several years). Of course, the perennial cited reasons with the highest frequency are ""LGBTQIA"" and ""sexually explicit.""

“Gender Queer” recounts the author’s life and confusion surrounding gender and sexuality. Several scenes reveal the main character’s desire to remove her breasts and get rid of her period. Most of the book focuses on the author’s desire to change gender. One scene illustrates a sexting exchange with another biological female: “I got a new strap-on harness today. I can’t wait to put it on you. It will fill my favorite dildo perfectly…I’m going to give you the blow job of your life then I want you inside of me.” Another scene describes the main character’s visit to the San Francisco armory, which was bought by a BDSM pornography producer for filming.”

I have read the book in which the author expresses trauma experience and methods of exploring or processing trauma and identity. Those often circulated scenes taken out of context are wildly un-sexy in context. They show someone engaging in performative actions or language and realizing it fails to address owned dysphoria. What it *does* show is consenting adults supporting each other and allowing exploration in a safe, non-judgmental environment. Which is a good message we should all be able to get behind. The book ends with the author still experiencing dysphoria but in high spirits to better manage the difficulty. It isn't a guide on how to sext. It is a memoir.

On a personal note, I would not recommend it to any young Assigned Female at Birth person as there are some legitimately disturbing scenes related to puberty and the femme body experience. I would, however, recommend it to highschoolers that feel interested in this narrative (which coincidentally is what publishers and other authoritative vested parties deem the appropriate demographic). I personally think it might be suitable for younger Assigned Male at Birth kids who express interest in it and it could be formative in their allyship to friends experiencing similar moments in their lives.

It’s that these books are graphic, illustrated pornography,” McGinley said. She wants to see New Hampshire Republicans focus on the content of these books, which are being accessed by children as young as 10 or 11. “Any time Republicans talk in general terms about ‘obscene’ books, they help Democrats promote the fantasy that people are going after Huckleberry Finn and Harry Potter. “Use the word ‘pornography,’” she said.

Right, that's not the issue; the issue is what is inappropriate for kids.   It's a moral question, not a legal one.

A good example of this is the actress Charlize Theron. She adopted two boys from Africa, and both of them decided they were transgender. One at age 3. Very doubtful that both would end up being trans. As if at age 3 you really have a concept and know the difference between what a male or female is. Obviously Charlize pushes these ideas onto her children at a young age. Not any different than religion or other types of indoctrination.","lq69zx0"

So if that's the definition this dipshit ""reporter"" is going with, then I really don't trust his conclusions on the other books, because it really seems like any discussion of queer identity is going to get clocked as ""sexually explicit"" by him.

I actually just took the time to flip back through it, and the most explicit it gets is mentioning or discussing masturbation a few times, with one mention of eventually, someday, wanting to have sex. And the occasional implication that penises exist. As a person who worked in schools for 15 years around kids who seem to think adults are deaf and stupid, I can ***assure*** you, these middle schoolers already know about these things and talk about them.

This is nothing you couldn't hear on an episode of *This American Life*. And this is all stuff that Judy Blume covered in her books decades ago for straight kids. And, of course, those, too, while now regarded by most as classics, were challenged at the time and still occasionally get challenged by the pearl-clutchers. But queer kids need this kind of literature, too.

There's nothing in this book that's not appropriate for a middle school kid who is going through puberty and starting to feel these sorts of feelings. I ***wish*** that books like this had existed when I was in middle school. They might have saved me decades of depression, confusion, suicidal ideation, self-loathing, and denial that nearly derailed my life.

Fundamentally, that's what this panic is about: the people banning these books *want* queer kids feel unnatural, unwanted, and unwelcome. They don't want our next generation to see themselves represented in media that talks about the feelings they are currently having. 

They want our kids to feel trapped and unable to be themselves. And if the deep despair of that situation means a few queer kids kill themselves along the way, that's no skin off these bigots' noses.

The interpretation of double negation as cancelling is a standard in some dialects. In others (eg AAVE), a double negative is the grammatically proper construct. There are similar differences if you were to compare how I speak versus someone from rural Tennessee or Alabama. [Southern American English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English) is a family of dialects with their own rules. Those are in the group [North American English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English) inside subgroup [American English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English). All of those, of course, are distinct from the countless dialects in the UK and Ireland, which are in turn from the dialects spoken in India and other post-colonial states. 

It (language and grammar) changes over time, too. Read fiction from 100 years ago. Choose something written by an educated American author. It will be different from novels of today. Go back 200 years - it’s even more different. 

Okay, I know everyone knows this upon reflection. What I’m doing is reminding people of this in order to to point out that there’s no “proper” English. Not only are the dialects effectively random, the relative dominance of any group of dialects is as well. Code switching is necessary to communicate contextually with other groups, and that’s the way grammar and language should be taught, in my opinion.","lq8lshb"
