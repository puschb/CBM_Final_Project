In children's sections and school libraries, correct. The Anne Frank diary was the expanded version and the graphic novel. Both included sexual matter some parents believe should be addressed at home and/or at their discretion. 

Same with the Penguin book as let's be honest, you know it wasn't just a picture book about penguins with zero cultural agendas. 

Agree with the restrictions or not, the vast majority simply come down to children's access. Many parents believe schools and public education related facilities should be focused on primary education. Social agendas and cultural upbringing is the parents choice when raising their children.

How is that a point? That's just a raw fact.

You are missing the point of why state bans are undesirable in the first place. It's not because it's the state doing something. The state does things all the time. It's because the consequence of a ban by the state is that it's very difficult to get the thing. It's therefore also bad if this consequence, a thing becoming very hard to get, is brought about by capitalists. If the thing shouldn't be banned by the state, it also shouldn't be banned by private power.

> something that supposedly the free market accounts for

So your argument is that somehow the _free market_ is more reliable when it comes to reflecting the will of the people than the government? Which is.. let me check my notes here.. constituted of _elected representatives_? The state is constantly stepping in and overruling the free market. The civil rights act, for example, is a glaring admission that the free market _failed_ to treat people the same regardless of their skin color.

You argue this way only because you do not care about this outcome or you think the outcome is good. Otherwise _of course_ you would complain about it! When Twitter wasn't cracking down hard enough on racism or sexism or misinformation. What was the refrain? ""Oh well gee that sucks but Twitter is a private company so this isn't actually even bad. Shut UP everyone!"" No, it was ""change what you're fucking doing, Twitter! Moderate!""

>Allowing the *option* to check out a book is not pushing anything on anyone. Not allowing others that option based on *your* beliefs are. 

A public school is responsible for what it provides children access to. It should be held to a standard. What you do at home is at your personal discretion as a parent. 

>I believe the bible is an incredibly harmful book and shouldn't be read by children. Should I get to have it banned from schools?

Honestly I don't think any directly religious material belongs in a public grade school library. Whether that be the Bible, Koran, or The Vedas. I would agree with those not being allowed either. 

Religion (or absence of) is another choice that is up to the parents when their child is young. It's not a public schools responsibility or place.

>That is being left to the parents. Not allowing others to access information because of your ass backwards religion is a form of bigotry.

Others have access, just not at school. Believing grade schools should only be for teaching the basics and parents responsible for raising their children how they see fit is not bigotry.

Yeah, I agree. I never claimed they are the same, I don't know why you insist on repeating this. You entirely miss the point. The fact that it's not the law forcing it doesn't make it not a bad thing or not something objectionable. You see, capitalists can still do bad things that we as a society don't want, even if they aren't illegal. You do understand that? This happens all the time. And if it's frequent or bad enough, we might even pass a law to _make_ it illegal. If your argument is ""well I don't care about this thing happening"" then just be honest and say that.

Then they can keep their students out of the sex ed portion of the curriculum. That has fuck all to do with what books are in the library, and what books are being banned. 

>Pushing/arguing for access to sexuality related material to grade school children is a weird stance to take

Pushing/arguing for the same kind of bans Nazis had is a weird stance, but here you are. 

Also, for the record; it's not just grade schools. This is happening in middle hand high schools as well, and it's aimed at *anyone* under 18. 

You should also look at history sometime. Kids are perfectly fine learning this stuff. In the old days this stuff wasn't shielded from kids. Hell, it still ain't. Ask any farm kid about the birds and the bees; they'll be able to tell you *all* about it. 

By the way; what does 1984, Animal Farm, or Catcher in the Rye have to do with sexuality? All of them are on the list. 

>It should be, yes. Primarily at a young age.

Since you agree that it's a parental decision, that means the bans aren't necessary. 

>Funny enough even the extremely religious people in this argument aren't the ones ""pushing"" anything

Except they are. Do you think it's liberals that make up Moms for Liberty? 

>Their issue is with other people pushing stuff on their children.

Are you a dullard or something? I've already explained this to you. Having the books available is not pushing anything on kids.

And public schools have been held to a standard for decades. It's funny how these books were all fine and dandy until the GOP needed a new boogeyman to target, and suddenly people like you have issues. 

>Believing grade schools should only be for teaching the basics and parents responsible for raising their children how they see fit is not bigotry.

Forcing your beliefs such as this on others *is* bigotry.

Parents already had such a right *before* these asinine laws were passed, and when you extend those parents beliefs to others, it is.

You might not believe it's factual. others would argue differently. That's were faith comes in.

As for world view, religion can actually help people with a more positive world view in a lot of cases. It's not like atheism always results in a happy life and great choices. As with either, results may vary given the human factor.

>It's indoctrination.

Many call pushing LGBQ and sexuality on children is indoctrination. Any world view can be considered indoctrination depending on whonis asked.

I agree that's hypocritical. Personally I am fine with some of the books not being allowed in public schools for younger children. They have no place. Given the current academic status of the US our schools should be focusing less on social issues and more on core academics. 

As for bans in high schools and public libraries I agree most of the books should be allowed.","lq2al9o"

Sounds like you don't respect the beliefs of others. I'm sorry to hear that. I assumed you would be more tolerant.

>Teaching kids that gay people exist is not indoctrination. The fact that you equate the two is troubling. 

It's far more than simply stating they exist. I was also just pointing out different people have different views. Of course many narrow minded and egotistical people assume there's is the only correct world view and everyone who doesn't agree is wrong. I take it your one of those?

For the record I don't care if a person is straight or gay. A person's sexuality isn't what defines them, nor is it a deciding factor in whether they are a good person or not.

>Most books for High schoolers? which would you ban?

At this point why even go into it? It's apparent we won't find common ground. We can just agree to disagree. Take care and have a good night.","lq2o4z8"

[The Florida Department of Education](https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/5574/urlt/2223ObjectionList.pdf) uses the term discontinued. Am I missing something?

I'm tolerant of an individuals views; you can believe and worship however you want in the privacy of your own home or church. It's when that bullshit starts to effect the rest of us that we have a problem. Fundamentalism, no matter which flavor of it, is an issue for society. If you don't see that, I don't know what to tell you. 
You might not care about a person's orientation, or their right to healthcare, etc, but plenty of your coreligionists do, and those nutbars judge the rest of us and vote in terrible, self enriching scam artists of politicians. Carving out an exception for 'the good ones' is fine, but those people (and yourself, I'm assuming) still vote the way the crazies do, and that effects us all as a society.
