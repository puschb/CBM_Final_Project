"luzcwbg","gate18","2024-11-02 06:26:59 UTC","When it comes to fiction, I love reading fast! Like you, I don't remember details a few days after reading the book, but I love the experience! I have tried to read slowly, and I would remember the story for longer and sit within that world for longer. However, regardless of the speed, eventually, you do forget! 

Fiction has changed my entire inner world. I have yet to find anything more transformative. It has shaken my core. It has made me connect to humanity. I imagine travelling does that, but every fifth book or so, I feel the author, not only the characters, sharing something intimate—screaming, ""This is another way.""

Reading (fast) is like throwing mud (if not paint) on the wall. Most of it falls off, but something sticks - a stain that something left a mark here. My mission with reading is to leave as many marks in my brain as possible.

My approach is terrible if you want to impress people! If it weren't for Goodreads, I wouldn't know most books I have read. However, most of them have left a mark. Most of them were conversations - we don't remember most of the conversations either. Only those meaningful to us stick

As I typed this, the first two comments I kept glancing at claimed that slow reading makes for a more enjoyable experience and that reading is not a competition.

Everyone knows it's not a competition (otherwise, they would have won something). Hence, they read fast because they find joy in doing so, surely.",""

I have a coworker who told me that she's reading a book that she loves so much that she rations how much of it she reads in a week and I don't understand it. The way I see it, there's a seemingly infinite number of beautiful books to read in my finite life, there's no need to ration. That said, I do get what you're saying. It's what I love about reading thick, chonky 800+ page books that just meander and unapologetically take their time. 


I used to get frustrated that I couldn't remember every book I read but I've long since gotten over that. There are some trash books I finished in two days where every stupid plot points are forever etched into my brain and there are some beautifully written, gut wrenching books that don't recall much about except that it made me cry.

"luzq0rh","Deleted","2024-11-02 09:04:52 UTC","For me, it depends on the kind of book I'm reading. If I'm reading crime fiction or other easy reads, I will sort of just rush through it and not give much thought afterwards.


But when I'm reading heavier works like Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, I read at a much slower pace. Partly, because the writing style of 1800's literature takes more time to understand, and also because my mind needs time to digest the deeper meaning in the stories. ",""
"luz6xow","every_life_a_story","2024-11-02 05:22:35 UTC","It depends on the book and on you I feel. For instance if you are someone who has a big stack of unread books, you might feel a bit of that pressure to read faster to get to the other books. This problem becomes more pronounced when you are also in the habit of buying books indiscriminately. You don't need to join a competition or even put your reading self against other readers. The sheer sight of those unread piles will spurn you into action.

Another angle is the books you choose to read. You may not sit and savor a quick burn thriller like you would for a classic. Anna Karenina deserves to be consumed slowly to fully grasp the beauty of it all but the same will not hold true for a whodunit or a thriller.

However, I'm currently re-reading ""Jane Eyre"" (for the 5th time) and I've been absolutely loving taking my time with it.

"lv0rub9","FloraSin","2024-11-02 14:26:23 UTC","It really just depends on what I'm reading, honestly. Storygraph says I've read 142 books this year so far. I think that number is so high (seems high to me. My goal is always just a book a month) because I'm reading a wide variety of things. I also think that using an app to track my to-read list has helped me spend less time fussing over what I should read next. 

I just finished Priory of the Orange Tree, which was over 800 pages, but I also read a bunch of short stories this year. I work with children and one of them started reading The Chronicles of Narnia books. So, I've been rereading those as she gets to them because she loves to talk about what she's reading. They're fairly short. 

Horror, Thriller, Fantasy, and Science Fiction are my top genres. Horror and Thriller novels blow by me because often the tension hits a point that I get locked in and can't put them down. My fantasy picks tend to run a little longer because I lean towards stuff that gets tagged for world building, so those take more time. Sci-fi usually has concepts/ideas that I like to think about or discuss between reads.

I think another factor is modernity and familiarity with the culture. Last year, I read Assyria: The Rose and Fall of the World's First Empire by Eckhart Frahm. It took me about two weeks (and I was bedridden at the time, so reading often). Despite how accessible it is, I still found myself googling things and falling down rabbit holes. 

Personally, whether I remember something will just be a matter of how it hits me when I read it. I'm already forgetting things about PotOT because it just didn't capture me, but I could still discuss The Double Life of Benson Yu, which was my first finished read of the year. I haven't read Anna Karenina since high school (I'm about to be 36), but still remember that fairly well too (and recall that it took me around a month to finish).

"lv1mdqq","structured_anarchist","2024-11-02 17:13:50 UTC","I don't know if it makes sense to anyone else, but I read at the 'pace' of the book.  Some books move quickly in their story and it keeps me reading, going as fast as I can to to find out what comes next.  Other books don't have the same effect on me.  For example, I ripped through ASOIAF because I wanted to find out what happened next.  But when I read the Discworld series, I didn't go as fast, simply because there's so much in each chapter that you want to absorb it all.

I don't worry about 'competing' for most read books anything like that.  I don't care if I haven't kept up with some arbitrary 'proper' number of books read in a specific timeframe.  If a book makes me go through it fast, that's the author doing a good job of making me want to read more of it.  If a book makes me read slower, it's because I don't want to miss any detail.

This means that, in addition to picking up the book, you will also switch off your phone and stop checking your email for at least a short period of time. This helps the brain focus on one thing, rather than being bombarded with information from all sides. And, accordingly, it calms you down. The main benefit of slow reading is that it has a positive effect on your ability to absorb new information and make logical connections with facts you already know. By allowing your brain to take in a text more slowly, regardless of its length (book or article), you allow new information to build stronger connections with what you already have in your head: facts, ideas, memories.",""

"luze2ba","scorcheded","2024-11-02 06:40:29 UTC","it feels a lot like people trying to cope with not being able to read quickly. there's nothing wrong with it. reading slow is fine. reading  fast is fine. no one gets to tell anyone else that how they read is invalid. i'm a fast reader. i read hundreds of books a year. i'm not doing it to impress anyone. i often delete my good reads and start fresh. there's nothing inherently ""better"" about ""taking your time"" with a book that is read for pleasure. if you need to read for a class and absolutely need to retain ever little thing, then yeah. i'm sure people don't remember every little thing about tv shows/movies/video games, etc, that they've consumed either . some books you should take your time with (you shouldn't ""read"" ulysses listening to an audiobook at 2.5x for instance) but overall. read how you'd like. everyone else is!","luzcwbg"

I am reading a fantasy book by an author I like slowly. That’s more because I don’t want to give up on it yet but I’ve read like 5 other books since I started it. (Also I bought it and the others are due back at the library.)","luzacxk"

"lv11mmz","NoahAwake","2024-11-02 15:21:37 UTC","That’s so interesting to me! I can’t fathom that, but I read slower in a different way. I usually end up taking notes and doing a lot of deep fives on the author and the period it was written in. It helps me feel more immersed.","luzuo44"
"luzw1de","Vibe-party","2024-11-02 10:14:47 UTC","100% agree. It's often around the end of the year that people are more likely to talk about when they didn't reach their reading goals. And I agree that books are one of the only media where people talk about retaining every single detail (and there are exceptions as you said).

I feel like when people want to make goals and then try to speedrun through it, they burn out and then act like people who are reading fast are reading the wrong way (because they are projecting) - even though people who read fast naturally just enjoy reading in a different way (I'm not saying OP is saying this, some comments here certainly give that impression).

There are so many people who read casual books, enjoy the process and move on. Maybe they have a little notebook, annotate the book or talk about it with their friends and then move on. Some people's only hobby are reading books and go through them fast just because they spend more time on them. Other people go faster if they use an ereader or audiobooks. Some people don't read a 500+ page fantasy novel each time, so their numbers go up. So it also depends on what type of genre people enjoy.

I retain most books I read just like tv-shows and games. Not every detail, just the overall story and highlights. Who cares what the weather is like in 99% of books. I'm spending hours on one book, so it's easier to remember than reading ""AITA? My mom kicked my dog and I said some bad words"" on Reddit. And even on Reddit you'd remember it when it's so wild that you want to remember it.

I keep a journal to retain the parts I want to retain and when a book hits me and I adore it, I will remember most details. When I don't retain a book, chances are that I didn't enjoy it, but isn't bad enough to DNF it. I'll remember it when I reread my notes/summary. I'm not at school anymore, I don't need to read to take tests. I take my time with books when they need more attention but for others I enjoy just going through my own pace by reading faster otherwise my brain just loses interest at some point. Everyone's different.

I'm glad for OP that they have found their own pace. I don't like reading goals either, so I put my goal to 1 book and then read how much I want. Other people love it and it keeps them motivated and I'm glad for them as well.","luze2ba"
"lv0eqbu","Anxious-Fun8829","2024-11-02 13:03:00 UTC","I agree. I think that school (at least in the US) might have traumatized a lot of slower readers because slow reading was often equated with intelligence for some dumb reason. 


I can read two or three full sized novels in a week. That doesn't mean I'm smarter or that I value reading more than someone who can't. It just means I've trained myself to read faster, it's something I've consciously dedicated time to do, and I'm fortunate to have that time.


But, it also doesn't mean that I'm being performative or that my reading or understanding is shallow.","luze2ba"
"lv11wai","NoahAwake","2024-11-02 15:23:08 UTC","This is such a great point! The only goal with reading should be to enjoy it. Everyone engages material differently and there’s no valor in reading fast or slow.","luze2ba"
