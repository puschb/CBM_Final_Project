"lu8dao2","AAWonderfluff","2024-10-28 20:04:08 UTC","I guess the best answer I could give is curiosity. Sometimes, I like to learn in a self-help, self-development way (I recently read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius for example) - I dropped out of college (I really wasn't mature or disciplined enough for it when I was college age) and nowadays I sort of regret that, so in a way I'm trying to educate myself a bit on what I could have learned there. 

Other times, I want to learn about what inspired one of my favorite works of other media. For example, one of my favorite records is Pink Floyd's Animals, which was inspired by Animal Farm - so I read that, and that's actually the book that got me started reading regularly for fun last year (yep, I'm late to the party). Another band I like (King Crimson) has a song called The Sheltering Sky, so now I'm reading Paul Bowles' novel The Sheltering Sky.

And sometimes you find something neat at a thrift store or a used bookstore and give it a shot. I read a pulpy sci-fi book called Phase IV and I never would have found it if I didn't go thrifting. So...yeah, curiosity.",""

I stopped reading for pleasure altogether during my studies, but slowly started to enjoy reading again after graduating in 2016. I'm still not quite to the point I was at before university, but that honestly has more to do with the time constraints imposed by responsibilities/adulthood.

"lu8eiwt","confessorjsd","2024-10-28 20:10:17 UTC","I loved reading (still do) a ton when I was young. I would read all sorts of books. Thought about becoming a book editor, but the college I wanted to attend was out of state and my mom said I couldn't take on that debt to be an English major. I could do it in state, but not at my desired university out of state. So I studied something else.

I'm kind of grateful for that because I feel like I would have ended up where you are. I did study something I was interested in, but now there's a lot about the world that's related to my job that I look at differently now. 

I did study a very intense course, and so I maybe read 3-5 books outside of school a year. Then I got married and read maybe 20 books a year after school was out. Then I had kids. Not sure if I read 5 books a year. That was about 10 years.

Now that I'm done having kids I wanted to get back into reading. I started slow and just set a Goodreads goal of 40 books. The next year I did 52. This is year 3 and my goal was 70. I just hit my goal yesterday!

I also spiced it up by doing a book challenge from the library. That got me reading more books outside my normal genre. This year I gave myself an additional goal to read 52 books that I currently own. I'm about 3 books behind and only have done 40 so far. But it's getting me to read books that I know I like but just haven't been feeling. It's getting me back to my roots. 

But I've also found my way into a smutty rabbit hole (I hope my librarians never look at my Libby history) which is very different from my sci Fi/fantasy roots I had as a child! I also do many more audiobooks and Kindle books than I used to which I find gets me reading more.

I think tastes change and that's ok. But definitely giving myself challenges has brought the joy of reading back for me. For you, I'd definitely pick books that aren't meant to be great literature. Just great stories. Things that are popular. And do your damnedest not to analyze lol.

I read for myself, as a hobby, to save money (shout out to the library) and save my health (among the healthier hobbies I engage in) and because it‚Äôs part of who I am. I read because it‚Äôs fun and I need something fun just for me that‚Äôs not social. Keeping my relationship with reading healthy means reading what I want, even if it‚Äôs outside the canon, even if it‚Äôs total trash.

"lu8umxd","cirignanon","2024-10-28 21:31:33 UTC","Do what I did, make it a habit. It sucks at first and it feels annoying but if you start with books you love it makes the process less painful. It is hard to pick apart your favorites because they are your favorites for a reason. Like I love Jurassic Park and it's sequel The Lost World. On the level I know they are not perfect books and certain stuff does not hold up over time or with some simple scrutiny but I love them. So I was able to read it and enjoy it, even with noticing the flaws, and not feel bad about it. Same was true for The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. I wanted to read books I loved and had a special place in my heart.

That combined with making it a habit opened me up to want to read new things. Have they all been good books? For sure not. Some have been classics or highly recommended and I found them annoying and boring (East of Eden and Mistborn, for the curious). Then I found a ridiculous book at the library and devoured it in a day (Enter the Aardvark). That was another thing that has helped me build this habit, borrowing from the library. There is usually a deadline for the return so it feels like a limited time offer. So I have to quickly read it and get it back to them so I can find another gem to read. Sort of puts a time table on the reading for me, at first, and pushed me to read more. Now I find myself just wanting to read instead of other things.

So my advice is make a plan to read for 15-20 minutes before bed or during lunch and start with books you love that even if you feel yourself getting analytical you can sort of ignore it because you know what happens. Then slowly move away from known books to short easy to digest books. Ones with quick chapters or small page counts. Try short story collections and plan to read 1 story a day or a week.

Oh yeah and lastly, get rid of at least half of your social media accounts. I no longer use Twitter (I will call it X when the sun swallows the earth) or Facebook and I have time limits on my phone for Instagram. That keeps me focused and also allows me to feel like ""what should I do, oh yeah I can't do that, so I guess I will read.""

"luayd1i","SchemeSimilar4074","2024-10-29 05:04:55 UTC","I can relate to your experience. I fell out of love with reading in the past 15 years. Only since last year, I fell in love with reading again. It feels like reconnecting with your childhood best friend. There are times when I really grieved the lonely 15 years I didn't love reading. I'm so grateful to be able to truly love reading again. Now I protect my relationship with reading ferociously. I don't want to lose this connection again. 

I grew up in Vietnam and I really loved reading as a child . Other girls may dream of having a doll house but I dreamt of having a library. We don't have library at school. Vietnam was a very poor country. I read everything I got my hands at, even the sport newspaper even though I don't like sport. I guess we didn't have social media so I got nothing to do except to read. Then I moved to Australia and suddenly reading became a chore, reading = studying. Reading in English is so difficult that it was impossible for me to truly enjoy it. I couldnt read books that I was interested in because there were too many words I didn't understand. Although my English got better, between readings textbooks and journal articles for school and uni, my brain was trained to ""study"" whenever it saw text, instead of just reading for the sake of reading. It doesn't help that I have ADHD which means it's even more difficult for me to concentrate to read text in another language and I got frustrated because I couldn't concentrate. 

Then I went to live in Japan and I went from Hard Mode to Challenge Mode. Although I was fluent in Japanese, reading in Japanese was even more difficult than reading in English. So much that reading gave me headache. I returned to Australia, still traumatised by the difficulty of reading caused me. The shame of not being able to concentrate enough to finish a book. Last year, I became addicted to a web novel online. It was a smutty romance fantasy novel written by a Korean author, translated to English. I was surprised at how easy it was to read, I didn't even notice I was reading. Since then, I started reading more romance fantasy novels. They're very trashy, to be fair. I had a more refined taste when I was a child, I read classics and award-winning novels. But I fell in love with reading again after reading trashy mass-market and self-published books ü§£. I think the experience retrains my brain to think reading can be the same as watching TV. In fact, I don't have a Netflix subscription but I do have a Kindle Unlimited description and I spend way more money on book than I do on skincare and clothes combined. I don't care if the books I like are trashy. I don't even talk about them, because I'm a bit embarrassed about the stuffs I read üòÖ

Since then, I grew out of romance fantasy novels since they're too tropey and have picked up poetry, philosophy, scifi, non-fiction, etc. Basically anything that I found interesting. I still struggle with the ""study mode"" when I read non-fiction. I itched to take notes and memorised things but it'd surely kill my budding relationship with reading. That's why I said I protect this feeling ferociously. 

 I don't pressure myself to finish the whole book or read cover to cover. It's not a textbook. I read pages and chapters that I like. I pick the book that I feel like reading at a given point in time. I don't pressure myself to get anything out of this ""relationship"" (book). If I don't feel like reading, I 'read' poetry. I have my favourite poems that I re-read often even if I don't understand it. My favourite poet is Emily Dickinson and Im sure I misunderstand half of my favourite poems of hers. You don't have to truly understand each other to become best friend. It's OK to take 6 months or even a year to finish reading a book.

I also bought pastel highlighter and the transparent post-it stickers. Whenever I saw something that bothers me, I highlight it, add a postit sticker and move on. It helps fight the itch to take note and just enjoy. Sometimes I flick through pages where there is a sticker when I'm bored and it helps to refresh my memory. It's also a reflective exercise with poetry and philosophy books. There are paragraphs that captures my attention although I don't understand why. So sometimes flicking through the pages over time gives me different perspectives about myself. 

My goal at the moment is to be able to read books from the library for fun (to save money and there are a wider selection). I can't write on them the way I did with my own books. I also have to return it so I can't stay on the same book for 6 months with my own üòÑ. Maybe I'll get there, maybe I won't. But I found the love of reading after so many years and I won't let it be taken away from me no matter what.

I hope my experience helps you to find new ideas to change your relationship with reading. Treat reading like a person, perhaps? For me, it was like reconnecting with an old childhood friend. We've completely forgotten about each other and have grown up and changed. So to be friend again, it took time  (it took me 2 years since I first read that trashy web novel). There are also lots of trials and errors with how to ""interact"" with each other (i.e how to read), how to choose the suitable kind of activities to spend time with each other (i.e what book to read). (Maybe I'm taking this person analogy a bit too far ü§£). How would you characterise your relationship with reading? What do you want this relationship to be? You can't regain a childhood friend exactly as when you were a child. You can only reconnect with the friend again, as the new adult you. 

Good luck! I'm sure you'll be fine. Be patient and dont judge your ""friend"".  Even I can do it, with language barriers and ADHD and all that.",""

I get annoyed about the high mindedness of reading. Not everything needs a deep literary evaluation. I can respect that you have little control over your training to analyze and take apart a text. But reading for the overwhelming majority of people throughout history was a means to tell a story or share information. Ultimately, for the majority of authors in history, they desire to have their work read and that's it. I think that these authors themselves never considered their works in the same lense that literary people do. It wasn't the purpose. The proof is in the sales. Popular fiction is popular because it speaks to the majority of people. And where some popular fiction is actual garbage, alot of it is good stories. And that's the whole point. Tell a good story.

I prescribe to you, Stephen King, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, Andy Weir. These are authors that I always enjoy reading. Alot of their books are dumb as fuck. If you sit down to read them, keep in your mind that they wrote this for you, and the best way you can respect their efforts would be to listen to their story.

I became an overachiever (like I usually do with subjects I enjoy, if I master them it gives me a huge confidence boost.) 

I love forming the scenarios in my mind, reading them and imagining the backgrounds, the characters by descriptions, etc. If I imagine a beautiful scene, I‚Äôm hooked. 

A while ago I stopped reading, it didn‚Äôt feel enjoyable for some reason, I just couldn‚Äôt imagine a good background and I found myself just uninterested, until this school year. I‚Äôm in high school and my new reading teacher suspected no one would do the summer reading assignment so she opted for reading it as a class. That book was freaking amazing. I loved it so much that I‚Äôm now getting it for Christmas so I can re-read again. I say it was the tone she read it in (she‚Äôs also a theatre teacher) and how I managed to make up a good scenery in my mind that got me hooked.

*Saga* is still ongoing, but all the others are finished series.","lu8izug"
"lu8z58r","MisterMan007","2024-10-28 21:55:02 UTC","I was also going to suggest this idea. I would recommend some of the classics: Preacher, The Sandman, Bone, Scott Pilgrim.

Also, anything by Alan Moore. He wrote Watchmen, V for Vendetta, From Hell, and more. Lots of them were made into movies that did not live up to the comics at all. Extra credit if you analyze Watchmen. That one gets deep.","lu8izug"
"lucfbx0","earlyriser79","2024-10-29 13:22:54 UTC","Ryan North's Adventure Time comics are so entertaining and funny and nerdy. Same with his Fantastic Four series. Also Squirrel Girl is awesome, AWESOME, even for people who don't like super heroes. All his comics are very wordy, I like to read in my comics, not just to see, and he makes every frame/word count and it could have philosophical jokes when you less expect it.  
  
Also he has a book ""How to invent everything"" that's basically the history of civilization in comedy.","lu8izug"
"luc597c","netflixandquills","2024-10-29 12:17:19 UTC","Commercial fiction depends on your interests. A lot of books that are heavily one genre would be skewing commercial or reading group. 

Romance is interesting depending on your comfort levels. Ashley Poston might be a good entry point. I particularly enjoyed The Dead Romantics. Helen Hoang, Beth O‚ÄôLeary, Jasmine Guillory, and Emily Henry are authors I would recommend. 

SFF is often more on the reading group side but I would recommend Ben Aaronovitch, Jasper Fforde, TJ Klune, Ursula Le Guin and NK Jemisin. I think some of the more classic ones like Douglas Adams and Terry a Pratchett also make for easier reading than you would think. If you want something more character heavy Robin Hobb is excellent. 

I‚Äôm not much of a thriller or horror reader so I will leave those recommendations to others. Horror tends to skew a bit literary, or maybe that is just the ones I enjoy. I don‚Äôt mind an action thriller and I‚Äôve been making my way through the Slow Horses series by Mick Herron which has been fun. I also think The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo orignal trilogy by Stieg Larsson is worth it too. 

I love a good mystery. Benjamin Stevenson, Jane Harper, and Richard Osman  are some of my favourites. 

Other more general authors to check out include Fredrik Backman, Trent Dalton, Robin Sloan, and the list really goes on. 

I would just read synopses and see what piques your interest.","lubcdtg"

"lv0ih2b","DrLHS","2024-11-02 13:28:19 UTC","I cannot turn off the analysis; it's permanently in the ""on"" position and there's no power on earth that can change that. It's even working when I watch TV or read ""for fun."" Fortunately, however, my mind can work in both modes at once: i.e., I can be immersed in the story, empathizing with the characters and writing critical notes at the same time, positive or negative. This is why I've learned to love reading my Kindle books on my laptop. It makes taking notes easy and, occasionally, those notes will become part of the second novel I'm working on. I've been retired for almost 9 years now, but still reading for both pleasure and to hone my analytical and writing skills. I did try reading some ""low-brow slop"" at one point, pretty much out of necessity. While working on my doctorate, I worked 7 days a week, including a security guard position on the week-ends. Once, to take a break from reading and note-taking for my prelim, I looked for something easy to read and happened upon a magazine with a chapter from a Danielle Steele novel. I started out thinking, ""How bad can it be""?  Oy ve! That bad! It's like eating something incredibly bitter and not being able to get that taste out of your mouth. In any event, for the most part, I'm happy to have followed my instincts and settled on a course that still works for me. In short, I don't think my love of reading will ever fade.","lu8iyec"

However, the opposite has happened to me; i.e., the skills I learned in analyzing the so-called ""high-brow"" stuff are also applicable to more popular modes, such as Stephen King novels, one of which I included in my curriculum as both a horror story and a tragedy. It's well qualified as both. For me, there's great writing, good writing and schlock and those categories don't really correspond to the high and low-brow division.","lu8iemh"
