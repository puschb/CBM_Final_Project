I work as a voice director for cartoons, and probably half the people I meet who find that out tell me they always thought they should get into voice acting.  Just because you can do a shitty British accent doesn't make you a voice actor, and just because you can make up a story that delights your kid, it doesn't make you a children's author.  The difference is that you need to audition and book a part to become a voice actor, but any celebrity can throw together a children's book and publishers will jump at the chance to get it on the shelves since the book industry is all about marketing.

"ltc3d21","genericthrowaway021","2024-10-23 13:06:02 UTC","I'm working on completing a children's book as a personal goal for myself right now actually. Using a dog and cat as allegories for how people experience instability in living situations or unkind environments to encourage empathy and grace toward one another, while also holding firm boundaries when someone is acting out in lieu of that situation. I'm using books like McDuff for inspiration while teaching myself water color illustration. I do graphic design but I want it to be more customized- I'm even planting flowers in my garden in the spring to mix with binders for the paint and give the extra as a set to my niece and nephew. 
Another project that's been in the works is coloring activity book akin to what national geographic used to have. Environmental designs with various species identifications, learning about biomes, etc. that also includes a spot for ""parents and kid discuss what appropriate outfits/backpack items are in these climates and why"". Wondering how much climate will impact the accuracy when they're older, though.

I don't care if it ever goes anywhere since it's just a personal goal. Kids books are a labor of love and it's for them to learn, not for me to make money off of. That said, I completely empathize with people who are being overshadowed by others with accumulated wealth just dipping their toe in another hobby to profit off of. We should be giving children resources that they can have fun with in age appropriate ways, while also recognizing a lot of them are smarter than we give them credit for.

Most of these books are going to be weeded within a year. Meanwhile, Dr. Zeus is still going to be going strong a decade from now.

The real issue here is how children’s book illustration is getting farmed out to AI so all the kids books being published are done in the same boring generative style.

another thought is that celebrities like to publish children’s novels because it’s the one genre that’s written in a low enough reading level that most of them can do it without a ghost writer. You need at least grade 7 reading level to write escapist fiction.",""

Yes. A celebrity has name recognition and is likely given a speed pass into other industries, but it still has to be quality work that people buy for more than the celebrity name.

The publishing industry has been in decline for decades now, and there are plenty of independent authors that have grown a career from self publishing and e-books.

These arguments are like some 3rd string quarterback from Podunk High School whining that Payton and Eli Manning only had careers because of who their dad was.

Yes, there is nepotism in most industries and it can be hard when it’s not what you know, but who you know, and you feel your talent is being overlooked, but then again, maybe you’re just not as talented as you thought.

Doesn't matter if the language is dead simple, children are missing a lot of foundational building blocks of knowledge that  adults who don't have experience don't realize need to be taught, they think everyone knows it. I really have to search for books that are written with a small child's developmental ability in mind. 

Take most modern childrens book about anxiety and compare it to owl babies. There's a huge huge difference. I've found most modern books just say ""this is anxiety"" while going way too much into the phycology of those feelings. Something that a lot of children wouldn't understand. 

Where as owl babies, they're anxious about their mom being gone. They worry about where she is, reassure each other then with simple logic on where she could be and then are happy when she returns. Done, huge hit. Very reassuring for children.","ltbvcnl"

 You have to match the energy of kids, and that is something I could never wrap my head around now as a jaded adult. I suspect that anyone who does have that spark of joy wouldn't be the same person who would look at someone else's artful craft and say ""I could do that"".","ltbvcnl"

If you’ve got a character in mind and an existing actor can already fill that role without much effort then they’re probably the best person for the role.

With voice acting I feel like it’s different because a lot of the time the celebrity just isn’t the best person or close to.

But live action can also be guilty of similar, I remember Ed Sheeran being shoehorned into a Game of Thrones episode and it was awful how out of place he seemed.","lte67im"

Someone that can pull off drama properly as a actor/actress can do well with comedy scenes. Jason Statham always has to play the strait laced tough guy rules in movies, but in Spy he took that edge and went over the deep end becoming more and more outlandish in his portrayal.

Perhaps I don't understand what you're saying though.

You could say that it's taking away theater space from smaller budget films, and I'd say that's been an issue for years and is more of an issue of the lack of independent theaters than what films are being made. I used to be able to see films like The Fall or Babies in theaters, but that theater got bought by AMC and it's been a stagnant craphole ever since, playing primarily bigger budget films.

You’ve got to be able to see the big picture to understand how they’re connected.

And yes, it’s been ongoing for a while. 

Edited to add: I have friends who write for tv and film. One of the insidious things happening now is that a LOT of work is being bought and shelved (and the writers have no recourse to take it elsewhere). It’s a dominance strategy - buy and hoard good creative, keep your competitors from getting it but don’t produce it.

"ltbz1y9","Blissfulystoopid","2024-10-23 12:38:25 UTC","There are a few intersecting dynamics that complicate this. 

I don't think the cash earned by Marvel movies really *is* funding other projects. Modern blockbuster budgets have gotten so bloated that they *have* to turn insane profits to even justify their own existence, and as such, they warped the very nature of the market. They are *so* profitable, studios have decided that they don't want to invest in anything that isn't a guaranteed profit - name and brand recognition is king, and so the industry is dominated by franchises and remakes - standalone films are way less common. Even a bad marvel movie is a safe enough bet on how many seats it would fill, why take a risk on an untested concept? (And risk aversion ultimately causes inadvertent censorship as studios refuse to explore ideas that aren't sure bets).

Likewise, though I know less about the children's book market, other posters brought up that celebrity baby books are bought entirely by fans and parents. So it is getting fans who don't read to collect books as merch, but parents were *always* going to buy books regardless, so it isn't actually driving more people to reading. The argument (at least that the article proffers) is that a significant enough number of parents might buy celebrity books *instead* of professionally written books - which means that the baby books kids *are* getting are lower quality writing, less challenging, and less educational content.

At minimum, celebrities have a much stronger marketing engine which means their books (for all ages) get premium shelf placement and advertising while other, newer writers can't break in and compete as well, even if their writing is strong.","ltbxe0w"

There's no ""if""s about it - it would be naive to think anything other than *at the very least* their established industry connections helped them get it done. It is never happening 100% on merit. Actors aren't sending out manuscripts to be judged against all the other authors and getting picked because publishers think their book is best. They're getting picked because of the connections they're afforded through wealth and fame, and because the publisher thinks their name on a book will sell more.

There's a lot of people you could say this about that aren't getting that recognition because they don't have the wealth and fame to get it.

There are also occasions where a voice actor has defined a role for generations (plural) only to get cast aside for a celebrity who annoys established fans, is irrelevant to the target audience, and simply underperforms in the role. Frank Welker in the first Bay Transformers and Welker and Matthew Lillard in Scoob!

It is kinda ironic that Lillard was a celebrity first but that was a special circumstance. And it doesn't really matter because those movies sucked anyway. The characters and actors have much better showcases elsewhere.  

It's also annoying when you get a character in the movie, for example, who will never be heard from again because the celebrity voice is too big for series television. I thought Emily Blunt did great in My Little Pony but my daughter loved Tempest and was bummed she wasn't in anything else. (Except an unvoiced cameo in the final episode.)

Maybe it's a little thing but it does feel like vo actors are the red headed step children of entertainment.  It sucks because they are actors just the same,  they show incredible range, and are absolutely essential in making their characters iconic. It's not *just* the images. I understand sometimes they  *need* to recast but that's not to say it always works. For me, Loony Toons died with Mel Blanc and the Muppets with Jim Henson.

When he started talking about how another casino (Riviera) had a problem during it's implosion where a tower didn't come down, lost it and clicked off the crappy newscast. Can't even keep his facts straight!

My deep seated hatred for sports and anything related to it grew even more that day. Referenced problem with a tower he mentioned was a casino 3 months before the Riviera even closed, let alone was demolished!

Why are so many of us marginalized to the edges of society and paid peanuts or nothing when trash like that rakes it in and can spew all the incorrect facts they want and still collect a paycheck for it?","lte9cj3"

They are not supposed to work like :  Sees add, makes decision based on add, feels urge to buybuybuy, buys product advertised""*.

How it works is ""plaster half your brain with memories of ads -> later have a desire for general product category -> thing that pops into mind is more likely the primed brand name -> association with person you respect -> chance you pick that out of a slew of products you don't know either, but have never heard of"".

It's literally ""But you have heard of me"". Unless you as a user have a strong association with ""I will NEVER SUPPORT THAT BRAND specifically because of the ad"" it works.

Ads don't try to get you to switch brands if you are already happy. They are for switching TO the brand, if you have no preference before, or get dissatisfied with the product you used to buy. And in that sense celebrities exploiting their trust with the audience works. About as well as a family member telling you that they always used ""enter detergent 15"" and that it is better than the other brands.

*) But it can ""remind"" users of a desire in general, but that is not brand targeted (aka either ""oh, coffee... I can go for one, I will make me one in the kitchen) or remind you ""oh I wanted to stock up on anyway"", in which case it's either already that brand, you just forgot.

* Theodore Roosevelt. He was prolific writer and his book on Navel Warfare in the War of 1812 is a masterpiece and is considered the seminal work in its field. He wrote 18 books total. He also was an editor for a magazine. But the man also climbed on Matterhorn for his honeymoon. He was the first American to be a Brown Belt in Judo. As governor of New York, he boxed with sparring partners several times each week, a practice he regularly continued as president until being hit so hard in the face he became blind in his left eye (a fact not made public until many years later) and was runner up in boxing tournament at Harvard. 

* Bill Bradley. Former US Senator who is also in the NBA Hall of Fame. He is also one of the select few(two total) to have an NBA Title, a EuroLeague Title, and an Olympic Gold Medal. Bradley graduated magna cum laude from Princeton after writing his senior thesis about Harry S. Truman's 1940 United States Senate campaign. He attended and graduated from Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship where he was a member of Worcester College. While at Princeton he led his team to the Final Four and was named the Most Outstanding Player an award that Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, etc have also gotten. The dude's free throw percentage was 87.4% in college and in the NBA it was 84%. The NBA record holder for best career free throw percentage is Steph Curry at 91.0%. 

* Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Fantastic basketball player and one of the best. Also, has written a lot and with his books, admits to having a co-author. His first book, his autobiography Giant Steps, was written in 1983 with co-author Peter Knobler. The book's title is an homage to jazz great John Coltrane, referring to his album Giant Steps. Others include On the Shoulders of Giants: My Journey Through the Harlem Renaissance, co-written with Raymond Obstfeld, and Brothers in Arms: The Epic Story of the 761st Tank Battalion, World War II's Forgotten Heroes, co-written with Anthony Walton, which is a history of the first black armored unit to fight in World War II.","ltc7frv"

> In a low, confidential voice, interrupted at frequent intervals by loud, petulant questionings from her listeners, she began an unenterprising and deplorably uninteresting story about a little girl who was good, and made friends with every one on account of her goodness, and was finally saved from a mad bull by a number of rescuers who admired her moral character.

> ""Wouldn't they have saved her if she hadn't been good?"" demanded the bigger of the small girls. It was exactly the question that the bachelor had wanted to ask.

> ""Well, yes,"" admitted the aunt lamely, ""but I don't think they would have run quite so fast to her help if they had not liked her so much.""

> ""It's the stupidest story I've ever heard,"" said the bigger of the small girls, with immense conviction.

> ""I didn't listen after the first bit, it was so stupid,"" said Cyril.

> The smaller girl made no actual comment on the story, but she had long ago recommenced a murmured repetition of her favourite line.

> ""You don't seem to be a success as a story-teller,"" said the bachelor suddenly from his corner.

> The aunt bristled in instant defence at this unexpected attack.

> ""It's a very difficult thing to tell stories that children can both understand and appreciate,"" she said stiffly.

The thing is, they're actually a pretty talented writer, but their stories are bogged down by moralizing and condescension -- they simplify their tweenaged characters in all of the wrong ways, and you can tell they lack respect for the readership that they desperately want to develop. 

I've tried talking to them about it in the least rude way possible, because they're passionate about the work and they take it really seriously, and we're in a critique group together. But they never really seem to wonder to themselves whether this stuff needs to change, or why they've been bombing the query process for two or three different consecutive novels. (I wanna say ""even though they go to every writers' conference in the region"", but I'm not convinced if that helps them or anyone.).

Talking down to your readers doesn't really work.*Exploring* and *discussing* issues does. Kids are people too, and they know when they're being condescended to. 

I write adult speculative fiction with a focus on exploring issues faced by marginalized groups, which will hopefully eventually turn into a career, and I think part of the reason that people seem to enjoy my writing in critique groups and stuff is that I don't waste time on stuff like that despite the basic subject matter.

Netflix has changed the industry, no doubt about it. Marketing budgets and marketing blasts 24/7 definitely have changed the industry. I agree with both of those things. That's one platform and studio though. 

I wasn't born until 1988, so I can't comment on how the movie industry and/or movie theaters were until maybe 2006 when I was discovering smaller budget films. So my experience comes from 2006 and on. I see distribution companies such as A24, Mubi, and Neon, putting out small budget films and/or very creative films consistently.

To go compare the Back to the Future with a modern film, I would say Poor Things sounds like a good comparison. It's weird as hell, and has star power behind it and did pretty well at the box office compared to the budget. It doesn't get the theater longevity as in 1985, but it doesn't to appear to have been limited in any creative sense.

Yeah there's a lot of mass market stuff on Netflix and in theaters to saturate the market. There's also of plethora of excellent movies made on small budgets every year that are wildly creative. If the argument is that they don't get theater time compared to the large budget films, then sure, but that has been the case for 20 years or longer. Well before the Marvel/Disney spam we see now. There's a lot of excellent and creative film being made every year despite that.","ltc8sh7"

Adam Sandler doing the same thing for all of his movies as well. The Guy Ritchie film with Jason Statham ""Wrath of Man"" also had at least 3 prominent actors that starred on Burn Notice as well; the Producer picks the Agency and then they make calls to the people they know.

Unless you are actively avoiding the brand, you are more likely to buy something advertised to you.

This was the case for me about 20 years ago as well. 

Smaller films aren't seeing the screen time in theaters that large films are. That just is how it's always been for me, so I just don't really understand the shift.

I regularly see movies in theaters (despite the experience sucking) to support smaller budget films. I saw 10 films last year that had $50m or less budget last year, some on opening weekends. A lot of times most of the theaters were near empty. So it's really hard for me to even understand why a theater would keep those films showing on a screen.

I go to special 1 night screenings for Ghiblifest, or re-releases of older films. A lot of times they're empty. 

Disney/etc marketing definitely drowns out the smaller films from getting any attention, but again, that's how commercials and magazines were 20 years ago too. Back then it was all word of mouth. At least in 2024 I'll get an Instagram ad for a small budget film.","ltcargy"

Even if it’s minor. Someone who likes Jack Black will be more motivated to bring their kids to the movies to see Kung Fu Panda. It also makes these children’s movies a little more tolerable for some people.

I'm aware that it would be naive and poor business sense to say 'no TV tie-ins or celebrity authors ever'.


What frustates me is when celebrities, who already have a platform far bigger than 99% of authors, are given even more visibility in the form of promotion or shelf space. Especially in the context of their books being translated into other, minoritised languages. Walk into some bookshops in non-English speaking communities and you would be forgiven for thinking that there is no body of native literature- because so many of the books in shops are translations of English best-sellers. I noticed this on a recent trip to Norway. Same titles, same authors as an English library,  but translated to Norwegian. 


If the biggest book sellers won't stock original titles written in native languages, to the casual browser it creates the misleading impression that those books simply don't exist. Most bookshops stock only 1-5 copies of many books, and they can return unsold books. Instead, they take the easy option of stocking a known name released by a big press. 


There are some real gems published by smaller presses, in many different languages,  that never get any shelf space because it's allocated to David Walliams and his ilk. 


Thank goodness for smaller, independent book shops that showcase a wider range of storytellers and allow readers to get a real glimpse of the wealth of books beyond the best-seller lists.","ltcdu4j"

I certainly prefer Nabokov or Joyce's flourishes over Hemingway's directness, but that's taste. I am noting, though, that each allowed their art to speak for itself. Style guides suggest one avoid excess use of adjectives in no small part because it's impossible to make something stand out if everything is written in the extreme. Some dramas allow the reader to gloss over apocalyptic tragedies; some cause the reader to cry over the death of a mouse. Here we encounter a ""confidential voice"" that was ""interrupted at frequent intervals"" by ""loud, petulant"" voices. I can infer frequency and petulancy. I want a story, not adjective salad. I am not an idiot lecteur, but I shouldn't be the one trying to construct the scene. ""Unenterprising and deplorably uninteresting""? *Unenterprising* alone is excessive, but ""deplorably uninteresting"" is unenterprisingly, deplorably, uninterestingly redundant given the definition of *unenterprising*. Describe the character and allow the reader the respect of their own intuition. ""[W]ith immense conviction""? The character's words stand on their own; they don't need to be embellished by the author's self-conscious desire to convince the reader of their intelligence. ""[M]urmured repetition""? Come. It doesn't even make sense in its own context. It all screams ""Look at me! I even understand college-level vocabulary!"" Authors—or any artist—should never prioritize their craft as a dim-witted status signal, nor should any innocent reader be taken for such a fool as to fall for it.","ltk9w5o"

The Boy and the Heron was my favorite movie last year, I´m glad I was able to catch that one in cinema. Big Lebowski and Apocalypse Now were also fantastic re-releases experiences but there are others I have missed. I should subscribe to newsletter, its just that theres so much spam in my mailbox I might miss it lol. Need to clean that out.

>I just personally don't see how it's any different than 20 years ago.

Since I don´t live in the US, i cant speak for my personal experience about that more than the reports from the newsite how cinemas are on their knees and Disney is taking bigger and bigger cuts to push out the competition. But maybe its just same old same old, I´ll take your word for it.

However where I live I have noticed a big shift the last 10 years. Back then I only went to the big chain cinema and you could see all kinds of films there. Before showing blockbusters they´d have trailers for brazilian, korean, danish etc. cinema that I never would´ve known about or watched. Now thats all gone, they only show movies with 100+ milion budgets and their incestous trailers about another studio movie that looks exactly the same. The mid budget movies are gone and to watch local, international and indie movies you have to go to an indie theater. Now thats almost always where i go to watch movies.","ltcfmo5"

The entire creative industry is already utterly fucked for ordinary people.

AI is only going to steal the 1% of people's jobs who grew up with rich enough parents that they could afford not to work while pursuing their acting career. Same with music, art etc. It can recreate the drivel or something that already exists but it can't replace genuine talent. Or else are we admitting that art is only a set of technical skills and not an expression of our humanity...? I mean, we have to make up our mind on that? Tracy Emin or Yves Klein or Miro's (or fuck even Dali's) work is infinitely more interesting than worlds of AI-generated photorealistic gubbins despite the fact that TECHNICALLY it could have been ""done by anybody"", including AI?
