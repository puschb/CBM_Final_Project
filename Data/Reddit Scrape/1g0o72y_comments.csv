Del Ray is one of the handful of publishing names I recognize (Capstone, Scholastic, Penguin Random House, Simon and Schuster) .  I did not know anything about the person behind it, only that as a publishing company they produced less questionable fantasy books than what I grew up with.  Like sure, Lord of the Rings was good, but some of the Xanth novels had some content that might raise the eyebrow of a elementary school kid...

From the article.

As Del Rey is much larger than just fantasy (heavily impacting the acceptance of SF too), it seems she would get the credit for setting up the overall Renaissance but he literally built the fantasy wing, so it's good to recognize him too.","lrabf3o"

Edit: To be clear, the headline is talking about revolutionizing the fantasy genre, which wasn't the part of the imprint that she was editing.

She handled marketing, which, in book publishing, essentially is getting the books in visible places in bookstores and distribution which is making sure you have enough books and they get to where they need to be.

Editors in that age were the taste makers.  The ones who decided to take a shot on an author and help them hone their craft. The editors were the ones who decided which manuscripts to pick up.  That wouldn't have been her decision for this particular line.

For the fantasy line, which is what the article is mainly about, she was *not* the most influential figure in that venture.

She isn't overlooked. She is literally one of the best editors to have ever lived.  She just wasn't the editor on that specific line.

She's portrayed as shy and inexperienced, but she likes F'nor. So he initiates sex to ""help"" her. It's shown that she is initially interested but tries to stop things going to actual sex. He's then surprised when she ""tries to fight him"" when he does it anyway. He overpowers her and then, because she's fighting him, ""he wasn't gentle but he was thorough"" (that disgusting sentence is burned in my brain years later).


This is never shown to be bad, on the contrary she decides she loves him and they stay together, with her being raped somehow making her more confident.


This sort of thing happens throughout the series. A lot of it is couched in euphemistic language, but as an adult reading it you notice how often it happens - not just that there's no explicit consent, but that there's (explicitly or implicitly) **nonconsent**.","lrd910s"

That's what you said.  I'm not sure how many people actually care who *founds* something. They care more about what they've done, and for an editor, that's about who they've edited.  I'm also fairly certain had this been an independent venture, she would have simply incorporated with her husband as co-founder.

As it was, she hired her husband in a role at Ballantine.  As she was a senior editor, when she was given her own imprint, she brought her husband along with her.  This was a subsidiary given to her by a parent company, not something that she just thought up and made for herself.  Lester was an employee by a technicality.
