"lvfggnf","JRCSalter","2024-11-04 22:54:54 UTC","Whenever a character is introduced, I spend time fixing them in my mind.

A good writer will give you one or two noticeable features of their appearance or personality that makes them distinct from other characters.

Rather than trying to remember their name, try to remember the context in which you're introduced to them, and the memorable aspects of them. This way, when you come across the character in the future, you may not remember their name, but when they mention something that reminds you of that context, or the author mentions their noticeable aspect, then you can remember who they are.

Trying to remember names of a large cast of characters early on isn't as easy as remembering the context and these memorable features.

It's similar to how you start a new job. You don't know everyone's name just yet, but you can still remember that guy with the glasses and bleached blond hair, or the woman who always has her hair tied up in a bun, or the guy who helped you navigate the unfamiliar software.",""

If a character shows up before they're named but I get the sense they're Important, I write them down like this:

- Eco Comrade, engaged /r/book reader, appears (10), named (15)

If I get an extra name that's important, I just tag it along at the end:

- Eco Comrade, engaged /r/book reader, appears (10), named (15), also Cool Reader 1337 (17)","lve4c6n"

The downside is you kinda have to figure out that a moment is important when it happens to be able to bookmark it. I do it with new characters and dramatic scenes or lines.","lve64xl"

""Hey, hold on, I don't remember this Jeff guy, but it sounds like I should know who he is?""

and have the thing tell me:

""He was mentioned earlier in the book as the on-and-off boyfriend of Gina, when she complained about him only texting her when he was drunk.  They have shared custody of a cat called Archibald.""","lve64xl"

The teacher said that there were something like 100 active characters, all with (to us) confusing long Russian names, usually 3 names each, with an active nn. I used a piece of lined paper to keep track of them, and wrote really small. Fantastic book, but you really have to work for it.","lveg2kn"

"lvjfhhp","JRCSalter","2024-11-05 15:56:22 UTC","Almost all problems a reader has is related to the author.

It is the author's job to make the story clear, and if the reader has trouble following that, then the author has failed. Unless of course the author is deliberately trying to confuse the reader; something that needs to be done with extreme care.

I feel this is why a lot of older works suffer, as they weren't all that careful about introducing characters. War and Peace is a great example of this. Loads of characters introduced in the very first chapter, and you still don't know who any of them are.

Les Misérables is, on the other hand, a fantastic example of a classic work introducing characters and concepts with the proper weight and memorability to the point that Hugo often tells you what character is in the scene without even telling you their name.

Dickens is also great with memorable characters.","lvj66k0"
