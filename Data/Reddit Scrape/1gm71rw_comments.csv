Second, stuck in jail for a bit, and the library had it on the shelves.  Not sure if it was jail, or just being old and having seen a greater amount.  Much better read.  Likely voluntary reading vs being forced by an authority figure.

Time to appreciate the complexity of Tolstoy's writing, and the challenge of writing in multiple languages simultaneously.  Depth of knowledge to appreciate the complexity of the Napoleonic Wars, and the scale of the combatants across the landscape involved.  Personal experiences to at least slightly grasp the sorrow of Alexander looking upon the horrible waste of 1000's throwing their bodies into the hail of muskets meaninglessly.  References to Napoleon and what his time on Earth to France and Europe, and how meaningless his death was on an island of isolation in the middle of nowhere.

Jane Eyre*
Ask the Dust *
City of Thieves *

A guy who loved Bukowski told me about Fante, Fante was Bukowski’s favorite writer. So I had preconceived notions. But they’re not similar in the way they write. Fante can get across a lot of emotion without being at all flowery or unnecessarily wordy about it. Every word belongs on the page. And Fante’s self-important, deeply flawed, overly dramatic protagonist—Arturo Bandini—just really came alive for me in a way that no other fictional character ever has.","lw4auu5"

I believe it was written in serial form for a newspaper, so it's a bit like binge watching a good Netflix show.","lw0f2m0"
"lw0g75g","stayingempty1","2024-11-08 02:31:06 UTC","It does seem to be quite polarizing in that it is life changing for some and simply a huge nothing burger for others. 

I typically like to go into classics blind and form some opinions before taking on supplemental reading, but for East of Eden there is so much depth - in the sense of biblical parallels and exploration of archetypes that I was ill versed in - that I found reading other analyses and critiques enriched my experience quite a bit. To each their own, however!","lw0cr99"

I know there was a fairly popular movie adaptation, too. Somehow have avoided it. Thanks for the heads up!","lw19gz7"
"lw55p0m","Puzzleheaded_Size214","2024-11-08 20:54:10 UTC","Cool cool. Will put Fante on my list. Always liked Bukowski, mostly bc of Mickey Rourke's portrayal in Barfly(speaking of lists, probably off the top of my head a top 10 fav overall movie-certainly my fav Rourke one((top 3 Rourke flicks being Barfly, Diner, The Wrestler)) Only read one of Bukowski's books, the mailman one. Only read half of it, can't remember why I put it down, but I remember liking it.

And forgive me nerding out another list, my 5 books all time(off the dome-subject to change, naturally)- Infinite Jest, Middlemarch, Of Human Bondage, Roots, Trinity(read when I was 16yo)","lw4xbup"

Like if I wanted to know everything about the movie Jurassic Park? Without going down a rabbit hole. I realize I could try this out on my own, but rather learn from someone who knows what they're doing. Thanks for your time.","lw4gn7i"
"lw49kw7","Puzzleheaded_Size214","2024-11-08 18:13:57 UTC","Surprisingly put EoE down about a 3rd of the way through it. I liked the writing & story well enough but then iirc it started in on good but of religiosity exposition. I'm a pretty tolerant atheist but just didn't feel like indulging given so many other books to read, time is valuable, etc. Same thing happened w The Brothers Karamozov.🤷","lw0g75g"
"lw4qoec","VokN","2024-11-08 19:38:13 UTC","Genuinely you just Google “topic + wiki” and something should come up

It’s usually fanmade though so modern fantasy books, shows, games with lots of lore and Easter eggs are more common than classics

But even then this one has 6k pages s, but I imagine a good chunk are just “x happened in this movie, this is the family tree, list of every spinoff video game” etc

"lw58ipn","Puzzleheaded_Size214","2024-11-08 21:08:24 UTC","Yeah, it definitely wasn't the religiosity itself that turned me off, but something generally about the writing. Can't remember what. I really dug the 1st 100pgs Was cpl yrs ago.

I get down w plenty of religious stuff, particularly music. Some Xmas songs. Once In Royal David's City's straight up brought me to tears more times I can count. It's the basic story of the birth of JC. Lots of religious folks are delightful too. We just don't often discuss their ridiculous doctrine.","lw51oyy"
