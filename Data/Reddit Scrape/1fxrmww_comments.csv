I don't like answers like this. The national character is generally a reflection of what a person imagines more than the country. So this tells us the stereotypes this author has about those places, it doesn't tell us anything about those places. This is what she associates with those countries. 

I'm sure the US did have a worse reaction but I don't think it's because Canada is an ""anxious country"" that ""ask themselves questions"" in a way significantly different to other countries, I think a lot of people say Britain or France or Germany are countries also ""guilty"" of this in stereotypes. I also don't think Britain attitudes towards 21st century books are mainly a reaction to 17th century puritanism. First of all the Victorians and Edwardians were plenty prudish, sexist and full of weird assumptions about the world (especially upper class), some of the people reading the book in 1985 had grandaprents who grew up during a time women didn't have the vote and it was fought for partly through bombing campaigns and extremism. Also some of the upper class women only thought women of the right age and class should have the vote, not poor women or young women. Of course plenty of sexism, including ""get back to the kitchen"" type stuff, in 1980s Britain in business and society at large. The idea that people in Britain in 1985 would see religious and political mistreatment of women as something so ridiculous to believe that the social commentary went over their head seems rather a stretch. 

In terms of Cromwell and Puritanism it's also a bit weird. Puritanism is reactionary by modern standards but it's more complicated historically. For example the most radical social progressives in England at the time were Puritans or Puritan-adjacent. This even extended to some, limited but radical for the time, women's political organisation and contribution. Women like [Katherine Chidley](https://spartacus-educational.com/Katherine_Chidley.htm) are pretty important. And the Levellers themselves were pretty Puritan and, although still regressive by modern strandards, had progressive attitudes for the society they lived in. It's not that Puritans weren't sexist but that society in general was sexist and singling out the Puritans has more to do with post-restoration propaganda than it does Puritans being singely awful to women in comparison to other groups at the time. Anyway while these events are massivley important to British history they aren't really taught in schools, aren't big focusses of pop history, so don't loom large in the ""national psyche"". History and politics nerds are the only people who talk about this stuff at all.

Radical reilgion in the eyes of women Levellers justifed the idea ""our creation in the image of God, and of an interest in Christ equal unto men, as also of a proportionable share in the freedoms of this commonwealth"" as much as it justifed women being unequal in the eyes of the majority at the time. If we don't take note of this, and project modern conflicts and ideas back over centuries, it warps our understanding of history.","lqom204"

Having a supportive partner isn't ""the patriarchy."" We both benefit from his family's class privilege (he's a third generation college-educated engineer, I was the first in my family to attend college and come from generations of poverty).

The fact that society doesn't value the labor of writing is the problem. The fact that writing specifically about feminist issues like I did is especially underpaid is the *actual* patriarchy.

The advice Atwood received was to give up writing and become a wife. *That's* the patriarchy.

I was actually only pointing out that in this era having a partner offering to pay to support you for an entire year while you live out your passion project is a privilege that is almost exclusively extended to women. Having more than a year to do so is a profound luxury.

That interpretation is largely due to the gender difference, though. If someone said that to *you,* a male, you could quite reasonably assume they meant you'd be ""better able to pursue your goals"" if you simply found a partner who was well-off and willing to support you. 

But because people have been saying that to women for hundreds of years in order to dissuade them from pursuing education and careers at all, it doesn't sound that way when people suggest women just find a well-off man to support them.

>I would imagine her reasoning to be more along the lines of, ""We women have it hard, so we should take any chance to get a leg up...

You can imagine anything you want, but you're making a lot of assumptions. She didn't ""have it hard,"" her husband was ""bad in other ways,"" and she certainly wasn't recommending I find a man from some feminist motive.","lqt8mnp"

It sounds wonderful to say someone else will pay your way while you pursue your goals without worrying about money. But the fact is that these goals might not come to anything. Atwood was trying to build a career in which she could support herself no matter what. Telling someone to stop doing that and just marry someone with money and focus on creative pursuits instead is horrible advice. This seems so obvious to me that I'm confused what people here are misunderstanding about it. Going to school or building a company is not a good example. This advisor was telling her to not go to school and just work on her writing. To use the analogy, think of a different field. Let's say you were hoping to be a software developer or something like that and you were working a beginning job in that field or in school to work in that field and some advisor tells you to just quit and marry a person who will support you so you can stay home and focus exclusively on developing software freelance. It's possible it will work out great and you'll make the big bucks. But it's most likely that you will be isolated, cut off from the industry, opportunities and networking you would've gotten, and if your great freelance work fails, you're flipping burgers or dependent on that person forever. 

Then there are the more subtle aspects of what it does to a couple when one is a sole breadwinner,  especially in the 1960s and especially with the gender dynamic. It's his money, he's supporting her, what are her contributions to the relationship, what are his expectations, what choices do they both have if things don't work out?

Not to mention the obvious fact that she was not already married so this advisor is telling her to make her future financial support the defining feature in a search for a marriage partner. It's just nuts.","lqt8mnp"

Youre going to have to back up the claim that this is almost exclusively available to women. It is correct that there are still more men than women who are primary breadwinners but the women are almost never doing passion projects at the time. They are raising children. Also in the case of the OP, she was not simply working on a passion project. She was building a career. It's pretty common for people to support their partners while they go to school or do internships etc so I think to get good stats on this, you'd have to compare that by gender rather than just ""passion project"" which would be harder to quantify. My guess is that there are actually more husbands in this role than wives for all the obvious reasons (men tend to be the older partner, they tend to earn more, they tend to not be primary caregivers to children and elderly which makes them less likely to be changing careers on adulthood) but it's certainly not uncommon for wives to support husbands through similar transitions.

As for the industry, writing has been one of the careers more available to women for centuries, it's an old story and plenty of famous people have written about it. The point of the other poster is that feminist writing does not pay as well as other kinds of writing which to me likewise seems pretty obvious and mundane.

I ask this because you frame a husband‚Äôs career being enabled by the wife handling the child care.  It frames the mother as a third party of a family.

"lr1u9p4","Deleted","2024-10-09 05:23:39 UTC","I don't know why you are looking at it as a competition in the first place. Ideally it's a cooperative situation in which both people help each other share a happy life. The fact is that there is domestic labor involved in life and someone has to do it if you want a healthy life. If you have children, that domestic labor significantly increases.  If you want to have a career and a family, then one or the other will suffer if you try to do both on your own. There are a lot of ways families arrange this but the one in question is that one partner does the domestic labor while the other does the wage labor. 

Yes absolutely the person doing the wage labor is enabled in their career by the person doing the domestic labor. I don't even see what's confusing about that, it's simply a statement of fact. If the person doing the domestic labor did not exist then the wage laborer would either not be able to do their job or the domestic labor would simply not get done and their life would fall apart. The latter is increasingly a reality and it shows in our society. That person is more often the wife (though as I said there are plenty of other ways people can organize their families including hiring out the labor). You need to explain how this makes the wife in this situation the third party. To me it seems you are placing value judgements on objective statements but maybe I misunderstand you. Regardless, I'm not concerned with value judgements, that is a separate question. 

As for these things being transactional, we live in a society in which selling your labor for wages is the only way that most people can survive. We must compete with others who are also selling their labor. However wage labor is not the only labor that exists in life. So if one person in a marriage does this other labor while the other person gets wages for years then again it is a simple matter of fact that the wage earner will have more ability to survive and live with freedom in the world since they are earning money and growing a career while the other person can only survive in the world with the money their partner earns. It puts them in a position of being financially dependent on the wage earner. This is true whether or not one or both of them are happy with their work and their lives or not. Their desires and levels of happiness or comparative hardships or whatever are irrelevant to this fact, it's a separate question as I said. This is also why there are legal processes determining how to share and divide property in a marriage which is a legal contract. You can call this transactional or not, this is how our system works and I don't see any good that could come of pretending things work differently. 

I think again the problem is that you are mixing up value judgements with objective facts. People can be happy or not in all sorts of arrangements. The question of one poster was who is more likely to financially support a dependent spouse. The question of the other was who is more likely to enable another spouses career. These are different questions though they often overlap, and it's why talking about arrangements like this is tricky. Your own question seems to be about who is happy or has their desires met which is totally individual and subjective and irrelevant to the other two questions.","lr1mpim"
