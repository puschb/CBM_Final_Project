"lv5dgxw","jefrye","2024-11-03 08:11:10 UTC","In my mind, ""unreliable"" isn't limited to a character withholding viral plot-related information for the sake of a ""twist"": it also extends to more subtle writing. For example, a character insisting that they're perfectly happy with the way they've lived their life even though subtextually it seems like that might not be true (*The Remains of the Day*), or a character being unable to see/admit any of the giant red flags in their relationship (*Rebecca*). 

One of my favorite things about literature as a storytelling medium is being able to get inside a character's head and see the story from their perspective, so I absolutely love this in a novel.",""

Our trust of the art.
Best example is the classic of classics Agatha Christie's Poirot,  I won't say which it is because that's the point you need to have read a few before you get to it. You're in a comfort zone of who the narrators are and that you can trust them.
That's when they work.

"lv5v93j","PeteForsake","2024-11-03 11:29:57 UTC","A true unreliable narrator (rather than a ""twist"" narrator) should present the facts honestly while interpreting them unreliably. So you never feel cheated but can feel uncomfortable or intrigued. 

I'm not sure but I think the first such narrator where it's clearly a literary device rather than a fable is The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford. It starts as a kind of standard Pride and Prejudice style comedy of manners but then you realise he is covering for the fact that he has been cuckolded...and then it starts adding layers. It's a tough read at times as it's a classic rather than modern novel, but it's the original and best of the genre.",""
"lv694ab","MaxThrustage","2024-11-03 13:18:54 UTC","If your narrator is a character, then in my opinion they cannot be 100% reliable. Human beings all have their own lenses and biases, that's just an inevitable fact of life. I'm a huge fan of a well-executed unreliable narrator, and I think it works best when the unreliability is justified by the personality of the narrator. Pale Fire and Lolita by Nabokov, Baudolino and The Prague Cemetery by Umberto Eco, the Lemony Snicket books, The True History of the Kelly Gang, House of Leaves, and American Psycho are all great examples.

Where I think the trope often goes wrong is when the author is using to try to prove that they're smarter than their readers. Much like the twist ending or really any instance of ""X was actually Y all along"" it can be pulled out as a way to make a work *feel* smart, without the creator actually having to put the work in.

In short, I think the unrelatable narrator works best when it's a way to get to know the narrator better as a character, and not when it's used to try to ""trick"" the reader.",""

"lv6c6fd","TOONstones","2024-11-03 13:39:16 UTC","When done right, the unreliable narrator is wonderful. I only recently discovered Gillian Flynn, and I think that she's a terrific writer. But part of that is that she doesn't rely on the unreliable narrator for every story. 'Gone Girl' was very well done, but she took a different tack with 'Sharp Objects' and 'Dark Places'. Her strength is in her range, and the reader isn't expecting the unreliable narrator to be lurking just around the corner.

'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger. Holden Caulfield is absolutely unreliable. It's pointed out on page one, although many readers (myself included) miss it on the first reading. Many people think of Holden as a ""jerk"", but try reading it again through the lens of a kid who just has no clue what's going on in the world around him. Someone who can't even conceive of another viewpoint than his own. He's not unreliable out of malice, but out of immaturity and myopia.

>!'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'!< by Agatha Christie is another good example of the unreliable narrator. I won't say any more so as not to spoil the ending, but treat yourself to a reading of it if you never have. 

And then there's - what is, in my opinion - the masterclass. 'Lolita' by Vladimir Nabokov. Read it and trust the narrator. Reread it and doubt the narrator. Read it again and try to determine what is most likely. The book is a stunning achievement in making the reader question how he feels about the character of Humbert Humbert.",""
"lv6ex88","TOONstones","2024-11-03 13:56:33 UTC","Could every first-person narrative be considered unreliable? At least to some degree?

The plot itself could've had a lot more complexity and depth if Collins had gone for third person omniscient narrator but I LOVE that she chose to do it first person.

The reason it works is the fact that he's not simply unreliable, but seriously mentally ill, is a slow realization for the reader.  And it changes the reader's perspective on the previous chapters of the book. 

 The book had been building a narrative of an abusive institution staffed with sadistic people.  And eventually you have to ask if that if any of that was even true.

If I don't figure it out, I instead end the book with a feeling of having been lied to.

There are books where it works. Maybe because there are no lies, just unrelated omissions that expose preconceptions, or because the rest of the book is just so good.

My one big example is Salinger's classic Catcher in the Rye. I developed an instant distrust and dislike for Holden which ruined my experience. I use that example because it also shows how readers are different. 

Your example of Gone Girl is interesting though, because the author actually makes sure we distrust the narration, making it a possible double or triple bluff.

Novels narrated in the first person are really good at this because it often lulls the reader into just taking the POV character's perspective as how the world is, and the rare times it switches to someone else's POV you realize oh, the hero is actually a lot less charming when you aren't in their heads and you realize that they've spent the last four books not telling a soul their plans until the last possible second.

A great example of this is the video game *We Happy Few*. The game has you play as three different characters in campaigns one right after the other, and the player is presented with contradictory information about each protagonist and their interacting with each other, like what two characters argued about in one scene.

This isn't because they're trying to deceive the audience. It's because all three have quit an extremely potent mood-altering, hallucinagenic drug cold turkey and are clearly fucked in the head from years of legally-mandated drug abuse.

The opening is a perfect example of this, when first main character Arthur suddenly passes out from withdrawal and stops taking his Joy. He only starts to realise how badly the entire office is in disrepair when everything was perfectly upright and normal earlier^1, as well as wandering around and realising that things are *very* wrong, like a coworker who was ""On holiday"" is likely never coming back.

And then he goes to an office party where his coworkers are playing with a piñata right as the last of the drugs wear off. >!It's a dead rat. And when they bash it to pieces, they eat the rat's organs.!<

Also, something like this also happens in the webcomic *Family Man* by Dylan Meconis.

Main character Luther Levy is half-Jewish by heritage, something which he is extremely insecure about. This actually causes him to imagine his nose as being downright enormous as a sign of his insecurity about his own heritage and religious faith (he was raised Peitist).

In fact, when he is mistakenly led to briefly believe that other people are Jewish by descent like he is, he briefly imagines all of them with noses as utterly large as his own for a quick moment before he corrects himself.

And hilariously, if you read the author's earlier webcomic (which features an older Luthor as a side character), you know that his massive nose has *nothing* to do with his being Jewish. >!It's because he's a werewolf.!<

1: This is also a gameplay mechanic. As a stealth survival roguelike, you need to avoid letting others realise you're a Downer (someone who isn't taking their Joy) and one of the ways you can do so is popping a Joy pill or eating food which is drugged with Joy, which causes you to see the town of Wellington Wells as a happy-go-lucky, Sixties-era paradise instead of the rundown shithole it actually is. But if you take too much Joy, it's game over.",""

It acknowledges and embraces the shortcomings of the novel (ie we don't get a full picture of the character's life, only what the author selects), it doesn't excise information for a twist or for plot convenience, and the unreliability is a logical result of Stevens being a bit reserved, elderly, and naïve. He is, like most people, not fully self-aware rather than made unreliable because it is fashionable or easy. There is never a moment where the rug is swept and we are told things didn't happen that way, he is just aware he could be combining events or is unwilling to admit to himself he was undignified. Not fully knowing his thoughts and actions allows us to understand what it is like to be around Stevens (a man terrified of authenticity and vulnerability).

There is also a remarkable humility to his unreliability/selection of events - just as he understates his flaws (such as lacking the moral courage to stand up to Darlington, or sympathise with Miss Kenton), he equally must be understating his virtue and decency for why else would she have loved him?

"lv61evx","apt12h","2024-11-03 12:22:06 UTC","I also agree. I don't read books with a twist, because I find myself waiting the entire time for the twist or thinking...ah, this must be the twist. Subtle is better! : )","lv5dgxw"
"lvay4m4","mampersandb","2024-11-04 05:05:06 UTC","an artist of the floating world has another great ishiguro unreliable narrator. he frequently says “i don’t remember it like that” or conveniently glosses over stories with “it’s not worth mentioning”, etc. the unease with his honesty just grows through the whole book. it’s really masterfully done. you can really see how ishiguro was able to build up to remains of the day later","lv5dgxw"
"lv63chm","algy100","2024-11-03 12:37:17 UTC","I was trying to figure out how to say this because yes absolutely. It’s a spoiler to even tell people which book but it’s so good!","lv5icyh"

I've been enjoying picking it apart.  
  
As far as I can tell, Canner is unreliable in at least *three* ways: one of them is that he assumes you understand the world as it is, and of course you don't -- so he periodically refers to ""You all know how this turned out,"" and we don't.

And then he lies about things he sees: he lies about gender -- assigning genders to people in ways that reflect neither their biology or their assigned lack-of-gender -- and perhaps about characters' magic powers.

And then there's the big thing he doesn't bother to tell us but we learn from people around him.","lv5cp43"

Sorry if you don’t agree with it.","lv5eave"
"lv8c0cy","_Pohaku_","2024-11-03 19:53:48 UTC","It’s not about fiction vs truth as some universal constant. It’s about different characters (generally just the narrator but it can be more) knowing or believing something, and then also choosing to not state ‘the truth and nothing but the truth’ to the reader, such that there are multiple layers of truth.

As a minimum there is the objective truth, what the narrator believes to be the truth, and what the reader believes is truth based on what the narrator tells them.

The ‘theory of mind’ - the ability to understand that people may have differing perceptions of what is true - is a key part of human cognitive function. (I may be misremembering some of my psychology education many years ago, but I also think that not having this ability is a key indicator of autism in children.)","lv5eave"
"lv5ilzc","Frosty_Mess_2265","2024-11-03 09:12:12 UTC","My Dark Vanessa is one of the few books where I think the rape scene was absolutely necessary to the functioning of the plot and the story. Because WE, the audience, can flip back and see exactly what happened--Vanessa doesn't have that luxury. So we get to watch her gaslight herself in real time into believing it wasn't that bad, that she actually wanted it. And she does this over and over again. It's a very powerful message, and brilliantly executed, and it makes for a very effectively soul-destroying book.","lv5ev4n"
"lv9935i","Live_Angle4621","2024-11-03 22:44:49 UTC","To me that’s different subcategory than straight unreliable narrator if it’s only the characters inner life that’s not portrayed accurately (because of denial etc). But everything observed is accurate. ","lv683rl"

"lv6852f","MaxThrustage","2024-11-03 13:12:11 UTC","Yeah. Like, I straight-up do not believe Humbert about how Lolita's mother dies. There is no *evidence* that he's lying, but it's so convenient that I just can't believe him. And the fact that by that point we know we can't trust what he says... but, at the same time, there's no proof, and what he tells is *possible*.","lv5xf49"
"lvy21ob","intrepidcaribou","2024-11-07 19:08:13 UTC","But it's always uncertain as to whether he's lying or just delusional AF. That's what makes it good. It's possible to tell yourself a lie so many times that you start believing it.","lv5xf49"

"lv6dkgr","TOONstones","2024-11-03 13:48:05 UTC","Yes! One of my favorite misdirects in all of literature. On one hand, why would he lie about it? After all, he's already confessing to so much. Why disguise a murder when it won't do anything to make him look better?

But, on the other hand, I just don't believe him. You're absolutely right. It's just too convenient. And he's shown himself to be such a scumbag. He's certainly not above murdering to get what he wants.","lv6852f"
"lvad6ii","New-Temperature-1742","2024-11-04 02:34:58 UTC","I actually do think that Charlotte got killed by the car.  To me, it just kind of came off as a darkly comedic moment.  H.H. is probably going to kill her, but she immediately gets hit by a car before he has the chance to.  He is very clear about all the other horrible things he does, and already implies he wants to kill Charlotte, so I dont really see why he would lie about this one thing","lv6852f"
"lv6rwcd","onceuponalilykiss","2024-11-03 15:11:13 UTC","I mean the slapstick sequence at the end is also a deranged thing to claim as happening but why would he lie? So it's kinda unclear too.","lv6852f"

"lvb47wh","Marandajo93","2024-11-04 06:01:13 UTC","Dark places is one of my favorite books. I did, however, find the ending to be a bit unbelievable.

That is probably my favorite Jillian Flynn book.","lvb3hss"
"lvy2hqf","intrepidcaribou","2024-11-07 19:10:18 UTC","But that's the thing. he prides himself on being a scumbag above other scumbags. Pushing a woman in front of a car would be ""beneath"" him. He knows he is a reprobate, but he would rather die than admit to being ""common"".","lv6dkgr"
"lvbly8j","Savings-Dot-1681","2024-11-04 09:17:29 UTC","I always felt he gets more honest as the book goes along.

"lvc3tgc","onceuponalilykiss","2024-11-04 12:17:39 UTC","I think he *wants* you to think he gets more honest as he goes along, like he's playing at showing remorse.
