"ls1o9ph","onceuponalilykiss","2024-10-15 14:49:43 UTC","Because sci fi isn't actually just ""space battles"" and hasn't ever really been? The first sci fi novels were things like Frankenstein and HG Wells fare, not Star Wars. Then, especially since the 60s turn to more character driven sci fi, the idea that sci fi should be ""space and spaceships and space battles"" has grown increasingly detached from the reality of the genre. 

You want *a specific kind of sci fi*, and that's not the fault of the writers who realize there's much more to the genre.

I mean:

>It is good but feels heavily political and philosophical rather than sci-fi.

This is a ridiculous statement to make for a genre that's been political and philosophical since its inception. It's a bit like saying ""why isn't anyone writing novels? It's all philosophy and character thoughts instead of heroic jousts!""",""
"ls22pa4","OptimisticOctopus8","2024-10-15 16:07:29 UTC",">It is good but feels heavily political and philosophical rather than sci-fi.

Those two things are very closely linked to a lot of scifi because scifi is not, at its heart, usually about science. Instead, speculative scientific developments are used as a springboard for exploring what a changed world would look like. The answer is almost never ""the world is the same except with more cool stuff."" 

There's not even one historical example of a technological leap that didn't create massive changes. Farming changed everything. The domestication of animals changed everything. Every time a deadlier type of weapon was developed, it changed everything. The printing press changed everything. The harnessing of electricity changed everything. The telephone changed everything. The discovery of DNA changed everything. The internet changed everything. Sometimes, knowledge alone changes everything. 

""If we fiddle with this knob and maybe that knob over there, what happens? If we change the tech, how does society respond... and what kind of society would create such tech/make such scientific leaps in the first place?""

Novels all have underlying themes. The plot, characters, and everything else drive those themes forward (even if the theme is just ""love conquers all"" or something like that). Science fiction is particularly fertile ground for exploring political and philosophical themes, and it has done so more often than not since the genre first came into being. 

It's kind of like talk of AI right now. You can't have a serious conversation about AI without digging into philosophy (What is sentience? Is sentient AI possible? How would humans derive meaning from their existence if AI ever reaches a point where it can perform all the labor we currently perform?) and politics (Should the government restrict AI? *Can* it restrict AI in any meaningful way? To what extent can/will AI change the course of politics and culture in general? Will AI make companies even more powerful than they already are, and what will they do with that power? What will the government do if huge swathes of the population lose their jobs to AI - universal basic income, letting people starve?)

Bobiverse is comedic, so though I haven't read it, I imagine that's why it can get away with having less of a focus on philosophical and political themes.",""

It's not just in books, it's maybe even more pronounced in movies or TV series.  Science fiction examples which come to mind are movies like Ad Astra, which seemed like it could be a well made and realistic science fiction movie, but was really some 'man-drama' about the character and his father with nonsensical and irrelevant action sequences of 'space pirates' injected.  The War of the Worlds series was, while admittedly a series, terrible about this; it was like 90% poorly written, irrational family drama.  

I think that's not completely new, but seems increasingly common nowadays, as if literature is written by marketing teams for some demographic, by writers who copy/paste too much into their story based on too much careening through their head, or are written too much around 'relatability' as if everything needs to somehow 'affirm' the reader or somehow make it *about them*.  Just my speculation, but you don't see it in older 20th century science fiction (maybe Robert Heinlein gets into philosophy/politics, but that's homogeneous with the cerebral focus of scifi, always has been), and with 'fantasy' the older sources from which it recycles tropes are almost unrecognizable (for example, older legendary Icelandic sagas were *realistic*, yet fantasy tropes draw so much nonsense from them or Tolkien, etc.).  At some point literature/movies started tipping further that direction, so I find most genre-literature just too cringey and annoying.

edit: Just browsing Amazon filtering by ""science fiction & fantasy"" gives plenty of examples of what I mean.  A couple glaring examples of top sellers I just found seem to be ""Alpha's Unclaimed Mate"", by Gertty Rudraw, or ""Born For Silk"" by Nicci Harris.  They seem laser focused on whatever neuroses or emotional goings on of certain types of readers, while the stories are like 10th generation recycled tropes from other stories for flavor.",""

I mean it kind of was, in the sense we would call it scifi because it explained the 'fantastical' goings on to be realistic explanations at the time (i.e. galvanism, naturalism, etc.), but by that measure much of what people would call 'fantasy' today would be 'science fiction' too.  Like when Icelanders in the Middle Ages wrote about trolls, they believed those things were possible just as some 19th century people thought it possible resurrecting stitched together corpses with a lightning strike.  But it was also more focused on the horror aspects of trying to control nature, the Faustian or Promethean spookiness of the consequences, etc..  Beside the point either way.

>...in the decades preceding the 60s what was taking over was pulpy action or people focusing way too much on the technology versus what effects it would have on the actual people.

The... 1760s?  Or you mean to shift to talking about the change in the 1960s?  Sure, you're not answering the question though.  It shifted towards characters away from, you say action or 'the technology'.  Isn't that kind of focus, on the sort of fascination with naturalistic explanations for seemingly impossible things (..or something like that) kind of the direction in which science fiction diverged from just general fiction as a genre?  That's the point, it is less the focus in recent books, more often the focus is emotional melodrama. 

>I'll take a single Le Guin novel over all the space battle shit or being masturbatory about the ""

Maybe you will edit in whatever you were trying to say here, but how could the 'science fiction' driven science fiction be more 'masturbatory' than stuff like ""Born For Silk: A Dark Love Story (The Cradled Common)"", which Amazon suggests as a top reader in science fiction, or any of the examples of the kinds of stories the poster seems to be referencing?  It would either be equally masturbatory, if meant figuratively, or far less masturbatory if meant more literally since half of what I see as 'science fiction' now is basically romance or just written to affirm whatever particular self esteem issues/emotional selling point seem marketable.  [It's not about it being 'character driven' as much as 'book sales' driven.  ]","ls7ui41"

Because you wrote this, as if what you were were saying about the 60s was logically connected to Frankenstein, and the nearest '60s' preceding that would be the 1760s, but you seemed to be just jumping from Frankenstein to 1960s science fiction in the same sentence as if they were connected.
