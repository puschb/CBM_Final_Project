Oliver is in Australia promoting his latest cookbook, Simply Jamie, but it is his decision to join a growing flock of celebrity children‚Äôs book authors with a 400-page fantasy novel for primary school-age children that has come under fire.

The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Corporation (Natsiec) has described Oliver‚Äôs book Billy and the Epic Escape, which has an Australian subplot, as damaging and disrespectful, and has accused the celebrity of contributing to the ‚Äúerasure, trivialisation, and stereotyping of First Nations peoples and experiences‚Äù.

The book features a young First Nations girl living in foster care in an Indigenous community near Alice Springs who gets stolen by the novel‚Äôs villain.

Oliver and his publisher, Penguin Random House UK (PRH UK), have conceded to Guardian Australia that no consultation with any Indigenous organisation, community or individual took place before the book was published.

Billy and the Epic Escape, a humorous fantasy adventure novel, is set in England but involves a subplot where a wicked woman with supernatural powers teleports herself to Alice Springs to steal a child from a fictitiously named community called Borolama. She wants an Australian Indigenous child to join her press gang of stolen children who work her land because ‚ÄúFirst Nations children seem to be more connected with nature‚Äù. The adults responsible for Ruby, a young girl who lives in foster care and likes to eat desert bush food, are distracted by the woman‚Äôs promise of funding for their community projects. Once abducted, Ruby tells the English children who rescue and repatriate her that she can read people‚Äôs minds and communicate with animals and plants because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the indigenous way‚Äù. She also tells them she is from Mparntwe (Alice Springs), yet uses words from the Gamilaraay people of New South Wales and Queensland when explaining her life in Australia.",""

He went off to do a show in America, and spent his time fist-bumping black guys and calling them ""bruvvah"", while constantly saying, ""Us blacks will understand this technique."" I have to say, the Americans were visibly surprised but entirely polite about this on camera.

Later he went on Who Do You Think You Are to have his ancestry traced, and it turned out the swarthy ancestor had been a Portuguese slave trader. He shut up about his exotic ancestry after that, thank goodness.

I'm not going to touch on the other offensive parts of this book, but I want to give context to non-Australians who might not know why this is so incredibly offensive.


If you haven't heard of the Stolen Generation,¬†the short of it is that the Australian government forcibly removed many First Nations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders) children from their families from 1905 to 1967 (or even later in some areas). Between 1 in 3 and 1 in 10 First Nations children were taken from their families¬†


It is a terrible mark on our history and not something to just slap into a fantasy novel. Especially considering how recent it was.


As someone who is not First Nations,¬†I personally wouldn't even consider writing a fantasy novel with a plot/subplot on such a topic, let alone do it without proper consultation/sensitivity readers.",""

The fact that that no indigenous person was even consulted about it makes it yet another example of white people trying to tell indigenous stories with no indigenous input.

As far as conspiracy theories go? It's amazingly harmless... and honestly quite wholesome:

\\* Some think that since Tabitha has helped out Stephen in the past (ie, rescuing *Carrie*) and still does to this day (reviewing drafts), she's taking more of an active role - especially since Stephen has a bunch of other project(s) that are taking his time and/or to allow Stephen more time to work on passion projects.

\\* Some think that Stephen is having Tabitha's work submitted under his name so it can reach a wider audience and to ward off bad faith criticism of ""Oh this only got published cause you're Stephen King's wife."" (Seriously - just look at how much shit Paolini got because his parents ""owned the publishing company"".)

\\* Some think, related to the above, that it's an experiment / method to troll publishing companies and readers alike. Ie, ""If this were credited to Tabitha, you'd probably look over it, but because it's credited to Stephen? You'll read it and it'll sell way more.

- ‚ÄòExperts‚Äô and ‚Äòexpert‚Äô sources can be biased/prejudiced at any time. After all, I‚Äôm currently a medical student, and we are often educated on old racist medical practices that were once thought to be ‚Äòobjective science‚Äô too. Basing all your information about a culture on someone who doesn‚Äôt have the lived experience of said culture is exactly why Rick Riordan ended up in this mess. If he had just directly consulted a Cherokee individual about the feathers, he would have found out the truth of how they‚Äôre actually used in modern day and wouldn‚Äôt have used stereotypes. That‚Äôs literally all he had to do. 

- I‚Äôm sorry, but this reply feels like a very whiny and immature response that makes it sound like white authors are suffering because of their misguided attempts to include diversity. Well-written diversity is not that hard. After all, a show like Avatar the Last Airbender was also created by white men, but see how much praise and appreciation the show gets on average even 20 years after its release, because those white men put in the effort to create something authentic and sincere to the cultures that they borrowed from. Just do your due diligence with your research and you will literally be fine. My goodness.

- Very rarely do authors suffer significant consequences for not having diversity in their books. At most, people complain about them on social media and their books aren‚Äôt included on any diversity lists. Authors who have all-white casts continue to do just fine. Even in Riordan‚Äôs case, his career hasn‚Äôt suffered much at all.

So first, if it is true (and it seems pretty preposterous), this would be pretty fucking sexist on the part of King. Taking credit for your wife's work and cutting her out of it is a time honored literary tradition.


Second, it would absolutely be true that Tabitha would receive special treatment from publishers due to her proximity to King. Nepotism is real.


Third, people saying this hasn't stopped Joe Hill.


But back to the quote I put in. Paolini is such a weird example for you to use. He was a child, and his novel was incredibly plagiaristic and unoriginal. And I am NOT referring to Star Wars. I'm referring to the Belgariad by David Eddings. There are entire scenes that Paolini took from this series, though there is no word for word plagiarism that I recall. And even then, there are other aspects that lack originality.


Paolini would never have been published without receiving a lot more editing, at the absolute least, and may never have been published at all if his parents hadn't literally done it for him. To suggest that he received no benefits from his parents owning a publishing company when they literally published his book and funded his promotion of it is just patently ridiculous.


Nepotism doesn't mean the person benefiting has absolutely no skills or merits of any kind. It is a recognition that that they received benefits for being closely connected to relevant people, regardless of their degree of ""talent"".","lwcnfoj"

Regardless of how much power and influence that the U.S. holds on the global stage, the Greek gods are exactly that: *Greek*. There‚Äôs no conceivable reason as to why they would abandon their birthplace and ancestral homeland for the States when Greece is still literally right there and hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere. I saw the quote you responded with below, and honestly, the fact that the migration is explained by Greek Gods being on prominent display in US cities seems like a flimsy argument on Rick‚Äôs part. In what world would the country of Greece itself not have the most powerful displays of the gods that arose from the ancient civilization that basically birthed them? How is the Empire State Building a more important Greek symbol for the gods than the Parthenon, or the Gateway Arch a more important symbol than the Acropolis? 

I wouldn‚Äôt even say that I‚Äôm particularly passionate about this talking point, but I can see why it annoyed people. I understand that Rick only has experience living in the U.S. so he probably just decided to stick to what was familiar. But even then, he could have just called the Empire State Building a portal to the original Mount Olympus in Greece, instead of making up an explanation that sort of implies that America is the center of all things important. 

I‚Äôm not sure what the ultimate reason was for this explanation not making it into the recent TV show, but it wouldn‚Äôt surprised me if they were cautious about including this in there for social reasons.","lwciy1y"

Again, is it not!??? I'm having trouble identifying what your issue is here.

The gods' current residence in America is attributed to two facts: firstly, America's broad status as an inheritor of Greece's cultural legacy (""Western civilization""); secondly, America's current status as the greatest world power. Both of these facts are indisputably true. But more importantly, _neither of those facts are given moral significance_. There's not a single moment in the Percy Jackson series where you can find the Greek Gods defending the Iraq War or belittling Mediterranea. In fact, in that quote I shared, Chiron (who's the closest thing the series has to an objective ""wise old man"" archetype) explicitly alludes to the fact that the presence of the gods does not amount to moral authority.

And if you're disregarding that as ""random snark"", all I can say is that Rick Riordan presumably didn't think his book intended for ten-year-olds warranted a disavowal of anglo-supremacy with anything other than random snark.","lwcxmrv"

If the character was out there huffing petrol and stealing, yes this would be a concern worth addressing, because that feeds an actual stereotype with real world consequences for real First Nations people. But a child with a ‚Äòconnection to nature‚Äô who can talk to animals in a fucking kids book about magical adventures? Seriously? Grow up.","lwefdcs"

Quite frankly your take that ""Western culture isn't real"" is an incredibly bigoted one.

But for all we know they might well have been in Constantinople for a few centuries. Rick hasn't exactly written a comprehensive compendium of the history of where the greek/roman gods went over the millennium, just a few examples.

>and the Middle East, or the Southeastern provinces into Egypt or the Levant?

You are aware that in this universe the Egyptian Pantheon is real as well as the Greek one, right? Rick wrote a whole damn series in-universe about them.","lwfwmq7"

Again, why did the Greek gods move at all if all of the other pantheons stayed put? Why are they over the Empire State at all instead of down in the debt mines with Sakellaropoulou? There is no reasonable way of explaining it outside of imperialist propaganda installing various Western European countries as the successors of a culture they had almost nothing to do with.","lwgil6m"

Constantinople wasn't part of Western Civilisation now?

>Again, why did the Greek gods move at all if all of the other pantheons stayed put?

Because that's the premise of the story and the Urban Fantasy basis for it. Its fiction. 

The Egyptian Pantheon is also present in the US. But you'd know that if you'd actually read the books.

>There is no reasonable way of explaining it outside of imperialist propaganda installing various Western European countries as the successors of a culture they had almost nothing to do with.

And we're back to denying western culture as a thing again. You're a very racist person, I hope you know.","lwhrkn6"

""Actually, being mean to white people is the *real* racism!""

Pretty average take for a fantasy fan, ngl. Sorry I have more productive things to do with my time than reread a 20-year-old supermarket novel for children.

Again, if the Egyptian pantheon wasn't there either then why did they just abandon Egypt after Rome fell? There is no way of interpreting it except the idea that European domination of the globe and eventual expansion into America was somehow divinely ordained and no other part of the empire was important to them.","lwhx9l6"
