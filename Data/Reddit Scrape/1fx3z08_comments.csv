That's interesting what you say about the New Zealand accent. I don't know a dictionary that gives New Zealand pronunciations fully, but Wiktionary gives the Australian pronunciation of ""doll"" and the Australian and New Zealand pronunciation of ""pole"", but doesn't make them rhyme; curious.

This is... [extremely wrong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pitch_accent).

Not necessarily correct, though you're right for ""Kazuo.""  When written with Roman letters, two vowels in succession can instead indicate a long vowel, which in Japanese means you hold the sound slightly longer, rather than making it into a different sound.","lqk2gir"
