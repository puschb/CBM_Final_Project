There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. You can read other books at the same time, too, to give your brain variety.

Then there are people, who reading is basically a reflex at this point, and are willing to read anything as long as it is well written, even if it starts out slow or drags in some parts. 

I think I have DNF'd one book in the past like 5 years. One reason is that I'm pretty good at spotting the type of book that I will want to read, the other reason is that even if I don't  completely love a book, as long as the prose is good, then I'm usually going to get something out of it and enjoy it.

However, if ever I have issues finishing a book for whatever reason, I do have a technique that's been extremely helpful. I grab noise canceling headphones or earbuds and start listening to ambience music that relates to that particular genre.

"lsn9zej","wyltemrys","2024-10-19 05:47:24 UTC","I find that I'm more likely to do this with tv series, especially long-running series, than with books. I've lost count of how many shows I started (& loved), but never finished. I love the 'Limited Series' that have 5-10 episodes now, because I can usually get through them in a weekend, and then move on to something else next time I pick up the remote (which could be weeks or months later).

A big part of this is my approach to reading - almost exclusively e-books, and I keep my reading queue filled. Usually a couple fantasy/urban fantasy novels, a murder mystery or two, maybe a horror or spy/military novel. I'll read one book from each category (or author), then switch to a different category/author. This works really well when some of the series run 20-30 books. I can work through 5 or 6 different series, in rotation, but I'm not reading 20 or 30 books in a series in a row. Maybe I'll even mix a current bestseller or a re-read of an old favorite (or even an entire series) into the rotation.

Because I read 2-4 books a week, if I'm just not feeling a book on a particular day, I might switch to another in my queue, then go back to the first book & give it another go. Sometimes, a particular book/theme doesn't fit your mood on a given day - maybe your current book is dark, and you're having a bad day or two, so something lighter might fit better, or a book's prose is denser, or the plot is more complex,  and a day that only offers brief interludes for reading might not fit that particular book at that time, but if you put it off until your mood changes or you have larger blocks of time available, it is a better match & you can get more enjoyment out of the book/theme then.","lsfzvy0"

"lsp11n3","Real_Currency6695","2024-10-19 15:09:32 UTC","Same. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a tipping point in books that you have to get beyond before really understanding the ‚Äúmessage‚Äù or intent of the story. I try to hang in til I pass that point but if life is too hectic I sometimes put it down for later‚Ä¶ and revisit if I feel it‚Äôs still worth finishing (or sometimes switching to the audio version will work also). So few books really grab me from the get-go anymore - but there are also so many more ways to be distracted/interrupted! ü§®","lsgk3k9"
"lshqezh","sadworldmadworld","2024-10-18 07:15:21 UTC","Yeah, this is why the ""don't suffer through a book you don't like, there's plenty more"" advice doesn't work for me. It sucks, but sometimes it takes a lot of suffering and perceived mediocrity in the middle for the end to have a perspective-shifting impact (in the general sense, and in the sense that it often changes my understanding and appreciation for the mediocre middle). I DNF-ed my current ""favorite"" like 3 times before I made it all the way through.","lsgk3k9"

Tried watching the movies, same thing, I lost interest during Two Towers. This year I wanted to give the whole series another chance, so I read The Hobbit and really enjoyed it. I decided I‚Äôd try LOTR again. This time I made it 100 pages or so into Fellowship of the Ring and just could not go on. I dunno what it is, but it just can‚Äôt seem to hold me.","lsg6yhj"

"lsh2muw","cferrari22","2024-10-18 03:32:01 UTC","The book has an unreliable narrator, which can be really interesting and mysterious. This one, though, seems schizophrenic, sociopathic, hallucinating, or all three. Reading this book made me feel like I was, too. It was a very uncomfortable experience. A commenter below said it‚Äôs better once you finish the book and get the whole picture, so maybe I just chickened out.","lsgx6t2"
"lsg1fom","BVB_TallMorty","2024-10-17 23:33:52 UTC","True, but some of those books are designed to keep your attention with fast paced action. Pretty similar to social media in that way. Sometimes you find yourself unable to put a book down, but after you finish you realize the book wasn't even very good and it doesn't stick with you.

I've noticed my attention issues moreso in slow paced books for this reason. Even if it's a well written book and I'm interested in the subject","lsg0y43"
"lsn6t2n","wyltemrys","2024-10-19 05:15:46 UTC","I felt kinda that way about the Mayfair Witches series. It's been years since I read them, so I don't remember exactly where in the series I started to feel like I was slogging through a bit, but I believe it was when she crossed the storyline with the vampire novels that I became interested again (Merrick maybe?) & wanted to see how she pulled everything together. Also, a gf & I were both reading them, so I had someone to discuss them with & it kept me going where I might have considered dropping the series otherwise. However, now that I see that she'd written a few more books (New Tales of the Vampires), I'm not sure if I'm going to make the effort or not.","lsh1ije"

And I might have been a bit dramatic I must admit because it did have some good parts which are now escaping me. But at the least I learned something about what I don't like or something that I disagree with so I think it was still worth the read.

And to clarify I do put down some books but I genuinely believe there is something to learn from most books.","lshwex9"

I don‚Äôt mean to cause offence but it really does sound like something in you is forcing you to do something you‚Äôre not enjoying. 

That‚Äôs almost the definition of OCD.

If you‚Äôre enjoying the experience or feel the book has info that you‚Äôll benefit from, great. Stick with it. 

OTH, if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre just compelling you to finish it regardless then you might want to consider a different use for your time.","lsihg6q"
