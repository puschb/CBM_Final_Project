It starts with Anne’s spirit, maybe in purgatory but more of a place out of time and space because she needs time to heal from Henry’s betrayal. When she’s ready, she’s reincarnated. But while healing, she muses on all the lives she and Henry and have had together. They’re not always lovers; sometimes they’re enemies, sometimes they’re friends, frequently they’re lovers, but they’re so often together. But after being Anne Boleyn, she requests time apart so she gets a lifetime or two without Henry. 
     
I like the idea of reincarnation, because I feel like one lifetime is just not enough time for our spirits to learn everything they need, and I like the idea that your spirit has some say in the life you live, like if your spirit knows it needs to work on generosity so it chooses to live a life of poverty, or maybe a life of great wealth and hopefully making generous choices once in a body.

"lui4ea3","MaliseHaligree","2024-10-30 11:13:58 UTC","At first, there was a sense of weightlessness, but it was calming. Cerylia stirred, her eyes still closed. She groaned audibly and was surprised to realize she could finally breathe. Her body jerked as she remembered her fall into the cold waters of the lake and the iron it contained, eyes flying open as she sat up.


A sea of darkness surrounded Cerylia. Her lower half was in shallow water, lapping against a muddy shoreline that the rest of her had been laying in. She could feel the heaviness of her hair, caked in warm, wet earth. It smelled of detritus and greenery, like a spring garden. It was a beautiful scent, full of the promise of blossoms and new growth. She stood up, but her weakened knees buckled and she fell back into the dark mud.


“Salt and iron!” she cursed, clutching a handful of sludge. It oozed out from her fingers. Cerylia pushed back up, testing her weight on her legs. They held, so she pulled her hands from the muck and stood, surveying her surroundings.


Something was not right.


A giant tree loomed over her like a massive sentinel, boughs thicker than the hindquarters of the muscular wild horses that roamed the western plains. Roots sunk into the soft mud in small pillars. Small lights flickered in the leaves and branches: pastel shades of pinks and yellows, greens and blues, and even some white and purples. Cerylia looked closer, expecting them to be some kind of animal, but as one floated by, she realized that they were orbs of light and energy. She went to touch it but a vibrating tingle went through her fingers and she pulled her hand away.


She realized that the wispy lights were everywhere, floating around the enormous tree and the island that harbored it. They hovered over hazy gray waters that went on as far as she could see, reflected from underneath like colored stars.


“How did you get here?” a voice inquired from behind her. It was soft, feminine. Cerylia whirled around, her hand going to her hip but she remembered as she grasped empty space that she had let the lake take her weapon. She sighed heavily, facing the woman.


She was strikingly pretty, with wavy golden hair framing her thin face, but with sad eyes. Instead of a weapon, she carried a heavy iron lantern. Robes in a dusty rose color pooled around her. Cerylia wiped her muddied hand on her wet pants and surveyed the woman, who only stared at her curiously.


“You aren’t one of my usual wards.” Her violet eyes were unusually bright as they bored into Cerylia, and it felt like she was staring into her very core. The same eyes as the ones from her dream. Her heart skipped a beat. The woman squinted and her lips set into a small frown. “I am Shecaya. Why are you in the Hinterlands? Your mothers will not be happy,” she said, and Cerylia felt an entire mix of emotions wash over her as she realized who this woman was.


This was *the* Shecaya, courier of souls between her world and the world of Mwrre, the Hinter. She eyed the lantern, which currently was open and empty, but normally would house the souls of the departed until she carried them...here.


“Oh, no,” Cerylia breathed, looking out at the gray fog and the soft lights. Her heart began racing again as she remembered passing out as the lake dragged her to its bottom. “Am I dead?”


“No, that’s the curious thing.” Shecaya’s answer came quickly, and she stepped closer. “You are very much alive.”",""

Not really literature, but nonfiction - Randy Alcorn’s Heaven goes through every verse in the Bible about Heaven and answers questions like “Will we have pets?” “Will we have jobs?”

It follows this woman named Lilly, she died from cancer and ended up in the afterlife. She goes through universal judgement and finds out she was able to have a paradise and her paradise is the hobbit town from Lord of the rings. Every paradise, every different pantheon connects through the universal hallway. She grew up evangelical so she thought she wasn't worth having a paradise so she strolls down to hell finding that the gate demons are having a hard time with Karen's and Kevin's saying that they don't belong there, how they should be in heaven. Lilly ends up becoming friends with the gate demons and creates a hellp desk. Hell has 9 levels. Levels 1-2 are therapy levels, 1 being soft therapy and 2 being more intense therapy. Levels 3-5 are Karen's and Kevin's who have done bad in life but if they accept to grow as people they can work up the levels and have the potential to reincarnate, if not they stay in their levels. Levels 6-9 are where the more bad people go, 9 being the most awful and they just get tortured without the ability to go up levels and to reincarnate. There is also this pocket dimension called the void, anyone can go there to simply not exist at all. Hell is portrayed to be all about justice and healing.

"lujn41n","Banana_rammna","2024-10-30 16:29:10 UTC","I feel like it’s an urban legend but I remember the author extensively researched the afterlife with many near death experience victims and those that were momentarily deceased on what their experiences were like.","lugryde"

"luh2z8r","loganalltogether","2024-10-30 04:41:09 UTC","I so badly want a film version of this story.  I really loved the concept, and like you, appreciated the ""mundanity"" of Hell.  The psychological struggles of the main characters were very interesting, and I think could play out real nicely on film.

Also, the final segment would just be such a great set-piece to see.","lugsqt1"

"luhmv2a","Animal_Flossing","2024-10-30 08:12:10 UTC","That was also the first one I thought of, in spite of it not being from a book. The great thing about that setting is that it's really using the idea of an afterlife to do something interesting, not just as a setpiece or a vaguely defined carrot/stick to motivate the characters.","luh5yxm"

"luhyj1x","Smart-Lawfulness-921","2024-10-30 10:21:11 UTC","Yeah I didn't like Paradiso either. Gonna disagree with you on Purgatorio, that was fun. The dialog really reflected what purgatory must be like.","luh26q6"
"lugyp7x","Scat_fiend","2024-10-30 04:05:43 UTC","I got a rather different perception from that book. That poor girl was murdered and appears to be in purgatory. She watches the lives of her family (and killer) and is all alone and waiting for them to eventually join her. And when her grandmother does eventually die that doesn't even happen. Grandma is off having a great time elsewhere apparently. Please correct me because that didn't look nice at all.","lugrpuc"
"luijlvy","JJKILL","2024-10-30 13:02:18 UTC","One of my all time favourite books. And at like 100 pages a very easy read for a weekend. For such a short book it is an amazing image of how purgatory would feel like. I love it a lot, and since I've read it I think about it almost weekly.","luh8ggd"

I'm not one to remember ""images"" from books, but the whole ground-becomes-transparent thing is one that I *do* very distinctly remember. And if well-directed, I imagine the final segment would be one of those scenes that gets lodged into your very being. It's so evocative even when it's just words on paper.","luh2z8r"
