"lr0xe5f","Minecart_Rider","2024-10-09 00:52:00 UTC","As someone who has worked at both a city and a small town library, I am not at all surprised that that's a big difference. This stuff is all just personal experience and observations. 

Not even counting small communities that simply don't have libraries in them at all, small towns that do have libraries usually have very limited hours and tend to have employees that have very little training. While a city library usually employs people with some level of relevant education, not many people can afford to go to school to work at a library that is open 4-20 hours a week. A library that is open 12 hours a day every day is a lot more accessible that one that is only open from 10-2 on Wednesdays(not even exaggerating). 

The lack of training is also relevant. Small town librarians who are trying their best still don't have all the resources that a city has, and a lot of them are retirees with old fashioned attitudes who believe patrons who aren't checking out books shouldn't be allowed to use the washrooms, that children shouldn't be allowed to play video games on the public computers, or that books they don't approve of should be hidden away on shelves people won't notice them on. These are all real examples I have witnessed, along with racism that has made people feel unwelcome. 

The ""everyone knows everyone"" aspect also has impact for a few different reasons. People are a lot less comfortable checking out books on difficult topics like addiction or medical issues, or ""embarrassing"" books like smutty romances because they know the people who work there and fear judgement and gossip. 

Religious home school families are also super common in small town libraries. They have the most free time since they aren't on any solid schedule and are usually open to an excuse to get out of the house into an environment that can be educational. It is also usually the only free community space that is safe from bad weather. I'd be interested to see a comparison on if and how religious home school families in the city use the library compared to small towns since I rarely am aware of them in the city, but they are probably a lot less likely to bring it up in the more collectivist city than the small town where they can sit down and chat with you for half an hour lol.",""

My local library spent a million dollars building this automated system for returning books with conveyor belts that doesn't work half the time, I'm opposed to shit like that.

I generally avoid public bathrooms of all kinds because I find them kind of gross/sketchy.

I'm non-religious and mostly uneducated, which apparently is associated with less book-reading for other people.

One thing they may be thinking of though, is HOW people are using the services/spaces.

It is a huge gap in their research.

But if you visit a similar city library system in a Southern state it just doesn’t compare. They don’t get anywhere near the same funding and resources. If Northeastern & Mid-Atlantic libraries were funded the way Southern U.S. libraries are I doubt they would be utilized as much. It seems like it’s a bit of a chicken-egg situation: do areas with highly educated people value (and fund) libraries more or do well-funded libraries create people who value (and go on to attain) more education? I suspect it’s probably a bit of both.

The article is quick to say Republicans don’t like libraries and Democrats do and that Southern Americans don’t like libraries and Northern Americans do and that more religious Christian Americans don’t like libraries and other Americans do. But I think what they’ve really identified are the groups of people who are most likely to live in areas with shitty libraries. I don’t think it’s *that* crazy for someone to see their dilapidated local library with hardly any books or resources that appeal to them and think “what a waste of money”. Especially when their area is dealing with other major economic challenges. I think it’s selfish and short-sighted (like most Republican views) but I don’t think it’s inherently illogical. And I can’t help but wonder if they would feel differently if their local library service was on-par with, say, Boston or Pittsburgh (which, surprisingly, also has an incredible library system) or even Detroit which faced some serious funding challenges recently and voters overwhelmingly approved a property tax to keep its doors open.

Actually, no, or at least not entirely.  From the article:

>But then we found a much simpler explanation for the party gaps in library use. They shrink right up when we account for just one variable: the urban-rural divide. About 30 percent of city Republicans visited libraries in the past month vs. 35 percent of city Democrats, a difference that’s within the margin of error. For rural folks, the blue-red library gap was 16 percent vs. 9 percent.

>Democrats, packed into urban areas, may simply have access to more and better libraries. Rural libraries and bookmobiles are doing secular-saintly work out there with limited budgets. But Iowa’s South English Public Library and North Dakota’s Bowbells Public Library, which serve a few hundred people and measure their budgets in the single-digit thousands, simply can’t provide the exhaustive collection and endless and esoteric services you’ll find at the New York Public Library, the nation’s largest, which had $332 million to throw around in 2022.","lqxwtxc"

However, if I just look at the people I know who read a lot (poor to rich and all between), I do notice that the readers I know who delay gratification and/or do less impulse shopping generally are much more likely to use the library. True of rich and poor etc so I don't personally see a correlation between that and income in my own small sample but that could be because I know way more poor people than rich so my sample is already skewed in the other direction. But this seems to be the defining feature of people using libraries- again in my experience.

I can't see the article (paywall) so I don't know how great the correlation with income is, but if library usage is a feature of people who delay gratification in other aspects of their lives more generally then it's a pretty typical correlation with income that you see in other aspects of life. For example, people who plan meals and cook, people who don't buy things online as frequently, people who plan their budgets, people who keep their kids on a very organized schedule. You'll find these behaviors among people of all income levels, but they are skewed towards people of higher incomes because they have more stability in their lives. It's not really about time so much as time management and being more proactive / in control / future thinking than people who have less stability and are more likely to be in survival mode or managing a more chaotic or dynamic present. So you'd be more likely to make hitting the library at its hours a part of your lifestyle and of not buying a book on impulse when you happen to be near a bookstore or instantly online when you think of it. In the same way you'd already have your meals planned for the week and the habit formed to manage them so you're less likely to run through the drive through or order take out. 

I have no idea if this holds up since I can't see the article but it's something I've noticed.","lqzgrjk"

I don’t think some of the insights of this survey, like that people in rural areas underutilize libraries, would have shown up that way.

If I use Libby, I scroll through and find a book, and press borrow.

If I go to the library, I see other people in my community, maybe drop my kid off for story hour, see the cork board with flyers for activities or gatherings in the area, etc.  The library is a free, safe area away away from home (or lack of home).  Some libraries rent out various physical things not available through an app.

I'm not putting any sort of value judgement on it, it's just a clearly different thing.  I borrow all my library books through my ereader and generally only go to the actual library with my kid.","lqxlijv"

For example, I work in the Museum field and a virtual “visit” viewing the galleries online virtually is counted differently than an in-person one for grant writing etc. I didn’t know if it was a similar thing or not. 

In person visits can be counted differently to justify building maintenance costs, operating hours, etc. it’s not unreasonable to think that might be the case.","lqxlijv"

Others include ‘the govt isn’t paying for my hobbies’ and ‘they can afford phones so I shouldn’t have to pay for them to use the internet ‘.   He isn’t the only person that spouts this shit. There is a pervasive belief amongst a lot of people on the right that public services are inherently liberal and are being used to recruit people to the left. 

Well funded libraries are utilized by well educated people because well educated people are more able to relocate to places where a fantastic library isn’t seen as a bad thing.","lqy1luu"

"lr0s39t","Minecart_Rider","2024-10-09 00:13:17 UTC","Depending on the library, they usually have some way to get around this. If someone is housebound, most large libraries will have a system where either books can be delivered to them, or a caretaker can pick books up for them. Sometimes a library employee will even choose the variety of books for the person based on their taste if they don't have anything in mind.

If they are in a community living situation, there will often be a chunk of library books brought to the facility and regularly switched out for residents to borrow, but I'm not sure how the stats would be tracked for that.

This study does seem focused on people who are physically coming in, so I'm not sure if they've considered that.","lqy8m9r"

I mean we break out different formats for circulation, but we also do that with genres, though that's usually just for internal determinations about how to allocate budget, but the argument is using Libby counted as using a library resource, and I think that is a fundamentally different question that, more often than not, comes from a prejudiced view that digital books or audiobooks ""aren't real reading"". I do not mean to imply you feel this way, but if you look at any other subreddit you'll find people having that dumb argument ad nauseum. 

Using any library resource is using a library resource, it's a tautology, but it's fundamentally true. How certain things are broken down is immaterial to the fact that using Libby, which is funded using collection development dollars and has a person doing material selection (fuck you Hoopla), isn't fundamentally different than purchasing print materials, even if they are a billion times more expensive. 

I totally get the general public not understanding how the sausage gets made, but I don't think this is that, I think it's an optics problem, and a misunderstand of the services libraries provide.","lqyzv7m"

I use the online book borrowing services.  My 4 year old uses the physical book resources, the games, and toys. My 10 year old neighbor uses the library as a quiet study space.  Maybe people over 65 rarely go into a physical library. Is that because the locations are too far from where they live? Hard to access?

What you're doing is ranking what services you think are more vital, or core to library services, and that inherently undermines the mission of the library. They are all valid and good uses of the library. Don't let your nostalgia cloud your view of how libraries should operate. 


A Libby checkout is just as good as a physical one, maybe slightly better because you didn't need to drive to get it. But physical is good too, accessibility is key.


But also remember, it's not the library's job to create accessible transportation or affordable housing, though most would agree we should support those endevours.


I'm glad you support libraries. I do. But you don't have the perspective of how libraries operate. I'll pull an position of authority. I've been a librarian for almost 2 decades, serves on boards of national, state, and county library associates, have published in library journals, and have worked from page to associate director. 


I'm not entirely trying to pull rank, but I've dedicated 25 years to this field and might have a perspective you don't. ","lqxxdwz"

It's a service we provide, and while we might have to make choices how we provide services, I think it's important to keep in mind that it is a service. Ya know? I know I'm probably being overly nitpicky, but these types of distinctions make material differences on our funding so setting the record straight is.......like literally part of my job.
