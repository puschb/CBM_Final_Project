For one the tolerance and enlightenment has always been limited to !the work! if at all. Which this isn't about.

Authors can write about war all they please. They can even make ""external from the work"" statements about war in general all day.

What they can't do is publish their personal opinions on SPECIFIC events, by name, and particularly against the current mainstream opinion, without being lobbed in with one extremist group or other.

Then yes... That will cost you your livelihood.

Suppression of dissent also suppresses connections between people and communities in a time of organized abandonment, a time when we need each other even more.

How are those linked? The author has taken a number of separate issues and claimed (without explaining why) that they are linked.

Also, between a resurgent China and Russia invading Ukraine, I fail to see why the US should decrease its military budget. 

>For writers, censorship and suppression is also taking place within notable arts institutions. PEN America — which canceled its 2024 annual awards this spring after nearly half the nominees withdrew their books from consideration due to the organization’s response to Israel’s war on Gaza — is now asking publishers to confirm with authors that they want their books to be considered for the 2025 awards, ostensibly to avoid finalists again withdrawing in protest and to circumvent a writers’ boycott of the organization.

So it's censorship when there isn't a competition because of the choices of writers?

Why is that this article takes issue with anything but blind condemnation of Israel?

If this article believes what it claims, 

>In many of the attacks I received, the senders referenced my race in their threats, suggesting I should shut up or meet with physical violence. Yet I, too, have my own stake in speaking out against war and occupation. I was born in the U.S., in part because, like so many children of immigrants, of U.S. military presence in my ancestors’ home country — the Philippines, a former U.S. colony. My parents immigrated during a period of martial law, led by U.S.-supported dictator [Ferdinand Marcos](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/philippines/tl03.html), who [imprisoned and disappeared](https://cmfr-phil.org/in-context/for-the-record-in-context/martial-law-50-media-repression-then-and-now) thousands of journalists, writers and editors. Marcos’s son, now currently president, recently [expanded](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/marcos-says-new-military-bases-with-us-be-scattered-around-philippines-2023-03-22/) U.S. military access to Philippines bases.

This paragraph have two main issues. One, claims without evidence.

Two, she takes issue with the US having a military presence - because apparently Philippines shouldn't be allowed to want the US military in its country so it has protection from China.

This article is from a far-left source which contains a number of double standards, and as embodiment of antisemitic hypocrisy. The number of double standards amounts to antisemitism due to its blind condemnation of Israel and subsequent creation of a narrative which makes Hamas look good by remaining silent on its atrocities.","ltujekw"

"ltunpq7","MNDSMTH","2024-10-26 14:00:28 UTC","This. The bias in media is such a mind fuck. It's psychological warfare on a mass scale. It's made me such a cynic and jaded. It's hard to believe what's true. When I have to cross reference multiple sets of partisan media and try to filter out the bias and agendas, it makes it a chore to ""stay informed."" It makes me bristle when I read language designed to manipulate my understanding, rather than form my own conclusions.

For example I worked in a rough part of Chicago. Every time there was a ""mass shooting,"" the propaganda machines for each side would crank up to sway opinion for a couple weeks and then everyone would forget the 12 people killed.

The media and politicians would be the champions of the victims when it sells news or scores political points. No one cares that hundreds of people are murdered in that city every year. Gang initiation has some initiates murder someone to gain entry. My coworkers best friend was a victim of this. Got blown away at a stoplight. But 4 people shot at some event is the crisis.

I listened to the testimony of Mosab Hassan Yousef.  The son of the top Hamas leadership. I wish others would hear the story of his journey.","ltujekw"

For instance you dont insist or debate casually in the media or newspapers that the evidence shows that x group is say less intelligent. In other words, some notion of ""you better be entirely correct if you are going to be an asshole"". 

So i guess some form of restriction on what can be written was not unjustified if you look at history and I would even say something necessary for the sake of the truth.

If you don't do this then you're just going to be swimming in one side's propaganda in an environment where speaking against the mainstream side will get you criticized as you point out.

I don't do it anymore, but a decade ago I started following Al Jazeera English to get a better idea of the Palestinian point of view, and it was very enlightening. Yes they would ignore some stories completely that would make the Palestinians look bad. But there were plenty of atrocities and other bad things done by Israel and their government that I learned about that you won't ever hear a peep about in Western media because it makes Israel look bad, they're both guilty of not giving you the full picture of the atrocities happening there. There were other points of view on other topics not at all about Israel/Palestine I also got to hear from Al Jazeera English that I found quite interesting that you'd never hear in western media either.

I stopped following most news sources a number of years ago (since all that bad news just stresses me out, and is bad for my mental health), but by listening to both sides on Israel and Palestine I came to the conclusion that there's no good guys on either side, especially when it comes to the decision makers on both sides who don't want peace, and the people who are fighting and killing each other and leaving poor civilians on both sides to pick up the pieces.","ltuq1bi"

""Regarding the detention of Palestinians in Israeli military camps and detention facilities, the report found that thousands of child and adult detainees, many of whom were arbitrarily detained, have been subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence. Male detainees were subjected to rape, as well as attacks on their sexual and reproductive organs and forced to perform humiliating and strenuous acts while naked or stripped as a form of punishment or intimidation to extract information. The deaths of detainees as a result of abuse or neglect amount to the war crimes of wilful killing or murder and violations of the right to life.

And you equate this to institutionalized, industry-driven systematic suppression of dissent?  Being fired for speaking out against genocide, being blacklisted by the industry is not equivalent to mere negative sentiment or backlash in opinion amongst the general populace. The use of direct levers of power over livelihood to silence dissent is not the same as not being recieved well. 

It's funny because false-equivalency as a tactic has traditionally been used to sustain the genocide these authors are highlighting in the first place: that Israel and Palestine are something like 'equal combatants' in a 'war', and that therefore there's nothing to see here because 'war is hell'. In reality, over the past 80 years the 'civilized' west has been watching on TV the successful European invasion, maraudering and brutal eradication of a native populace (all of it richly funded from the beginning by the American taxpayer via the DoD, and so weilding terrifyingly advanced millitary supremacy) against that peoples' increasingly hapless attempts to resist their own genocide.

In any case - she wasn't cancelled. The organisers still wished her to perform her role. Instead, the people due to be on the panel made decisions not to appear on it. There was no panel to moderate.

>Koplik writes, ""We did not remove Elisa from the authors’ panel that she agreed to moderate (“Girls Coming of Age”). Indeed, we refused to remove her. As a result, one participant refused to participate, and another decided not to do so in support. A third wanted to avoid controversy. We never would consider removing Elisa, and we stood up to those who wanted to remove her. **We no longer had a panel to be moderated.** We fully support Elisa’s expression of outrage and disappointment.

This is completely different from an organisation using their power to silence people, which is what the OP's article is referring to. The organisation could have asked other people to appear on the panel and her moderation would have gone ahead as previously planned.

I agree. But I didn't understand why you would mention that she writes YA/fantasy if you didn't feel it was relevant to your point. Ender's Game is also YA (if not fantasy), yet I would certainly expect the person who wrote Ender's Game to have some pretty relevant thoughts about war in general, and the war in Gaza specifically (whether or not I agreed with those thoughts, I know OSC is kind of a weirdo).

>just because they are incredible *fantasy/YA writers*, doesn't mean they are in any way qualified to comment on a *real life war conflicts*

I guess I'd reiterate what I said before: YA authors can't be good unless they have something meaningful and insightful to say about adult topics. That does not mean their topic of choice needs to be WAR, it could be friendship or trust or political engagement, etc etc. So we can't expect all YA/fantasy authors to have cogent thoughts about war.

This is absolutely false for big enough businesses where they can diversify.  For example GE's income mainly comes from their financing department, aka interest on loans to people buying their appliances and financial investments.  The UC university's primary incomes are not from tuition, it is from endowments (again interests on investments) and patent rights and donations from big corporations and rich people;  This is why education just needs to be good enough to keep the game rolling.

Actually this is not true, many corporations prior to the 80s made heavy investment in research.  Some of the most famous labels are the AT&T' Bell Labs (created UNIX and network computing), Chevron's Material Research Lab (not sure the name, developed deep ocean oil exploration techs),  and Xerox PARC Laboratory, which invented the mouse controller amd GUI.  This trend of trading long term health for short term gain started in the late 80s or so I believe and it is related to the cut on the capital gains tax and the start of using stocks as CEO pay.  Thus, CEO's are incentivized to make short term gains to boost stock prices and doing buybacks.  

My point is institutions want to survive and grow.  I never say anything about long term or short term.  As long as an institution survives til next quarter with positive growth on paper, not necessarily real growth, then the CEO has done his/her job.  In addition, for a corporation the real institution it needs to protect and grow is not the business itself, it is the institutional investors behind the business that needs to be protected.  As long as the pockets of these people are growing, the company can restructure, rebrand, asset stripped, and effectively transform into another beast and it does not matter.","ltxbyoo"

Yes and no.  Sure people need to be brought to bear responsibility.  But the problem is they are just cogs.  It is like Nancy Pelosi said when she was questioned about her insider trading, ""We are all capitalists.""  Basically, she is just like the next person, whoever replaces her will do exactly the same thing.    

It is like trying to get rid of rats in a rat infested house.  It is not enough to simply trap the rats.  You need to fix the holes in the house, keep the inside and outside free of food scraps.  And if the house is unrepairable, you may need to just rebuild it from scratch.  

However, what we have is an ideological infestation of the mind.  Like Pope Francis said, ""the God of money.""  Money is everywhere, it is in our lives and in our thoughts.  We teach our kids to share when they are in kindergarten, but as soon as they enter elementary school, we teach them the religion of money, like private property, competition, and consumerism, which are the antithesis of sharing.  

As far as I can tell, the only cure is to replace the God of money with another God, just like how the God of money usurped the old God(s), be it Allah, Christian-Judeo God, or Buddha, or whatever.   I know it sounds weird but I think humans fundamentally cannot live properly together without ""religion.""  What I mean by religion can be as simple as having a set of moral values that one abides by and that somehow the society rewards you for exercising those moral values.  Basically a new social contract.","ltw9vur"

I think you're right in that this is a faith-based problem. Faith is a powerful and easily manipulated emotion, which is why it's played such a central role in the development of societies across history. The Enlightenment got us started in the right direction by questioning religious dogma with recorded observations, which in turn encouraged the development political ideologies that did not necessarily include religion as influence on their value structures.

These new ideologies eventually, through two world wars and the Cold War following it, coalesced into the big three that we're familiar with; capitalism/liberal democracy (they're always sorta lumped together like that; a la ""the Free World""), fascism and communism. Our species hasn't been able to leave this paradigm, even after we've reached the ostensible ""end of history"" (not kidding, this was actually a real debate being held by academics after the dissolution of the USSR). We have been raised in a world defined more by these three ideologies than any other faith-based worldviews, to the point where they are a viable alternative for people who feel the need to put faith in something that isn't metaphysical.

You're also correct that in order achieve the changes needed, there will need to be an honest-to-God social revolution. If one can't be achieved in the short term, it may already be too late for any solution other than throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There isn't a short-term solution for this problem. It will take **at least* two generations of people growing up while being taught that human deceny and well-being is, without exception, more important than driving GDP up a tenth of a percent every quarter. 

Personally, with the looming climate disaster, I don't think we have that many generations left ahead of us to reign this shit in. As climate change gets worse so will the political situation. Just like with every crisis since 9/11, it will be used as an excuse to curtail more personal freedoms and cede more regulatory authority to private enterprise. Private enterprise will continue to sow disharmony because it's good for profits and ratings, further preventing meaningful reform in the rapidly closing window of time we have left to us.

I wish I could see an alternative to a future that bleak. But not once in my life have I ever heard a conversation involving people of real influence discuss these things seriously. The best I've ever seen is ""we've set goals for ourselves to reach in 30/50 years,"" which is wildly inadequate. So I think we're proper fucked.","ltwk0to"
