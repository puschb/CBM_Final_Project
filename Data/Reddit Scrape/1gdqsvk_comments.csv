So a long time ago I read 'Mainspring' by Jay Lake. It had the most gobsmacking premise of any book I'd ever read. I left the first chapter utterly stunned.

I wanted to tell him that. I imagined myself running into him at a science fiction convention and saying, ""Damn! The AUDACITY!""

Meanwhile I'm working as a consultant. Consultants don't take sales calls because consultants can't buy anything: they don't work for the company. But one day my boss tells me to take a sales call: everybody else is busy. 

I go up to this meeting and the salesman starts his futile pitch. Then he says, ""Now, I'm not the technical guy. For that we have our technical consultant on the phone, Jay Lake.""

I'm stunned. 

""Jay... Lake?"" I ask.

""Yes, hi,"" says the phone. 

""Jay Lake... the author of 'Mainspring'?""

""Well, yes,"" says the phone. 

I turn to the sales guy. ""You're gonna have to excuse me a minute here,"" I tell him. 

Then I turn to the phone, ""DUDE! The opening chapter of 'Mainspring' was the most audacious thing I've ever read!!'

I honestly remember nothing else about that call. 

Afterwards I sprinted down the stairwell to my desk, eager to send Jay Lake a Facebook friend request, which was quickly accepted. I dove into his feed and discovered...

...he was dying of cancer.

He blogged the whole agonizing experience, struggling to work to maintain his medical coverage while fighting to finish his final books dedicated to his wife and daughter while fighting the hellish US insurance fraud system that would order him to take $15,000 medical tests and then refuse to cover the tests they'd ordered.

And then one day he was gone.

I'd never gotten to meet him. His posts about the health care system radicalized me forever. But somehow this weird, crazy world allowed me a chance to connect with him, to tell him how much I admired his work, and to learn from him. I'm grateful I had that opportunity.",""

The man knew how to take a big concept and package it into a well-paced, easy-to-digest ride without making it seem too silly or outrageous. And he had permeated other aspects of media, too. His works were adapted into blockbusters in addition to him developing original ideas for movies and TV.

The first few posthumous publications were fine, but I ultimately skipped the last release that was more-or-less entirely written by James Patterson. So it was kinda like my favorite author died twice - once when I knew he passed and all the original works were done, and once again after all the near-decent postumous content was exhausted and authors were now just writing things nearly wholesale and slapping his name on it under the pretense of ""based on his notes or an idea he jotted down once"".",""

I read The Fellowship the next year and the end of it tore me to pieces for years (the culmination of Frodo's story). I know they're not real but they felt like they were to me. Many years later the movie Avatar came out and I remember news broadcasts of people getting depressed because they wanted to live on that planet in the movie (there's a term for it, I forget).

Criminally unknown fantasy author.  He wrote a ten volume fantasy series in the 80s called The Chronicles of an Age of Darkness.  It was violent fantasy when fantasy fiction was nearly all family friendly.  The volumes in the series, as opposed to most series that tell an ongoing story, actually roughly cover the same period of time from different viewpoints.  And he even managed to include VR in one volume, and a non-traditionally attractive female character as the primary focus of another volume (which Hugh later said was the death-knell of the series, as it seems no one wanted to read fantasy with a *female* lead back then).

It was a favourite series as a teen.  Many years later in the age of the internet I searched him out to see what he went on to do.

He’d become an English teacher in Japan with an active blog.  And I rediscovered him just as he was diagnosed with brain cancer.  So for the next year I got to experience the ups-and-downs as he went through arduous cancer treatment, went into remission, got to experience firsthand what it was like to experience life brain-damaged, then finally the cancer came back, and it was a long slow decline until the final confirmation of his passing from a member of his family.

She said something like “when people show you who they are, believe them.” It sounds so basic and simple, but it helped give me perspective enough to distance myself from people who didn’t deserve that 25th chance and draw closer those that did.

"lu6d8hk","PPFirstSpeaker","2024-10-28 13:58:50 UTC","Robert Heinlein. Isaac Asimov. H. Beam Piper. And Terry Pratchett.

So many others. 

I knew some of those gone over, gone completely over. I got into science fiction conventions back in the 70's. Asimov and Heinlein were bad enough, but I found Piper's books through them. His story is so sad, and he created such beauty anyway. 

Little Fuzzy is still out there, somewhere. And Heinlein comforted me with his World is Myth philosophy. 

Too many times, authors are misconstrued and misunderstood. And sometimes, those who read their works just don't get it, so they malign the authors, twist their work until things break. 

_Starship Troopers,_ the book, is wonderful. The never-to-be-sufficiently-damned movie was not that story. It was what someone who had never even read the book wanted. They got the right to make the movie, but they only wanted the skin, so they could make some other piece of junk salable as a film. The things said about Heinlein over the twisted homunculus Verhoeven made of it shouldn't be said about a dog. 

Similarly, we will never get a proper film of Asimov's _I, Robot._ The movie was not about that book except in the most superficial ways. Instead, it was a totally different story called _Hardwired,_ that wore _I, Robot's_ skin.

And what they did to Alan E. Nourse was worse. They bought the rights to his book _The Bladerunner_ just so they could use it's name for _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep._ At least PKD's story was good, and the film so beloved.

We won't get any Doc Smith films, after what the anime called ""Lensman"" did to it, but at least the Green Lantern Corps got the message mostly right. But I still wish DC had simply asked Smith first. They did try to do better, and we got Arisia Rhab and Eddore of Tront to balance the scales a bit. 

I will miss the great creators who came before. But I curse those who ran their names through the dirt. Explaining that Author A was _not_ a fascist, that was just a movie treatment, or watching another author, who should have known better, take another author's work after they were gone, the copyrights expired, and ""create"" a ""re-imagined"" book of the same name, but not the same soul...I don't care _who_ he is, he didn't make it better, he did his best to kill it. Over politics. 

I'm sorry. I'm old and bitter. But it had to be said. We should treat those gone before better.",""

Robert Jordan loved his fans so much—he did so many interviews, commented on the book series fan page frequently (sometimes with fun stuff), and included fans in his novels occasionally. As he lay dying, he spent his time and effort making sure someone could finish the series.

 If any author deserved to celebrate the epic ending of a series with their readers, Robert Jordan did. And it breaks my heart that he didn’t.","lu4010b"
"lu5e2rm","Alspics","2024-10-28 09:24:29 UTC","At least Jordan knew the end was coming and had the story outlines complete. And he chose Sanderson to complete the series and if memory serves, he had discussions with him before his time came.

I know the middle books were slogs at times but I still loved the series and the world. I probably reread the series 5 or more times total by the time it ended and loved all the foreshadowing he built into the world. Sanderson did a great job finishing the series but it was never quite the same. And I have the utmost respect for RJ for knowing he was dying and dedicating a significant portion of his final months to ensuring his series gets finished. It shows such a love for his fans and the world he created.","lu4010b"

I feel like Brandon Sanderson did a pretty decent job of finishing the books and he was lucky to have Robert Jordan dictate a lot of the info he wanted to have in what was supposed to be the last book (but became 4).  At least we got an ending and not a cliffhanger!  Also, Robert's wife Harriet, did a lot of proofreading to make sure that the story flowed well.

He and I exchanged letters for years. He was always full of advice, wisdom, and guidance for me in a tumultuous time of my life. 

He’d come to my town for book signings and he would always make a point of saying hi to me before the event. I’d never felt so special for such a small kindness. 

The coolest thing he did was use my and my then boyfriend’s name in one of the Burke books as a mention. I gave my daughter Flood as a middle name to honor him and how much he meant to me. 

To this day, he is my hero and the single biggest influence of any writer I’ve read/met/admired. His passing left me gutted. I had just talked with him on Facebook a couple weeks prior and I was just gobsmacked. It was like losing a father.

An entire year passed before I read a book again. I reached out to Christopher directly to express my condolences, re-read an email I had received from her, and several direct messages. They somehow comforted me, and yet amplified my feelings of being eternally separated from her. I still randomly read passages... 

'Violin', 'The Wolf Gift', 'The Witching Hour', 'Pandora', 'Interview with the Vampire'; it sounds strange (and probably very ignorant) but I feel her presence the most in those novels. I just think, ""I hope you're at peace now. Resting with them, down among the bones.""

I also thought his show at the time demonstrated him to be crass and dismissive of other cultures that he was visiting. Over time, he started to get a lot better, though.

The puzzling thing to me is that the values demonstrated in the book are the opposite of JkRs apparent views. It makes no sense. 

I do personally think it is ok to enjoy art and not support the artist personally (as long as you aren’t still paying them or promoting their platform). I know some people would filet me for saying that, but I think we unknowingly enjoy a ton of books are music and art from total jerks, and most historical work has problematic creators.

Adams and Carwardine (who's both a zoologist and a photographer) went to Madagascar to find lemurs, and did a radio special about it for the BBC. A few years later, together they turned it into a series of several specials, then a book, then an audiobook. 

Many years later (2009) after Adams death, Carwardine partnered with Stephen Fry to do a TV series by the same name, which included updates on many of the species visited in the original radio series. 

If you've ever seen a video clip of Stephen Fry standing in the jungle with a large bird humping his cameraman's head, as he narrates that ""You are being shagged by a rare parrot,"" that's from the TV series.","lu9syb7"

State of fear seemed interesting at the time but looking back it was straight up absurd sci Fi level nonsense with pretty people that were patronizingly condescending running away from nerds with fucking weather weapons. The worst part is how hard he defended it and he defended it to his death.

Next was just odd. A bunch of weird vignettes that never meshed and the underlying grudges held were off putting.  

But I was mainly referring to state of fear which is beyond garbage and in my opinion tarnished his entire career.","lu48i8m"

Also, in that span from 2010-2024, between the 5 Stormlight Archive books, he also published 32 other novels, 20 short stories, 4 graphic novels, 2 audiobooks, 1 children’s book, *and* the last 2 Wheel of Time novels.

Jordan's biggest problem was how clearly and how detailed he saw the story.  It made him his own worst enemy. And it made his stories so much better and the world was so much more complete.  We lived there every page.

New Spring was intended to be the first of at least three outrigger novels amongst other writing projects.  That was direct from Jordan's mouth.

And, to be clear, if he hadn't passed I would have been right out in front to read every single novel, loving every single page.  I mourn the lost novels, even now.","lu4iih4"
