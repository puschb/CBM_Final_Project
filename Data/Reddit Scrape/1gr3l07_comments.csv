I picked it up again last Wednesday looking for a specific passage and the edition I now own was published in 2017 and included a new introduction by Atwood. She discusses how she intentionally did not make up any of the political/social scenarios in the books, everything has happened at one point in time in history.

She chose religion as the authoritarian figure, but it could've been anything else. Too often, she just sits back and waits for life to happen. 

We put so much trust in our institution and on principle (ex.: the rule of law) that we do not realize that they are principles and they are only respected if people adhere to them.

Unfortunately, as Christian, we are raised to always see the good in people, to constantly forgive and forget. I don't think it's a bad thing on the day to day, but when it comes to systematic oppression, it can become really dangerous because we might excuse unacceptable behavior (i.e.: Trump) in the name of the greater good.

I mean in fairness to the Catholic Church - I know, where's the fun in that - this is the most negative take you could possibly have to express that:  
\\- prior to the invention of the printing press, bibles were insanely expensive to produce and only the wealthy could afford them. Expensive things then - like now - were kept under lock and key to prevent theft. 

\\- middle age literacy was low. Very few people actually could read, so only specific people - e.g., literate people - could read the Bible. In many communities, the only literate person was the Catholic priest. 

\\- Latin was the language of scholarship after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and it was the closest thing to a lingua franca for Europe.

I no longer beleive so.  It isn't that I think it is happening or even that it might happen.   But I can see *how* it could happen.  It is no longer far fetched.


I don't know if that is because things have changed over the last 30 years, or because I better understand the nature of religion in the US.  Probably a bit of both.  In mostly secular England, the religion I knew was mostly laughable ""more tea, vicar?"".  The religious conflict we knew was sectarian violence with a long complex political history in Northern Ireland.  Not really Christian against non beleiver nor Christian oppression of their own.  Though that was clearly blindness given scandals and revelations since.  As for US religion, most of the media we consumed was secular or contained quaint tradition.  We knew of televangelists but treated them as a bad joke and assumed that they were outliers not representative of anything bigger.

No, it wasn't. Christian nationalism isn't merely Christianity being an enforced norm, and the Wikipedia definition you use here is inadequate.


Nationalism is an important part of the phrase, and nationalism did not exist in the Middle Ages. Nationalism requires an identity on the national level, and nations in the sense used here did not exist then.


We see nationalism developing around the 1700s, I believe, and a big surge of it leading up to (and leading to) WW2. It's important to understand that nationalism can be applied to a few different kinds of movements, including the development of a national identity (thus its rise during a time of many independence movements).


*Christian* nationalism refers to the intertwining of Christianity with a national identity. It sometimes, but not always, involves a specific desire to establish Christianity as a part of government in an explicit way, while certainly involving the imposing of Christian norms on a national level.",""

(Another piece of propaganda from this is the idea that people believed the world was flat, which was apparently invented in an early 19th century anti-Catholic story book.) In the middle ages, universities were open institutions, though in later periods poorer men could less easily access them. There was massive intellectual ferment and attempts to control this were not very successful. The Church was suspicious of Aristotle, whose writings (previously poorly known) had been recovered via the Arabs, and tried to limit it. The University of Paris however openly prescribed the entire works as reading. 

A study of a particular village whose records happened to survive (Duffy, on Morebath) found that it had parallel institutions, with elected offices, for men and women. Women were occasionally elected to the most important men's office (warden).

"lx3i8ad","Draedre","2024-11-14 15:15:17 UTC","I think you may be confusing the concept ""nation"" with ""nation state"". 

Nations have been around for eons. I'm pretty sure that certain peoples in the (ancient) past were definitely, unequivocally nationalistic in their world views. Nations, in this sense, can be built around religions, powerful leaders, language groups, ethnicities--usually some mix of all of these. And such people, united by shared identities, have been variously raping and butchering and burning in the name of their ""group"" for as long as we have records of people being people.

You're right that ""nation states"" are relatively new on the world scene. I'm also pretty sure, though, that most political scientists would credit them with actually *reducing* strife overall rather than fanning it. It's a mixed bag. The worst exceptions are places where ""nations"" have been split up by national borders (i.e, by a modern nation state). Think ethnic kurds, for example, split among modern Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey.

Of course, powerful national identities can also be forged inside of actual nation states (your example of Germany/WW2 fits here), but compared to the ethno/linguistic/religious identities that used to rule much of the governed world (with often brutal consequences for those who were ""other""), most modern nation states are purring kittens.","lx2z8o0"

Before the 19th century, science was accepted as a way to explain how God runs the universe. This is why individual scientists could be persecuted for doing ""bad science"", not based on how correct or incorrect they were, but on the theological implications. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it became increasingly clear that science was operating without reference to God, and therefore essentially showing that the natural world was not being run by God. The poster child for this was *The Origin of Species*, which argued that species don't fit ""perfectly"" into their environment because of God's plan, but just because competition selects the individuals that fit best in the environment.

The problem with fundamentalism is that, by believing that everything in your text is literally true and unquestionable, then any facts that contradict that text attack your faith. It becomes all one piece. If, instead, you were to say that your text is a literary interpretation meant to teach us moral truths or social truths or something, written the way it was because of the social situation of the time, then the truth or falsity of individual facts is irrelevant.

Also **Matthew 7:21-23;** “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’.

There are pieces that don’t make sense for the modern world, but when taken into consideration the time and place it was written, it is in fact incredibly progressive for women’s rights, animal rights, and human rights. 

In a world where rulers were the descendants of deities, the idea that escaped slaves were chosen to uphold a covenant between the creation of all being and mankind was ludicrous. More so when it’s added that all of mankind, not just the leaders of it, were created from and part of said creator (dust and breath, which is what Adam and Eve translates to in Hebrew). 

Kosher laws have it so it is not permissible to kill a baby animal in front of its mother or visa versa. You can not cook it in its mother’s milk. This is to emphasize kindness. You have to eat but do not do things that must be done in a cruel way. This was written thousands of years ago and the tradition is older than the writing. 

For the slavery laws it is written if there is only one bed to give the bed to your slave and sleep on the floor. Is slavery bad? Yes. But look at the slavery laws surrounding them. 

There are no bastards. Orphans and widows are to be cared for. Check out medieval England and tell me Judaism 1000 years before Christianity became a big hit there wasn’t more progressive. 

Don’t get me wrong. It has its flaws. But by only looking at the flaws, many of which are translated poorly and looked through a Christian lens, you are missing a lot of rich history.","lx2ypfd"

I didn't say they live their lives *only* to fulfill them. But they certainly are something that Christians generally consider to be an important aspect of their religion.

> Christian values can be summarised into loving God and loving people.

So, loving an authoritarian leader figure and loving people. One of those is how you get the handmaid's tale, the other is something that has nothing to do with Christianity, other than Christians taking credit for people being nice, as people tend to be, Christians or not, hence why it is offensive to call it a Christian value.

> That's why I don't see Christian nationalism as Christianity. Christian nationalism is an ideology and a way to gain power but Christianity is not. 

Yes, Christianity absolutely is, too. Even the idea of teaching people that they are nice people because they are Christians, and by extension non-Christians are less likely to be nice people, is already a manipulative power move. Also, that is the basis that Christian nationalism builds on.

Also, what would even be your counter argument when someone claims that, say, misogyny as you find it in Christian nationalism is something that they have faith that god wants?","lx72opi"

*I made a rule for myself: I would not include anything that human beings had not already done in some other place or time, or for which the technology did not already exist. I did not wish to be accused of dark, twisted inventions, or of misrepresenting the human potential for deplorable behavior. The group-activated hangings, the tearing apart of human beings, the clothing specific to castes and classes, the forced childbearing and the appropriation of the results, the children stolen by regimes and placed for upbringing with high-ranking officials, the forbidding of literacy, the denial of property rights—**all had precedents, and many of these were to be found, not in other cultures and religions, but within Western society, and within the “Christian” tradition itself.** (I enclose “Christian” in quotation marks, since I believe that much of the Church’s behavior and doctrine during its two-millennia-long existence as a social and political organization would have been abhorrent to the person after whom it is named.)*

I've read on the true Scotsman fallacy you mentioned and I understand where you're coming from, but it's not because I'm trying to prove a point but it's because I just hedge a lot in my speaking. The Ten Commandments are not the basis of Christianity but of Judaism. 

A value is something you live your life to fulfill or something that governs your way of thinking or way of life. So even if the Ten Commandments are important in our religion, they are not what our religion is based on. Otherwise our religion will not be different from Judaism. I'm sorry if the Christians in your life or even the Christians in America are not loving. (I'm slowly starting to realize how American Christians are disliked) However, I'm not American, I've lived and travelled in different places and have experienced different cultures and Christians are the people who have shown the most love. 

Niceness is not equal to love. Just because someone is nice is not because they're loving. And no, we don't see others as less loving or less kind compared to us. Misogyny is not what God wants. I'm a feminist and believe in women's rights being human rights and from my extensive reading of the Bible, women are portrayed as being important and indispensable members of society even beyond procreation. I know people like to quote certain verses or scriptures to try to prove that Christianity is misogynistic but when you study theology and hermaneutics, to truly understand the context of certain verses, you realize how women are appreciated in the Bible. ","lx7ajc2"

Say what you will about that group, but they're a lot more honest about the negative stuff in the bible and less inclined to pretend it's not there or doesn't exist. In my opinion it makes them shittier people, but more theologically honest about what their religion truly says. The Bible is not a guide for morality, but authoritarian power structures with some feel good stuff spiced in to make it palatable. It's a tough pill to swallow for those of us raised to only see the good stuff and told that the rest is just ""taken out of context"". 

To answer your question, look to the letters of Paul (Saint Paul, for all the Catholics). Here's a few:

""*A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing — if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. (1 Timothy 2:11–15)*""

""*As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they want to enquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church. (1 Corinthians 14:33–35)*""

""*Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Saviour. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. (Ephesians 5:22–24)*""

Peter had his moments too:

""*…and treat them with respect as the weaker partner… (1 Peter 3:7)*""

  
Now you can choose to look at Peter, who in Christian mythology was a contemporary of Jesus, and say, hey, that's positive, isn't it? Especially for the time? Women may be physically less strong than men on average, but they should still be treated with respect... that's what it says, right? Well, maybe. But as Christians say, context is key. The problem becomes, how is ""respect"" defined in the bible and how is it practiced by Christians? How is ""weaker"" defined? The answer is, see Paul above. It's defined as subjugation and oppression, as lesser status, as lesser value, as having less right to opinions, as holding more blame, as existing as objects of male desire and temptation (victim blaming) and, at the heart of it all, as being lesser humans who it is appropriate to control. That's what the new testament means by ""weaker"" and ""respect"". Christians do not say this part aloud, but when we look at a lot of their actions, it shows through in subtle ways- so subtle most of *them* don't actually see it. They don't *mean* to be sexist, but the failure to challenge their subconscious biases perpetuated throughout Christian cultural subgroups results in some very devastating practices. The impact is more relevant here than their intentions.

Apologists will claim that Jesus respected women more than the people around him at the time. Perhaps. I suggest that's still not good enough. Beating someone to near death may be better than murdering them outright, but it's still far from good. When Jesus said that he came to fulfill the law of the Old Testament and not rewrite it, he effectively endorsed the misogyny, genocide, rape, and infanticides committed by Yahweh, the Old Testament god. In that manner, it is theologically unsound to fail to attribute god the father's treatment of women to his son, who is the extension of his holy personhood in Christian theology. When Paul created Christianity some decades after Jesus's death based on stories of the man he never met, he did not create a religion of peace and equality, no matter how much we *want* to believe it.

I appreciate you asking questions. Unfortunately when I had a lot of similar questions, I didn't really have a good place to ask them. I have little interest in changing your mind, just sharing my own thoughts since you asked for them. We're all better for these discussions taking place.","lx3cr7u"

"lx7okye","mindful_subconscious","2024-11-15 04:43:23 UTC","I asked this question to Claude (the better version of ChatGPT, IMO): 

The doctor’s claim about male infertility is actually one of the novel’s significant subversive elements. In Gilead’s official doctrine, female infertility is blamed for the reproduction crisis, and it’s considered heretical to suggest that men could be sterile. This makes the doctor’s statement particularly significant.

The text provides several hints that male infertility may indeed be widespread:

1. Historical context: The novel mentions environmental pollution and STDs as factors affecting fertility before Gilead

2. The high failure rate of Handmaids to conceive, despite being tested for fertility

3. Serena Joy’s suggestion to Offred that she try conceiving with another man (Nick), implying she suspects the Commander’s infertility

However, you raise an interesting point about the doctor’s motivations. His offer is presented in a predatory way - he holds power over the Handmaids and uses their desperate situation to make sexual advances. The scene demonstrates how even within Gilead’s supposedly rigid system, those with power can exploit others while claiming to “help.”

The ambiguity about whether he’s telling the truth about male infertility adds another layer to the scene. Is he manipulating Offred with a truth that Gilead suppresses? Or is he using this forbidden topic as a tool of coercion?

I believe Atwood intentionally leaves this open to interpretation, as it serves multiple thematic purposes: highlighting the hypocrisy of Gilead’s gender politics, demonstrating how truth becomes malleable under totalitarianism, and showing how power can be abused within supposedly protective systems.","lx7k161"
