If I'm going to picture actual 10 year old me back when these books were coming out \\[I actually got into Harry Potter around the time Chamber of Secrets came out, but whatever\\]

* Philosopher's Stone: Some Greek smart dude has a stone. Maybe the crazy kid on the front cover leads me to believe this has to do with Greek Mythology.
* Sorcerer's Stone: Sorcerer's Apprentice - I know that Sorcerer = Magic. So some magician has a stone. Not sure what the stone does, maybe it's a magic stone. . .but I know the book is about magic.

The title of a book is important to catch the eye of a potential reader, especially in a Pre-Social Media era where the internet was a Wild Wild West that not everyone was using yet.

Going back to unintelligible words. . .The title ""The Gorgflux in the Camtpstein"" is meaningless to me as a potential reader. . .Even if the book itself explains both terms within the first chapter. . .Hell, even if they're both explained on the inside of the dust cover.","lqzslmy"

"lr0fywb","lookmeat","2024-10-08 22:47:37 UTC","Full metal alchemist didn't have the term on their title, unlike the Harry Potter book. 

Imagine that FMA was instead called ""Edward Eric: Government Bureaucrat"", I mean it's accurate, kind of, he really doesn't end up doing the things you'd expect a bureaucrat to do, but hey close enough!

Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone has nothing to do with alchemy, and alchemy never matters more than a random reference thrown around. The titular Philosopher's Stone is just a Mcguffin that alludes to things that are never really part of the world and ultimately is probably the least meaningful or important artifact to make it to the title in the whole series. It's traditionally understood abilities don't matter, instead it's this new ability (to create a body) and many readers, adults assumed that it was Voldemort seeking to get immortality (one of the traditional things that the stone gives) but it turns out it wasn't needed as Voldemort already had achieved this. At that point: why didn't Voldemort steal it before to get a second immortality on top of the horcruxes?

So actually I think it was a smart move that makes it a better story to change the name of the Mcguffin from something it isn't in the story (and never does anything like that in the story) to something random and arbitrary that the author can make do whatever they want and not worry about people assuming it has other powers that never are used or mentioned. It was, honestly, a bad subtitle, not because people wouldn't get it, but because getting it would be detrimental to the story and what it wants to do with the titular object.","lqzww8d"

In North America, alchemy is associated with the the study of the thing, and not the individual studying it. The equivalent to alchemy as an individual is sorcerer.

"lr1jrrj","Llian_Winter","2024-10-09 03:41:58 UTC","The problem was 1. The Internet then was less than it is now. You couldn't carry it everywhere and it didn't contain all knowledge. 2. They weren't readers yet. It was the first book and the series wasn't yet a cultural phenomenon. The point of a cover and title is to draw in new readers. The average American 10 year old who doesn't know what a philosopher's stone is will take one look at the title. See the word Philosopher. Think ""pass"" and move on. Even today with everyone carrying the Internet in their pocket, most people are not going to look up the title to a random book they saw in the book store. Especially if they recognize the word philosophy and aren't interested.","lr014bn"

"lr0ilwi","clauclauclaudia","2024-10-08 23:05:47 UTC","Yeah. ""Natural philosophy"" is what gentleman scientists a couple centuries ago studied. And in Isaac Newton's time, there was no distinction between alchemy and chemistry. In the middle ages, astrology and astronomy were the same thing.

But in modern connotation those words are very distinct--certainly in US usage. Our entire country was founded after the Enlightenment. I think there may be a bit more cultural awareness of how those ideas used to overlap in the UK than in the US, but I'm pretty sure that in modern usage they're distinct over there too.

It's easy to say now, with the enormous phenomenon that Harry Potter became, ""Oh, why not just use the proper, original title?"" but when Scholastic was publishing the first book, that was not something that they could take for granted. Philosopher -> Sorcerer always annoyed me, but I was an adult Anglophile who caught up with the series around the time the third book came out and had already heard of the alchemical philosopher's stone. I was not the target audience, and I was not buying book 1 based on the title and cover.","lqzwgu9"

It's not ""dumbing down"" to change the word to ""flashlight"" when localizing for an American audience, especially children living in the days before social media blew up.","lqzx636"
