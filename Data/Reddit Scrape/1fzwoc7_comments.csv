"lr4ezj1","dyson_hairdryer","2024-10-09 17:33:42 UTC","I'm the exact opposite. If the prose is bad I'm immediately DNFing the book. If its good prose but the story sucks I'll finish it and hate on it afterwards. I physically cannot force myself to read bad writing no matter how interesting the story or plot is to me. For example, God's and Monsters series by Amber Nicole. I read the first two books and the first one I enjoyed but I hated the second because of how the plot just seemed thrown together. The writing was pretty good (although very repetitive at times) and I still finished it even though it was a 600+ page book. And then I gave it a bad review.",""

"lr4dp3v","etchlings","2024-10-09 17:26:56 UTC","It… depends. I get infuriated trying to muscle through truly baaaaad prose. It’s neither the brevity nor verbosity of the language either, but how it’s hung together. That said, I lean away from super spare prose, as it fails to provide enough emotive development of either setting or character. For me. 

If the writing quality is high, I may ignore some plot holes or cliches or guessable mysteries. But I’ll be kinda bored and just absorb some of the language in that case. I find a lot of young-aimed fiction (YA, MG) tends toward this end of the spectrum. No matter how well the author crafts a paragraph, if the plots are simple or predictable, and the characters foolish cartoons of angst that don’t ever learn better, I’m uninterested. Also at fault here are when “literary” authors try to take on genre fiction with lack of respect for the form or interest in understanding what stories have influenced it in the past. They can real quick hit cliche nonsense, pointless plot elements, and retreads of things no matter how well they write a book about The Normal Man Who Was Sad. 

I’ve DNF both types of book, over the years.",""

"lr4h3dl","thetrolltoller","2024-10-09 17:44:53 UTC","I have kind of a zero tolerance for bad prose. Part of it is because I’m trying to learn and improve as a writer so I like to read books that I can learn from. I like to read authors that make me go “holy crap I want to write like that someday.” I could power through it as a kid but as an adult I can’t. I also just think there is no excuse for any top-selling traditionally published book to be poorly and carelessly written. Yet so many of them are. 

I think too there’s a certain point where the poorly written thing starts to become subjective. To me, poorly written means uninspired, stylistically confused, grammatically careless (I don’t mind some deliberate rule breaking), seems unedited—stuff that makes me feel like the author doesn’t give a shit. There’s a lot of stuff that I think is well written that just isn’t my thing and I don’t really care to read it. I feel like I have to respect a book in order to get through it, and if the author doesn’t seem to respect their own work enough to put that effort in, why should I give a shit about it?

I can deal with a weak overall story if there are great characters + prose and I can deal with weak characters if the story + prose are solid, but at the end of the day I just need something beyond the prose to keep the pages turning. But terrible prose is an instant turn off for me whereas I’m more likely to give a book with a weak story + nice prose a chance. I usually download a sample chapter on my kindle app or read the first few pages in store to sort of quality check the prose.",""

I don't need it to be beautiful but I do need it to be unintrusive, because that's the mechanism by which I'm consuming everything else the book has to offer.

I enjoyed reading it even though I had no idea what was happening. The best thing is when the writing sucks you into a story that isn’t necessarily bad, but that you might have had no interest in otherwise! Like why The Stand might appeal to people who don’t read horror, or Lonesome Dove to people who aren’t into Westerns.

Bad prose, good story, no, though maybe it depends on how bad it is, or in what way it’s bad. That’s why I don’t read a lot of sci fi or fantasy. The wooden, overly explanatory, overly expository prose leaves me cold. Ditto for most genre fiction like mysteries and romance. They just don’t pull me in because of the way they’re written.",""
"lr4ybb5","TTurt","2024-10-09 19:17:07 UTC","I will read just about anything as long as it isn't *boring.* Bad prose makes for funny stories to tell later to my friends and family who like talking about books but don't want to read them all the way through just for a gag, and terrible writing / storytelling also makes for great out of context ""describe this story badly, but in a way that is also literally true"" jokes.

Pretty much the only thing I *won't* read is explicitly political thrillers. Typically these are pretty much always right wing by nature (Trigger Warning, State of Fear, etc.), I actually don't know if an equivalent genre of extreme left wing propaganda thrillers even exists in the first place (Jennifer Government is the only one I've ever read, but it was also more of a dark comedy / satire than a legitimate attempt at serious propaganda on par with something like Trigger Warning). But if it does, I've never seen it or read it, and don't really have much interest in doing so. 

Political thrillers are boring because if you already know the position they're trying to promote, you can already predict pretty much everything that happens in the book, because it's never EVER subtle. So it's a game of just waiting for the thing we all know is gonna happen to happen - I still remember in State of Fear, the way the male protagonist's female love interest literally had entire internal monologues about how much more manly / chadly / masculine / attractive he became, just because he changed his views on global warming lol. Or the time when their car was tossed into a river and about to go over a waterfall, but *thank God for pollution,* someone had polluted the river so the flow was blocked up and they were able to escape to safety! It was comical, I would have assumed it was a comedy if not for the totally unironic author's note at the end.",""

As for the latter, I've been reading Dionysius of Halicarnassus recently, and while those never-ending conflicts between patricians and the common people can be quite tedious and repetitive, I still find myself enjoying reading aloud the speeches he puts in the mouths of various characters.

This is so true. I read Left Behind as a teenager. I didn't think it was good, but to my recollection it's because I thought the story that unfolded was cheesy, not exciting like I wanted it to be. 

I discovered this blog recently that analyzes the whole book and talks about what's wrong with it. It includes many excerpts from the book and holy hell is the writing terrible. Forget the story even, the sentences are godawful.

I was just talking about the book The Prestige in another thread. The movie is way better than the book. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when >!Hugh Jackman’s character gets betrayed by his double because he doesn’t listen to his mentor and his pride won’t let him close his show early.!< in the book, >!his double demands more money so he just fired him and retires the trick.!< Is it sensible?

If youre ever looking for a contemporary sci fi / sci fantasy with great prose, i cannot recommend the Sun Eater series enough.

Prose conveys tone, emotion, atmosphere, etc. It's what separates reading a novel from just reading a summary of the plot. I don't know why you think the plot and prose are at odds, they are the literal two things that come together to form the novel you're reading. ","lrdwskl"
