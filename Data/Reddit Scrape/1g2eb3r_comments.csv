The first thig you'll notice about Robert's is that there is a Boeing 727 nosecone attached to the building when you pull into the modest parking lot.  When you step inside, you'll be treated with a maze of books with little room to pass others in it's cramped corridors.  There are books stuffed into every nook and cranny and piles of them on the floor in every aisle(don't forget to check those).

It doesn't change the underlying economics. The only reason to pay for content is to get more of it.
Absolute best case when you buy used is that the one selling it buys ""a"" book with the money.  Unlikely one that YOU would want to support.

So you are out money, you didn't achieve anything economic relevant, and you didn't support the author.
To me that is a lose lose lose kind of situation.
And it is optional. If I already don't want to support the author (yet), I can either try a library, or ...

If I can't afford all the books by an author I want to read, I could buy half their books. Instead of 2 used which helps them zero.
Why pay at all, if you don't want to pay the right person. I mean if it is about saving money (that you might not have, I am not being dismissive of that, at all), free is less than used.

It's just different from tech or clothes or whatever one can buy second hand, where there is neither an option to get ""a"" thing without paying, the value is in the object instead of the idea, and there is actually a giant issue with either complicated waste and/or complicated production.","lrsyvoa"

You think people should keep all of their books forever and only lend them out? What about the books they didn't like? What about when they die? Do you think all used books should just be free and never have a price tag?

You seem to care a lot about the author getting paid, but they get paid the first time. There is a secondary market for books just like there is a secondary market for clothes and almost any used item. Do you feel the same way about music? Movies?

What if the author is dead?

That is not an issue I have. I feel like you skipped WHY it isn't. It was rather core.

>What about when they die?  

Same thing as above. That's a problem very specifically already solved.

>Do you think all used books should just be free and never have a price tag?

How do you get there? That would be directly contradictory to the point about the need to support artists? (both morally AND from an egotistical pov)

>You seem to care a lot about the author getting paid, but they get paid the first time

I think you need to redo the math on that. If you don't see the underlying issue, I don't know what to tell you.
And again, why pay anything if ""doesn't matter who did or did not buy it"". In that case you can just go ""well, someone bought it, I am sure"" even when pirating.

>What if the author is dead?

You don't need to ask the same thing twice. See above.

>What if I hate an author and I'm happy they don't get money when I sell their used books?

Why do you even HAVE a copy in that case? Also: redundant with ""what if I don't like it"" above.

> Do you feel the same way about music? Movies?

Generally speaking, yes. Practically speaking: I listen to DJ-sets a lot that where on the radio that I DO pay for. And for movies/shows, that gets a LOT more complicated because of the amount of middlemen and corporate decisions. Which sadly HAVE to figure into decisions of direct support.
But yes, I don't buy those used either.

To me there is ONE reason to buy used.
Author dead, AND I need a hardcopy that can't just vanish because someone purged it from the web, AND I can't get a proper copy because they are out of print AND I can't find it in a proper quality.

So ""as an absolute last resort"". And I won't sell that either, because that would defeat the point.","lrta5wf"

To me used media either direction doesn't solve anything. It at best mitigates part of a set of problems that can be avoided fully in the first place, while giving the illusion to not create others, which can also be avoided fully in the same way.

That's the modern luxury. You can defer paying for media up until AFTER you are sure you want to pay for it, or not. It's not a ""buying the cat in a bag"" type of situation.","lrtcy9n"
