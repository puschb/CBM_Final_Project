He’s still a child in an environment where racism is so normalised that he doesn’t understand the gravity of it yet.

That said, I do think Twain is quite bad at endings! He doesn’t know how to end a book, a lot of them just stop, no denouement. It will be full blown action and then he’ll tack on one sentence like “and then they all went home”. Tom Sawyer Abroad is the best example but I remember Connecticut Yankee having an abrupt ending as well.",""

I adore the book itself (and yes, I love the heroine), but the ending... All we get is a few pages of summary instead of the actual plot and character development. It's like she was so tired of the book that she decided to end it right then and there instead of writing a proper conclusion.",""
"luiu1bn","GraniteGeekNH","2024-10-30 14:01:19 UTC","Endings are the hardest part of fiction, IMHO. That's why genre fiction is so popular: the ending is set in advance (murdered is uncovered, couple gets together) so the author can concentrate on characters, setting, etc.

Having said that, the ending of Huck Finn has long been criticized as being out of tune with one of the great American novels.",""
"lui4xkj","TOONstones","2024-10-30 11:18:28 UTC","Yeah, I think that Tom is supposed to have a privileged, immature attitude about slavery. At the beginning of the story, Tom is supposed to be ""above"" Huck. He's respectable, educated, a boy to be admired. He might represent the Northern attitude towards slavery - against it in principle, but also blissfully unaffected by it. By the time the story ends, Huck's meanness and real-world experiences have actually made him mature past Tom. He's a new attitude in America who has begun to understand how painfully evil slavery is and has a personal stake in ending it.

That said, and to answer your question, I think that Stephen King is the master of telling a good story with a horrible ending. Some of his short stories are good, but his novels... I'm almost always disappointed with the endings. 'The Stand' was a brilliant character-driven novel, but the ending was anticlimactic. 'The Shining' was intriguing and horrifying, but the ending was absurd. 'Hearts in Atlantis' was moving, but the ending felt like a truck engine-braking. I love the way King writes, but it often feels like he meets his page count and just ends the story as quickly as possible.",""

He knew what he had done was inconsistent, and he wanted to fend off critics, so he put these words at the beginning of the book: ""Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot"".",""

 Its a kids book series, I remembered reading a litle bit of as a kid, but something about it stuck out to me enough to revist it later on in life. 

And I loved it! There is so much to love about it, and so much I felt was unique and worked really well. I was so into it. 

But something the series did, that was a double edge sword, was that it felt like a waiter adding more plates on top of an already giant tower they were carrying. Every installment, there would be a new ""big bad"" instead of going deeper into the already existing setups and expectations. 

Part of this nature worked really well for the pure adventure story that it was, and there was some interesting concepts for sure. But, especially in the last few installments, nothing was built up, just a new bad thing, and it didn't feel connected or setup in previous books. 

Then the *ending*, the last book.. felt like a complete throw away of the entire series. Like the author took everything from the main trio, their character arcs, etc, and just lite them on fire and burned em away for the fun of it. It was awful to me.   
I felt sick about it for a while after, genuinely. I was engulfed in the world and it was ripped and thrown out.

As it turns out though, this was likely intentional, as publishers didn't like the ending Adams had planned and pressured him to change it.

I greatly enjoyed the part near the very end where all those adults are falling over themselves trying to make sense of all this stuff that they think Jim did to orchestrate his escape, when it was all actually just Tom and Huck basically fucking around like kids do. I can't remember all the exact lines, but I was laughing pretty hard when they're all exasperated about ""who made this fake man, why did they dig that hole, who sawed the leg off that bed, how did they move that grindstone, what arcane language is written on that shirt?!""

Or if the redemption arc was for him to go save Rocky and then fulfill the expectation of a suicide mission. 

The flashbacks to his life on earth don’t give us anything that he cares about, except sorta his students, and he gets replacement students on Rocky’s planet, so he didn’t sacrifice anything to save Rocky, it wasn’t a redemption arc.

Tom  is a boy who grows up with his aunt and in a world where everything is fine and everything is a fairy tale. He is prone to romanticism and fantasies. Because he is a child and all the adults around him consider racism normal, and even victims of racism consider it the norm. He is inspired by stories about pirates, escapes and so on.
While Finn is a child whose father is an alcoholic and an abuser, he literally lived on the street for a while. What is comfort for others is torment for him. He is not used to the framework, comfort and is less influenced by adults. He has seen a lot of bad things in his life and he is more down-to-earth in his fantasies and understandings of life.

I have the Salmon of Doubt, but while enjoyable it doesn't really give any hints on how the finished book would have been.

If I were to introduce a new reader to the series I'd probably tell them to stop with the 4th.

However I'm not convinced it really makes sense. >!After giving birth the breast does not produce milk at once, just colostrum. It's so little that babies loose weight for two or three days because it's not enough to really sustain them. So there is no way it would save a grown man who hasn't eaten for days from dying of starvation. Also by breastfeeding, Rose gives her breast the signal to really start producing milk which is inconvenient since she doesn't have a baby to feed. Or does she plan on continue breastfeeding this guy? At this point it would really be getting awkward for me.!<

Apart from all that, I found really strange how the characters are acting about this. >! It's like some profecy is coming true for them. I would have expected a dialogue like ""Rose, it may seem like a really odd idea for you or maybe even gross and I totally understand if you say no if itakes you uncomfortable. But you could maybe let this stranger suck on your breast so he doesn't have to die."" But what we got was ""I think, you know what you have to do"" and Rose is like sure, it's like the only reason I have been born is so I can save this guy by feeding him my breastmilk."".!<

It just didn't feel believable to me at all, neither from a ""scientific"" nor a social point of view. I think I might have liked the ending if it had been written differently though.
