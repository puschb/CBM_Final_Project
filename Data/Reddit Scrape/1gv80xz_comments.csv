Think it is some of the laziest criticism out there (up there with 'important), and more often than not is based in a failure to take the work on its own terms. For instance - there is something of a meme that 'we are literally in 1984' or 'Orwell was so prescient'. 

Doing so, in my opinion at least, fails to recognise that Orwell was broadly writing about the world as he saw it at the time. It is a not particularly veiled criticism of the USSR and to a much lesser extent the Labour Party. To say he predicted the future is to miss what he was specifically criticising, and worse yet miss that he was describing a risk inherent to political organisation/community.",""

Edit: I don't know if it's commonly banned but it fits the dystopian category.","ly3s82t"

> ""Anyway, have you read a book where its plot, circumstance are **similar to world events** \\- or even your own life? Even if minute (a character quits a job and you did on the same day, a character is going through a break up like you are when reading it)""

I responded with a book that was timely due to being **SIMILAR** to world events that were current at the time. I never set up Covid as a comparison for anything. You really read way too deep into my responses, responding as if I was inferring that Covid was on the same scale as the  virus in the book, when all I did was point out how it was timely to the moment.

I just don't know how you went where you went based solely on 358 characters, yet here we are all the same.","ly0uj4v"
