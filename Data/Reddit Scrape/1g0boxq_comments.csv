My main dig is that the prize committee for the literature prize is so wildly cryptic. They'll dismiss authors like Rushdie and McCarthy (who I'd argue have made a bigger impact on the literary scene than most prize winners) as 'too popular' but then they'll give the prize to Bob Dylan, one of the most popular musicians of the 20th century XD

The committee is just oddly inconsistent in how it awards the prize. Moreso than any of the other Nobels. Sometimes they pick accomplished authors. Sometimes near-complete unknowns. I don't think they've ever picked a bad writer mind, but it's bizarre that the prize seems more like the committee's personal 'favorites' list than a meaningful literary achievement award.","lr8qhxs"

You are allowed to use words categorically wrong, and then tell others *they* are incorrect for noticing? So why is it exactly that you are the judge here? Why this deep need to use exactly the wrong word? Is it to be trendy?

I mean do words mean anything? Or is everything anything based on your whim?

It has somehow plowed straight through foolish and horseshoed back to almost being interesting.","lr8ehlo"

I thought an incel actually had to be unable to get laid and therefore resentful of women. 

Hugh Hefner might be sexist and a selfish person, but I don't think anyone would call him an incel.","lr8ehlo"
