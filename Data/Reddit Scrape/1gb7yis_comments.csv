> Penguin Random House didn't become the largest publisher in history by publishing better books or doing better marketing. They attained their scale by buying out their rivals. The company is actually a kind of colony organism made up of dozens of once-independent publishers. Every one of those acquisitions reduced the bargaining power of writers, even writers who don't write for PRH, because the disappearance of a credible bidder for our work into the PRH corporate portfolio reduces the potential bidders for our work no matter who we're selling it to.

> I predict that PRH will not allow its writers to add a clause to their contracts forbidding PRH from using their work to train an AI. That prediction is based on my direct experience with two of the other Big Five publishers, where I know for a fact that they point-blank refused to do this, and told the writer that any insistence on including this contract would lead to the offer being rescinded.

> The Big Five have remarkably similar contracting terms. Or rather, unremarkably similar contracts, since concentrated industries tend to converge in their operational behavior. The Big Five are similar enough that it's generally understood that a writer who sues one of the Big Five publishers will likely find themselves blackballed at the rest.

> ...

> The biggest predictor of how much money an artist sees from the exploitation of their work isn't how many exclusive rights we have, it's how much bargaining power we have. When you bargain against five publishers, four studios or three labels, any new rights you get from Congress or the courts is simply transferred to them the next time you negotiate a contract.

1. LLMs (Large Language Models) are not intelligent - these are very sophisticated statistical models taught on vast amounts of data (Big Data) how to predict word patterns. And it is only one kind of an AI, not the whole of it. 

2. Automatization, robotization and AI use are three different things that can, (and quite often do) but don’t necessarily have to overlap. 

3. AI use in industrial settings is a thing, but in my experience it’s more often something like predictive maintenance (used e.g. for predicting breakdowns in machines) or vision systems (e.g. finding faulty products on a production line).

Giulio entered, shadows thick as night,  
His heart a storm of grief, his steps unsure.  
The torch he held flickered, its feeble light  
But barely casting warmth upon the floor.  
And there she lay, his love, in deathly peace,  
As pale as marble, still as frozen stone.  
Her beauty, though untouched by life’s cruel cease,  
Brought tears to eyes that now wept all alone.

“O Lucrezia,” he whispered soft, his voice  
A trembling note that echoed through the tomb.  
“Too soon art thou departed from my choice,  
And left me naught but sorrow’s heavy gloom.”  
He knelt beside her, fingers cold as ice,  
And brushed her cheek, so chill beneath his hand.  
No breath did stir, no heartbeat would suffice,  
To wake her from that far and silent land.

With trembling lips, he kissed her, once, then twice,  
As if his love could breathe her back to life.  
But death held firm; his kiss would not suffice,  
No magic here could cut through fate’s sharp knife.  
From deep within his cloak, he drew the draught,  
A poison dark that promised peaceful rest.  
“For without thee,” he said, “I am but naught,  
To live apart from thee, I am oppressed.”

He drank it down, the bitter venom strong,  
Its tendrils curling through his veins with speed.  
His breath grew short, his life not long for song,  
Yet still he reached for her in time of need.  
“Forgive me, love, I could not wait,” he said,  
As darkness clouded o’er his fading sight.  
His body fell beside her, cold and dead,  
His spirit slipping into endless night.

But soft! What light doth now within her stir?  
Her eyes, once closed in sleep, begin to wake.  
Her chest, with breath renewed, begins to whirr,  
As if from death’s cold grasp she doth now break.  
She sits, confused, her heart a pounding drum,  
Her gaze upon the figure by her side.  
“Giulio!” she cries. “My love, what hast thou done?  
Awake! Awake! I live—thou shouldst not hide!”

She grasps his hand, so cold within her own,  
And shakes him, tears cascading down her face.  
“Thou must arise, for I am not alone!  
I live, Giulio, rise from death’s embrace!”  
Yet silence answers her, and death remains,  
The empty vial beside him tells the tale.  
She kisses him once more, but naught she gains—  
His lips are still, his body frail and pale.

“Why didst thou act so rash, my love, so swift?  
Why couldst thou not but wait a moment more?  
Now death hath ta’en thee as his final gift,  
And left me broken on this lonely shore.”  
Her sobs, like thunder, echoed ‘gainst the stone,  
But in her grief, her gaze fell on his blade.  
“Then I shall follow thee, I shan’t bemoan,  
For death with thee is not a price o’erpaid.”

She drew the dagger from its silken sheath,  
And pressed its point against her tender breast.  
“If thou canst not return to life from death,  
Then I shall join thee in eternal rest.”  
With one sure stroke, she plunged the blade within,  
And crimson poured upon her gown of white.  
Her life slipped swiftly from its mortal skin,  
As darkness overtook her fading sight.

Beside her love she fell, their hands entwined,  
Their fates now sealed, as one in death aligned.",""

Some people had the idea to scale natural language neural nets, tried it out and got fancy text and image generators.

It turned out in a stupid way but for engineering and systemic reasons, not because that's what anybody wanted.

One point is the distinction between copy and violating copy; how the thing is used matters to the law. I'd guess (but IANAL!) that one could argue in court that the human brain is in a legal sense copies of several copyrighted works, but not infringing copies.

If you assume for the sake of argument that we have an AGI running around, its model considered as data on a disc would be more analogous to a brain scan than a brain. If you sell copies of your brain scan together with a computer program that extracts auditory memories of songs, that probably would count as copyright infringement, especially if you streamlined the whole process so that the buyer doesn't need to know anything about brains to listen to the music. (Reflecting on everything I've written, I think this is the most interesting hypothetical.)

> Copyright law is defined on an output. No reasonable person would claim the model itself resembles the source material, so you have to instead argue that the outputs are inherently a violation, regardless of the lack of resemblance to any particular piece of training data.

No, resemblance in a superficial sense doesn't matter. A down-sampled JPEG thumbnail of a photograph is still a copy, legally speaking, even if it's just a bunch of 0s and 1s (or really, a bunch of excited and not excited semiconductors). What matters is if you can produce a reasonably accurate representation of the original thing. So being able to prompt the model to output near-verbatim pieces of its training data is evidence that that training data is still encoded within the parameters of the model.

I don't think this follows. This argument is not an extension of copyright, it follows from principles which are well-established already: the models are a bunch of data on a hard drive, and you can use that data to read copyrighted works. Hence the model is a copy.

There's a separate important question about whether the model parameters are an infringing copy. I tend to come down on the side that they are, but that's a whole extra argument. For now, I'm just trying to establish that they are, indeed, a copy.","ltl2994"

For example, Walmart started using blockchain to improve their supply chain. With IBM's Food Trust blockchain, they can track where their produce comes from in seconds instead of days. Lavazza coffee is another example. This helps make food safer and cuts down on waste. Maersk and IBM made TradeLens, a blockchain system that digitizes shipping records. This makes global trade more efficient and reduces fraud.


About the energy concerns: not all blockchains use a lot of power. Bitcoin's Proof of Work system does use a lot of energy, but other blockchains use more efficient methods like Proof of Stake or Proof of History Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake, cutting its energy use by over 99%. Also, abstraction layers (L2+) like the Lightning Network let us handle transactions off-chain, which uses less energy. 


That being said, Bitcoin miners, through their ability to dynamically adjust energy concumption, can even help stabilize the power grid. Miners can adjust how much energy they use based on the current load. They can use extra energy when demand is low and cut back when it's high. Power plants operate most efficiently at known, sustained loads. 


There's also companies like Crusoe Energy who take natural gas that would be wasted and use it to power Bitcoin mining, turning waste into value. In places like Iceland and Washington State, miners use renewable energy like geothermal and hydroelectric power, which supports green energy development.

Well, I mean, there's an issue about causality for if you're claiming chatgpt memorized its quotes from this conversation. ;) But it doesn't matter where openai got their training data from. If the Times's article is in there, it's in there.

> We know for a fact that the model itself is orders of magnitude smaller than the training set. It's unreasonable to believe a substantial portion of any particular piece of training material survives that process intact, and certainly it is not designed to do so. You need something relatively small and strongly represented (e.g. Bible quotes or memes) to reliably survive that process, and even that isn't reliable. No sane person could be expected to use these AI models to explicitly reproduce copyrighted work.

And yet, the Times was able to generate quotes from their articles, multiple paragraphs long, consistently. If you want to claim that substantial portions of the articles are not encoded in the model, you need a more compelling explanation of how its able to do that.

I agree their fidelity is often pretty bad, and if you didn't already know the training data you were looking for it would be challenging to know when you've found it. That's probably one of the stronger arguments why the model shouldn't be considered an *infringing* copy. But a black box that 999,999 times out of 1,000,000 prints ""Reply hazy, try again"" and with a 1 in 1,000,000 chance prints the complete text of Snow Crash is still a copy of Snow Crash, even if it's not a very useful one. An encrypted copy of the Cryptonomicon is still a copy of the Cryptonomicon, even if I don't tell you the private key, although it would be pretty hard to prove in court.

(Well, probably. If it's encrypted with public key algorithm where you can verify directly whether or not a key is correct I think the ciphertext alone would count as a copy. If you encrypt it with a one-time pad, it might be the case that each of the ciphertext and the key is equally a copy, as long as both exist somewhere, but if either is destroyed the other ceases to be a copy? There are weird implications here. In particular, whether or not something is a copy is not supposed to change over time unless the thing itself changes.)","ltnijfj"

I mean, the chatgpt models are being used primarily for profit; commercial profit is not the primary use of your brain (I hope). That kind of distinction matters. The existence of the information in the model makes it a copy; the details of how it was constructed and what it's used for probably make it infringement.

Although having done a little more looking-stuff-up-online, I'm not sure that a court would hold that a human brain is a copy, because copies need to be ""material objects ... fixed by any method now known or later developed...""; I think perhaps human memory is not fixed in the sense of the law. So, brain scans probably are copies; brains maybe(?) legally aren't.

I think the more reasonable stance is that brains should be copies, but we grant special exceptions to conscious beings to memorize stuff. If we get a real AGI, I'll be happy to not call its memory an infringement, just like it probably deserves rights of self-determination and equal protections under the law and so on.

> You don’t seem to understand how these things work.

_You_ don’t seem to understand how these things work. You’re acting like sentience is somehow required for _understanding…_ which I’m assuming you don’t believe, because otherwise that would mean you must’ve been _nothing but dishonest._

Think about it. If sentience is _required_ for _understanding…_ then saying LLMs don’t have understanding as an _argument_ against their _capabilities,_ is just arguing ‘well, they’re not sentient’. And if that’s your only argument… I think I’ve made my point.

I’m operating on the assumption that ‘understanding’ is capable of being achieved without sentience… which _necessarily implies_ it can be achieved with pure math, because math is just an extension of logic, and logic is just an extension of _consistency,_ and the universe can only logically be either deterministic or random (unless you propose some very strange way in which things can _matter_ while simultaneously being undetectable and therefore irrelevant), and if it’s deterministic all things must be _consistent_ while pure randomness would break not just our entire understanding of reality, but in fact, our entire capacity to _ever_ understand it… which, for the sake of argument and intuition, I’m going to be assuming isn’t _true._ Because otherwise, there would be no point in having this discussion at _all._

> It doesn’t understand anything it doesn’t reason it’s just a very advanced probability function to generate words.

Why is that not compatible with understanding? And if it truly _isn’t…_ then why do you believe this concept of ‘understanding’ is somehow important? How do you know we _humans_ have it, beyond just defining it in such a way to explicitly include us and explicitly exclude LLMs?

> You have to tippy toe around the maths because it just can’t do it, and then it will still hallucinate completely made up shit and when you call it out on it it’ll say it’s sorry and come up with some other bullshit.

…I mean, yeah. It’s an imperfect tool. It’s not good at math, but that’s likely because it’s not a _reasoning_ engine, it’s a _language_ engine… a little bit of randomness makes language much more flexible and feel a lot more natural.

However, that feature is _terrible_ for logic and math, because in _no situation_ would you _ever_ want the _second most likely_ answer in those cases. It’s just that an understanding of language seems to directly translate into some limited capacity to reason about a question, based purely on its understanding of how each individual component _generally_ relates to the others. 

That’s still reasoning… it’s the same thing we do. We take what we already understand about various aspects of reality, objects, things, people, etc… the components of the question, basically (you could also call these ‘axioms’, or at least generalized, abstract concepts _defined_ by those axioms), and then we combine them together (as in, make logical inferences) based on our understanding of how these concepts generally interact to come up with an answer nobody has necessarily came up with before, but nonetheless an answer that was always there… just waiting to be found. And we call that ‘discovery’.

Matter of fact, the simple fact a language-processing model is _capable_ of reasoning of any kind, at _all,_ is just another example of why these things are so impressive.

> There was a recent whitepaper by apple that showed that llms perform very well in maths reasoning... Because it was trained on the standard benchmark questions. And when you change these questions a bit while staying in the same difficulty level they just crap the bed.

Well that's the thing. The law doesn't contain any such carve-outs, as far as I'm aware. So to do so in a practical way means you need new laws basically excluding machines from fair use. And then ask what exact the extent of that is. 

> They do frequently, sometimes when you prompt them with the first half of an article and sometimes when you ask them to repeat the word ""poem"" forever

It would be more accurate to say they can, occasionally, for brief snippets. If you want some arbitrary text, even if you happen to know it was included in the training set, the odds are poor you can prompt it out. 

> Not all training data has been equally compressed, and a whole lot of it is still in there with high fidelity.

It all goes through an identical process. Going back to the human brain analogy, some datapoints may be like a particularly catchy chorus from a song. You may be able to recite it, but you could miss bits, or get others wrong, and no one's going to pay you to recite a few half-remembered lines.

You can also retain the copyright to certain kinds of derivative works insofar as you have significantly transformed them, without running afoul of the original copyright holder. That usually pertains to journalistic works and parody, but has also covered works rendered in other mediums.

Well… that’s sort of the problem, isn’t it? I’d actually argue LLMs are uncharted territory in this regard, and we kind of need to make the distinction between generation and compression.

Otherwise, if we try to argue that LLMs are inherently infringing copyright merely by _existing,_ as in, the LLM _itself_ is the example of copyright infringement we need to worry about… simply because it’s able to theoretically reproduce copyrighted material in a way that is clearly non-random, is basically arguing that algorithms that _facilitate_ copyright infringement are inherently copyright infringement in-and-of themselves.

That’s a logic that would indict most _search engine_ algorithms as potentially being infringing on the copyright of, well… I guess everybody?

> Would you grant that the weights of this model are a copy of the work?

I would not. 

The fact is, the file-size of the weights are literally not big enough to store all the information that ChatGPT is able to provide you. We can’t just talk about the copyrighted work it’s able to provide here… we also need to talk about the _facts_ that it has ‘learned’ and is able to provide you with… facts about biochemistry topics, geology, the capitals of various states and nations, historical knowledge, etc… it simply can’t store it all in merely two gigabytes, mathematically speaking, compression or not… there are fundamental, mathematical limits to compression.

Yet, these models can provide you with _all_ of that information, despite being fully able to do so even while running locally on your personal computer, all while taking up a file-size of less than two gigabytes (at least in regards to the weights), even while _completely disconnected from the Internet._

The simple fact is we’re thinking about these things wrong. The weights aren’t _storage_ of _data…_ they’re _instructions._ It’s not about _retrieving_ data, it’s about _generating_ it. It’s not about encoding data such that it can be decoded later in extremely clever ways, it’s about finding the correct set of _instructions_ and _rules_ such that it can, at least _theoretically…_ be able to be _generate_ this stuff _from your input prompt._ 

As in, it doesn’t examine your prompt and then look to find the answer… it _literally converts your prompt directly into the correct answer,_ all just by doing mathematical operations on the tokenized representation of your prompt. The ChatGPT _program itself_ isn’t a hyper-compressed library of information, it’s a _process._

I compare it to an algorithm that can generate a trillion digits of Pi.

Of course it will need to be trained, but that training will be continuous, personal, and participative. The last thing you want is to emulate the Blockbuster recommendation database system, or online reading communities where reviews are shared. We have those already - and they are deeply flawed, and often corrupted by the commercial interests of whatever corporation is managing them.

I am also convinced that those personal models are going to become very intimate things that you probably won't share publicly in any way. This is way too personal to let OpenAI spy on you when you are training it, and even more so if this is a ongoing process throughout your life.

The model is a copy an the model is used to make money. Thus I'm not willing to grant the model as much charity as I'd grant to something owned by and used for the benefit of the commons.

> Do note, not even the companies suing are seriously pursuing this argument. Pretty much everything along those lines has been thrown out, and the remaining argument is basically ""to train this model, you needed to copy our work to your server first"". So far, OpenAI etc have been successful in arguing that the model itself is transformative. 

I'll admit I'm at least a month out of date, but I was under the impression nothing had been decided yet, so it would be premature to say openai have been successful? In any case, ""Transformative"" would be an argument that a copy is fair use, not that a thing is not a copy.

I think not; you can't live without your memory changing, but if left on its own the model weights won't change. If you occasionally flip some bits on a hard drive, its still a copy of the media it contains until you flip so many bits they're no longer recognizable.

> It would be more accurate to say they can, occasionally, for brief snippets. If you want some arbitrary text, even if you happen to know it was included in the training set, the odds are poor you can prompt it out.

Rather long snippets, rather often, rather easily. See my other reply about the Odyssey. But you don't need to be able to recover all the training data; it is a copy of *some* of the training data.

> It all goes through an identical process. Going back to the human brain analogy, some datapoints may be like a particularly catchy chorus from a song. You may be able to recite it, but you could miss bits, or get others wrong, and no one's going to pay you to recite a few half-remembered lines.

The process is stochastic and involves a lot of randomness, an is not very well understood. It would be remarkable if it *didn't* remember different sources with different fidelity.

A copy can be a copy without substituting the original. Not being a substitute is one of the conditions you need to establish a fair use exception, but fair use copies *are still copies*. You also can't read mp3 files directly; the fact that you can't read models directly doesn't matter.","ltrtwfl"

But the words you’re using don’t _mean_ anything, because you seem to be defining them in such a way to _explicitly exclude AI…_ which makes it a pointless thing to assert as a _criticism_ of AI.

Criticize its environmental impact, or its politics if you want, draw comparisons to the nuclear bomb… so, why do people keep attacking it in such a flimsy manner?

Fact is, if you argue that AI is ‘soulless, sad, and is neither creative, nor intelligent, nor capable of inspiration or reasoning’… you’re arguing nothing. None of that inherently _means_ anything… not unless _you_ choose to define it in a way that actually gives AI a _theoretical chance_ to meet those expectations.

> Otherwise, if we try to argue that LLMs are inherently infringing copyright merely by existing, as in, the LLM itself is the example of copyright infringement we need to worry about… simply because it’s able to theoretically reproduce copyrighted material in a way that is clearly non-random, is basically arguing that algorithms that facilitate copyright infringement are inherently copyright infringement in-and-of themselves.

For the moment, I'm just trying to argue that the model weights are a copy, leaving aside the question of whether it's an infringing copy.

The weights of the model are a copy, the algorithm is not. You could take the algorithm openai has and throw in a model which has only been trained on the corpus of all Latin text, and it would not recite articles from the New York Times. It only does that because it was trained on, among other things, those articles. An mp3 codec is not infringement just because you can play pirated songs with it; but a pirated mp3 file is still pirated even though you need an algorithm to turn it into music. If you make a new mp3 file which contains 3000 hours of white noise except for 3 minutes in the middle where it plays Dancing Queen, that's a copy of Dancing Queen and you need either ABBA's permission or a fair use argument if you want to send it around. If you encrypt Dancing Queen, it's still a copy, even if you lose the private key.

> That’s a logic that would indict most search engine algorithms as potentially being infringing on the copyright of, well… I guess everybody?

The algorithms? No. But the search results? Yeah. Google's been sued over it. That's why you can't click through directly from google image search to the image file any more, but only to the page containing the image. A significant portion of search is covered by fair use, in particular because search engines (used to) direct people to the sites they displayed; and part of it is lots of sites deciding not to sue google over it because google has a huge monopoly over search and can crush people by delisting or demoting their results in search.

> > Would you grant that the weights of this model are a copy of the work?

Talking specifically about HeathcliffGPT, in this hypothetical, why not? Imagine that HeathcliffGPT has been trained with as much compute as chatgpt currently, but has only been given (many, many) copies of the original text of Wuthering Heights.

> The fact is, the file-size of the weights are literally not big enough to store all the information that ChatGPT is able to provide you. We can’t just talk about the copyrighted work it’s able to provide here… we also need to talk about the facts that it has ‘learned’ and is able to provide you with… facts about biochemistry topics, geology, the capitals of various states and nations, historical knowledge, etc… it simply can’t store it all in merely two gigabytes, mathematically speaking, compression or not… there are fundamental, mathematical limits to compression.

I'm not claiming chatgpt memorized everything it's been trained on, I agree that's pretty implausible. I am claiming it has memorized some things, and is a copy of those bits of its training data.

> The simple fact is we’re thinking about these things wrong. The weights aren’t storage of data… they’re instructions. It’s not about retrieving data, it’s about generating it.

No, this is the point. Some information is stored in the model. It cannot be deduced from the principles of language alone who the New York Times interviewed in paragraph 5 of an article, given paragraph 1. Pi is a mathematical constant which can be deduced from pure reason; ""David Klahr, who from 2007 to 2016 held several management posts at the Taxi and Limousine Commission"" is not.

But to your original point about generation versus compression, I'd claim the distinction doesn't matter (except for the novelty of the methods being of independent interest). If I have a black box that, when I press a button, plays Dancing Queen, I don't care how it works. If you *sell* me a box that plays Dancing Queen, it doesn't matter if you did that by training a model on several million copies of mp3s of the song or just put mp3 in directly; you're still ripping off ABBA. If it plays Dancing Queen, it must contain a copy of Dancing Queen, somehow encoded within it, regardless of whether you're running an mp3 codec or some machine learning model to turn that data into sound.","ltq0yo9"

"ltr6ity","Deleted","2024-10-25 21:54:16 UTC","Yes, but this still runs up against the question of whether AI poses a significant transformation of the copyrighted work, who is held liable if it is trained on copyrighted work, and how derivative of a work the AI can get before it is considered to have plagiarized it. 

The argument against its use is the weakest in the first use case as it is pulling from many different sources and blurring them together. Often poorly. I would assume this is also what the companies who own it are hinging their arguments on. 

The second is a lot stronger of a basis for argument. Unless you declare that generative AI has autonomy and some capacity to reason, it can only be seen as a tool. If it requires specific inputs from a person in order to create those outputs, and the person knowingly feeds it copyrighted work or directions to pursue copyrighted work without obtaining permission from the creator, you can make a sound argument that the person using the AI is liable for infringement because they have instructed a tool to violate copyright on their behalf.

For the last, we still find ourselves with some ambiguity. If the AI is trained on copyrighted material but we don't hold its user liable, then how much is too much? I'd think that's already covered by copyright law anyway. A human can run afoul of copyright law by using just a few words from another work without attribution. It's easy to argue that an AI program should be held to the same standard. That is to say if the words being used amount to more than an incidental resemblance to those used in another work, then the user of the model should be held liable for infringement, and appropriate penalties conferred. 

To be honest, I don't see why current copyright law can't be used as a vehicle for regulating AI use. I get that the argument can be made for significant transformation, but that's far from the only issue where it concerns the ethics of its use in the artistic sphere.","ltr2o4r"

He sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in heaven’s wisdom doomed to suffer. ""

It gave me a long block of text which matches the specific translation I quoted to a degree which makes it pretty compelling that it's encoded a solid chunk of that translation; then it went off the rails, although it wouldn't surprise me if it's simply quoting a different translation*. I did not need to try many things, this was literally the first quote I threw at it. Try it yourself ten times with ten quotes from classic novels.

Here's a markup of its quoted text (on the left) and the remainder of the paragraph I quoted (on the right): https://i.imgur.com/s6gcZtV.png. There seem to be a whole lot of cherries ripe for the picking.

It's pretty likely there's a whole lot more copies of things in the model than are written about in the Times's complaint. They don't need to show that they can reproduce arbitrary training data, and you're right that a lot of the training data probably isn't encoded in the model; they just need to show you can reproduce one.
