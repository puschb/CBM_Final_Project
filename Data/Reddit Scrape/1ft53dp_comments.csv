My favorite use of it was in his book, The Heroes. There‚Äôs a chapter called casualties in which we follow a soldier in a massive battle that is then killed and then we follow their killer‚Äôs POV. He repeats that method a few times in that single chapter and it brilliantly captures the dizzying nature of being in a battle.",""

Definitely can understand if an author wields it poorly, as it does make things more complex, and complexity doesn‚Äôt mean quality lol. But when done well, I‚Äôve always enjoyed how much it can help a story with pacing. Certain storylines are sort of by definition going to be slower paced, and so mixing in different storylines can help break up slower storylines so they‚Äôre not as much a slog and also leave like cliffhangers that I think add to the tension.

POV chapters with other characters can give a broader picture of the world and various events that are in motion. They‚Äôre great worldbuilding and foreshadowing tools. It can also serve to give outsider perspectives on a lead instead of riding around in their head all book.

If you‚Äôve got a couple leads, it works so long as they‚Äôre all interesting. You can trade perspectives when they‚Äôre together without interrupting the action, hop somewhere interesting during a lull, or pull cliffhangers.

"lppqvtd","No_Tamanegi","2024-09-30 21:28:33 UTC","The first set of books I really identified with this writing style was ASOIAF, and after a while, I grew to hate it. Mostly because he just seemed to be including other characters and perspectives in service of expanding the world, but not in service of the particular story he was telling at the time. More often than not, he would introduce new characters, and it would be unclear how they would be pertinent to the main story (or whichever part of the story you were invested in) for a very, very long time.

Counter to this, I came to love this type of storytelling with The Expanse series. Ironically, the authors of that series are both worked under GRRM. In their case, for each book in the series, they would select 4-5 characters and just keep to their perspective to tell the story of that book. The resultant effect is that you got a few different perspectives, but they were all in the service of moving the same story forward. You also often got a wildcard for the prologue and epilogue, but those worked to either set the stage, or set up some foreboding for what is to come.

Its a more television style of novel writing, since most TV scenes tell the story of a particular group of characters or a single character. But I figure we're all multimedia enthusiasts here.",""

It can also highlight the differences between perception and reality, such as switching from character A, who thinks that B is calm, cool, collected, and totally in to of things, to B's perspective where we can see that actually B is just flying by the seat of their pants, panicked that they're going to fuck up, but desperately trying to put in a show of confidence to hide all of that, but certain it's not working, even though we, as the readers, know it's working perfectly.",""

"lpv97te","jeffythunders","2024-10-01 20:18:12 UTC","Yeah, kinda. I feel like the author can get each characters nuances and points across without changing the pov every chapter. The switching back and forth seems like a new trend, almost","lpv5p91"
"lpqijiq","joshuastar","2024-10-01 00:15:44 UTC","see, constantly switching feels more like a lower level of writing to me.","lppiozt"
"lppi5va","1UrbanGroove","2024-09-30 20:41:22 UTC","Yeah it‚Äôs a definite highlight in an already incredible fantasy war book. Your mile may vary with the rest of the series since he does follow the traditional POV change chapters-to-chapter. I personally love his POV chapters since each character is distinct from each other. The prose changes to match the character‚Äôs mindset and he‚Äôs great at characterization.","lpph9cr"

"lpphnfx","SmokeyBare","2024-09-30 20:38:41 UTC","Also, one character would meet another and not know who they are, but would describe them, and, as the reader, your like, ""Oh shit, I know exactly who that is. Run!""","lppf97c"
"lpqcy5n","zaosafler","2024-09-30 23:41:26 UTC","It depends on how the writer does it. 

This weekend I tried to read one book that was flashing between different people at different points in time. But not consistently. Sometimes a couple of chapters in a row would be the same POV. Sometimes I would be several paragraphs in before realizing the book had gone back in time. 20% of the way through it, and I was confused, annoyed, and still had no idea what the book was about.

The 2nd book I picked up had little headings at the beginning of each chapter to let you know the geographic and temporal location of this bit of the book. And that worked really well at keeping things straight.","lppf97c"
"lpqg04e","HeyItsTheMJ","2024-10-01 00:00:08 UTC","If she was smart, she would have done multiple pov from the beginning. I knew what was going to happen by the end of the book because of the switch.","lpphqi3"
"lpqyanr","Caelinus","2024-10-01 01:53:18 UTC","This is the big one for me. If it gets to be too long between each perspective it kills the suspense in each viewpoint, so I get constant cliffhangers without the emotional payoff of resolution. 

My favorite way of doing multiple perspectives is to have a main point of view, with a bunch of minor ones that rotate to give greater context to the main POV. It can especially be helpful if the story is written without an omniscient viewpoint, as those viewpoint changes can provide alternative interpretations of the actions or events.","lppgx9y"

"lpt3wcl","Raff57","2024-10-01 13:21:25 UTC","It is a technique.  Some authors are good at it.  Tom Clancy and John Birmingham come to mind.  Some of their books are seat of the pants thrillers when using the multiple POV's.

But there are many authors who try to write that way and end up just making a mess.","lpqcy5n"
