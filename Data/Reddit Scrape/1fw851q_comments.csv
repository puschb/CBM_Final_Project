I've also read Daisy Jones & the Six and boy, if you disliked this one for quick resolutions and lack of real, detailed struggle, you'll hate that novel so much. Avoid it! Watch Fleetwood Mac behind the music instead.",""
"lqcxrzj","Silly_Somewhere1791","2024-10-04 20:43:02 UTC","It’s a combination of Rita Hayworth (abused by her father; Cuban passing as white) and Elizabeth Taylor (shrewd femme fatale who won an Oscar and married a million times). It wasn’t a brilliant book but it reads better when you know the inspirations and can fill in the gaps yourself. 

That said, it’s the same >!daughter/interviewer!< twist as Daisy Jones. ",""
"lqcxf4h","No_Confidence5235","2024-10-04 20:41:03 UTC","I think the struggle wasn't really about making it as an actor; that part came more easily to her largely because of her beauty. The struggle was more about hiding her sexual orientation and her same-sex relationship because she was a public figure during a time where LGBT people, especially celebrities, generally had to remain in the closet.",""
"lqcse22","October_13th","2024-10-04 20:13:08 UTC","She’s compared to Marilyn Monroe because of all the alterations she had to go through to become famous. So dyed blond hair, new name, seductress persona, that kind of thing. 

Her marriages & love life *were* the struggle. She is >!lesbian or bisexual!< and can’t be with the person she really loves. Her whole life is constantly choosing between her fame and her real life. She chooses fame until finally she doesn’t. 

Her most lasting marriage was to a >!gay man!< who was the only person who could really understand her predicament. But he ultimately ended up choosing differently than her if I remember correctly. He chose a more private life and less fame? I think? 

The reason she chose Monique to tell her story is because she feels immensely guilty that she’s been keeping her ex husband’s secret about >!being Monique’s dead father’s lover and being the reason he was driving when he crashed the car and died. But she had to promise not to say anything since that would have revealed all of their true identities,!< and she is trying to explain why that was such a big deal at the time. 

I think the book went viral on TikTok for the wrong reasons. People didn’t want to spoil the nature of her relationships so they sort of overemphasized the “vibes” and the movie star qualities of Evelyn Hugo but I don’t think that was really the point of the book. It was more about people struggling with their identity and trying to choose between fame and their public image vs their private life and true identity. 

It’s not the best book I’ve ever read, but I thought it was interesting!",""
"lqctpbo","Deleted","2024-10-04 20:20:23 UTC","i feel like this is unpopular opinion but the way i see it is that Evelyn Hugo is a narcissist. the book tells us about her ""struggles"" because that's what Evelyn wants us to know, that she is a victim of circumstances. but the more you get to know her story it shows that what led to her misery is mostly her own selfish choices and imo, karma as well. it's what made the book interesting for me and i liked it for that reason.",""
"lqcpjmc","bepis118","2024-10-04 19:57:28 UTC","1) I think 7 Husbands is fine for what it is and is honestly overhated- I think you were maybe expecting literary fiction or maybe a thriller/mystery when this is basically a step above a beach read, maybe upmarket book club fare. It covers Evelyn’s entire life in like 300 pages so while it does “tell” a little too much, this is necessary. It’s meant to be a lighter read with enough twists and turns to keep you interested. 

2) Evelyn is not a “Mary Sue” just because they don’t show enough of her struggling. That’s not what a Mary sue is. A Mary Sue would basically be wish fulfillment. Evelyn has plenty of flaws, she can’t openly be with Celia and they have a tumultuous relationship, her daughter passes away….its hard to see where she is a Mary Sue. She has a successful career, sure, but there would literally be no book if she didn’t, and characters are allowed to have good things happen to them.

Basically you’re going to Olive Garden and complaining that they don’t serve enchiladas.",""

Close friends (who also work closely) never see or speak unless it was on a movie set, restaurants or something that was setup.  The journalist (Monique) felt flat despite all the other stuff that happened, she never questioned or worked to get more details, may as well have been a tape recorder.  Evelyn Hugo felt heartless to me, she used people to the point of cruelty.  There are a lot of ways a better writer would have handled the situations.

"lqdlpgq","Immediate-War2731","2024-10-04 23:08:39 UTC","I agree I think Monique as a non character. I understood why Evelyn chose her to do the interview but I felt the twist was cheap and it was too late in the book to get a proper resolution.  Monique had no character development throughout the story. I wished Monique’s story parallel Evelyn’s - like a Julie and Julia type story.
I also was annoyed with how Monique never challenged Evelyn - always tried to justified her actions, how she wasn’t in the wrong and was a victim. 
Same with her being Cuban - I wished we could see Evelyn struggle with allowing herself to be whitewashed in Hollywood and the media - maybe show her having internalized racism against Hispanics and think less of other actors who have the same or similar ethnic background as her. Hollywood and the media have historic racist past and it would have been interesting to see how Evelyn dealt with this and how it played into her romantic life. 

I did enjoy Daisy Jones and the Six more. Did not like the ending- it completely erased the reason why choosing and staying with Cecilia as the right choice for Billy. Also I wished Cecilia had something going for her outside of Billy and their girls. She should have been seen as a designer whether interior or fashion. Cecilia is the cool girl that is mentioned in Gone Girl (if that makes sense).",""

Daisy Jones is apparently a stand-in for Fleetwood Mac, and I always thought of Evelyn not as Marilyn Monroe but as Elizabeth Taylor. That’s when I decided to not read any more of her books.

"lqd042l","Odd-Drawer9226","2024-10-04 20:55:59 UTC","I’m so grateful for this post! I hate this book so much! :D My expectations were too high for it, and it’s not even a mid read.

No struggle - agree a big time. For me, it was strange how she didn’t talk much about being Cuban expect for being raised up in a poor area (which told me nothing as I’m not American) and dying her hair to get more roles. And when her new Cuban maid didn’t realize Evelyn is Cuban, Evelyn had a sudden thought about loosing her roots or something…. It was a short and sudden sentence, so I don’t even know what to think of it. She didn’t even notice Cuban’s revolution, that was mentioned in the background. The same for Monique - “I was not like the others. But I got a cool job, and my boss is also not white.” Ok, I guess? Am I supposed to feel something for these characters? Same for being gay - I felt no struggle in here. “If they know, they will come after us” - this way you can be anxious about anything, I.e. “what if meteor falls on my house? What if i walk late at night and something bad happens to me?” I didn’t feel that Evelyn and co were in danger.

But the biggest thing I hate about it (idk if you read it or not) is Evelyn herself : >! In the end, she noticed that she was aging, and she stopped receiving interesting (= sexualized) roles. She hated it and decided to finish her career. And aaaaafter that, she was finally ready to choose Cecilia and live “without hiding”. So, with 7 husbands and 1 love of her life, she loved no one. She did everything that suited her and no one else. Somehow it’s supposed to be an inspiring feministic figure, when in fact she is just a selfish attention-seeker” !<",""

What in the heck? That book is a memoir, not historical fiction.

But I generally don’t like it when stories are structured that way, so it’s not a personal thing against this one. The chapters/sections from Evelyn’s POV were fine overall, but I loathed the parts with the interviewer lady. Like, I didn’t care about her whole subplot with her ex-husband or whoever the fuck he was at all. It was just so boring to me. Also, the writing of the book itself just kind of got on my nerves. I read it quite a while ago now, but I believe the “present day” sections were told in first person (I don’t remember if Evelyn’s chapters were or not) and all the “I” statements in them started to really annoy me as the novel went on. Because, from what I remember, sentence after sentence would start with “I”. Like, I did this, I went here, I, I, I. And that’s why I usually don’t like first person POV in books. It gets way too repetitive way too fast. And aside from that, the writing also just felt a bit too simplistic, I guess? Like, it had a YA vibe to it even though it’s not YA. Which you might think you make it easier and quicker to get through, as the writing style is by no means flowery or anything like that, but I STRUGGLED to push through this book. I had to set it aside after reading like maybe the first 100 or 150 pages and then I literally didn’t finish it until like a year or 2 later. That’s how much I just couldn’t get into it. The ending part, like explaining what happened to Evelyn and Cecelia and all that, was fine. I enjoyed getting to learn what happened to them and how their relationship eventually ended up. But the actual ending of the novel was just kinda meh, imo. Again, there was no point during the story where I actually cared about the interviewer lady. I never felt connected to her as a character. She just kinda fell flat to me, and compared to Evelyn I don’t think she was fleshed out nearly enough. I think I ended up rating the book 3 out of 5 stars on Goodreads.",""

I have been reading the Daevabad trilogy by S A Chakraborty at the same time I was reading Evelyn. It is a really rich fantasy with excellent world building and lots of politics.

Personally, I don’t think I really ever bought in to the central love story between Evelyn and Celia so it’s not a top tier read for me. But OP’s gripes don’t make sense -  this book covers Evelyn’s entire life so yes, certain parts (like Evelyn working as a waitress before she becomes famous) are skipped past, but that doesn’t mean Evelyn is a “Mary sue”.

It sounds like OP wanted something similar to “A Little Life” where Evelyn’s experiences with childhood abuse or DV are a central part of the story and like…this just isn’t that book. Personally I would have preferred the book to skip past a lot of Evelyn’s earlier life precisely so we have more time to explore Evelyn and Celia’s relationship. 

 I think this book was hyped precisely because it is a step above “BookTok” romance/smut fare while still being a very widely accessible book that you can finish in a weekend. I think it’s a great book for people who are just getting into reading.","lqd6ytq"

I felt she barely cared for her daughter until after her friend/daughter’s father died.  All of this shows the weakness of Monique’s skill as journalist and the author.  But the book is popular so what do I know but it could have been a lot better.  And normally I would be type to say no point in looking for depth in a shallow pond because this book is not worth it.

"lqft88a","Odd-Drawer9226","2024-10-05 11:08:07 UTC","I cannot copy the whole book and paste here, but Evelyn is always portrayed as a strong, independent woman, who got it all. We see it in the articles, blog posts, Monique’s reaction to Evelyn. We see it from Evelyn herself, talking about her determination to build a career and be on top. I’ll be glad to listen to you if I’m wrong, but I don’t see anything in the text that would contradict this statement.

A few things that I consider cruical:

1. The book was dedicated to someone with the words “smash the patriarchy, sweetheart”; - a clear message from the author of what she had in mind while writing the story.

2. During the interview, Evelyn is basically teaching Monique that you have to be like me, or you will not succeed. And Monique end up doing what Evelyn taught her to (doing what SHE wants, no matter what it means to others), which looks like she is following Evelyn’s advice. So, Monique accepts Evelyn’s lessons and continue her route? I know irl I’d do the same thing, but for the story’s sake, if Evelyn is supposed to be a bad person according to the author, there should have been hints. Instead, there are a lot of parts that glorify Evelyn, and none, where the author condemns her actions or behavior. I expected the author to channel her “actual” feelings through Monique by rejecting writing a book, saying a narcissist doesn’t deserve the sympathy. See next point.

3. Monique has been respecting Evelyn through the whole story until the end: “I know she is ok. She has the right to die as she lived, entirely on her own terms …. Holding the power of it all in her own hands”. - that’s the “portraying a strong feministic figure”, isn’t it?

4. In the end, Monique’s book is about how complex Evelyn Hugo was and how great her love to Celia was ????

“And that is this: Evelyn Hugo was bisexual …..  she wanted you to know that because she loved Celia …. Because loving Celia St. James was perhaps her greatest political act” - I saw no love, hun. She loved only herself through the whole story.

“…. Because over the course of her life, she became aware of her responsibilities to others in the LGBTQ+ community to be visible, to be seen” -  Did I miss that part where she becomes aware??? No, she was just dying, didn’t care, and was actually living in the century where being gay is safe and fine!

“Doesn’t it bother you? That your husbands have become a headline story?”…. And her answer was quintessential Evelyn. “No”, she told me. “Because they are just husbands. I am Evelyn Hugo. And anyway, I think once people know the truth, they will be much more interested in my wife” - the author is trying hard to make me sympathize with Evelyn and make me see her as a strong but complicated woman, who had a heartbreaking love story.","lqfn7wg"

Maybe Hollywood saw her as Mexican but she wasn’t. Also this is Hollywood in the 40s. Of course they don’t bother to acknowledge her true ethnic group and just label her from a completely different ethnic group that they’re more familiar with. Thats problematic on its own.

What I’m getting at is that Rita Hayworth wasn’t Latina and I’m still puzzled on why she’s still labeled that way. Gitano and Cuban are very different despite obvious Spanish influence. Hope this makes sense.","lqj2r4v"

She herself was a flamenco dancer named Margarita Cansino. I feel like you’re operating in bad faith by pretending not to understand why racists 80 years ago would label her Hispanic, but in any case it’s not my job to convince you of the reasons behind other people’s bigotry. ","lqj9jhs"
