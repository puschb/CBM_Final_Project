“***Sunset Towers***

*The sun sets in the west (just about everyone knows that), but Sunset Towers faced east. Strange!*

*Sunset Towers faced east and had no towers. This glittery, glassy apartment house stood alone on the Lake Michigan shore five stories high. Five empty stories high.*

*Then one day (it happened to be the Fourth of July), a most uncommon-looking delivery boy rode around town slipping letters under the doors of the chosen tenants-to-be. The letters were signed ***Barney Northrup***.*

*The delivery boy was sixty-two years old, and there was no such person as Barney Northrup.*”

While it's been so for years, I still can't believe how *often* things pop up that (at least I) that sends me back to Finnegans Wake.  
  
Some examples of FW popping up:  
\\* Doing Laundry: Coming across a really dirty shirt (e.g. yardwork) I recall Book I episode 8 (Look at the shirt of him!Look at the dirt of it! He has all my water black on me!).  
\\* I have a family member, no kidding, take the stance of canned food being just as good as fresh--they've never read Finnegans Wake. I call them ""Shem"" in honor of Book I episode 6, who claims that canned food is better than any fresh bits: ""he repeated in his botulism that no junglegrown pineapple ever smacked like the whoppers you shook out of Ananias' cans"".  
\\* With mathematics as my profession: When drawing/plotting-data and analyzing it, I still laugh at the Naughtly Lesson of Book II episode 2, where one brother (shem-joyce) under the guise of Geometry, teaches his other brother (shaun-stanislaus) of their mother's naughty-bits.  
\\* During struggles: I sometimes think of the section of ""last page"" (and a bit previous), where the stage is set to renew; ""Two more. Onetwo moremens more. So. Avelaval. My leaves have drifted from me. All. But one clings still. I'll bear it on me. To remind me of. Lff! So soft this morning, ours...""  
\\* I'm reading Lord Jim, and I become a gigglepuss because I kept thinking of Book II episode 3 (The Norwegian Captain and the Tailor's Daughter ""Kerese the Taylor""): ""sagd/sayd/sazd"" as Lord Jim begins ""somewhat"" like a ships husband (well, Jim's a water-clerk but I still associated it).  
\\* I can't frikin stand Mooske and Gripes (Question 11 in Book I episode 6) because I was in academia for so long, and the professor's mental gymnastics of why he would not help (his brother?) who hurts reminds me too much of the pretentious garbage I had to deal with among colleagues and administration.  
\\* I will state, when holding my pint and call out: Why do I am alook alike a poss of porter peas?  
\\* Thunder and Lightening have never been the same (see ""thunderwords"" like     Perkodhuskurunbarggruauyagokgorlayorgromgremmitghundhurthrumathunaradidillifaititillibumullunukkunun!).  
\\* Many many more; the amount of specific words and tales is just outrageous.

Why did I pick this book up: I was getting a physical copy of Ulysses and saw this next; cracking it open I could not stop laughing; the eff is this! I thought; the eff am I looking at!? Truly it intrigued me. Learning how many years Joyce spent on the work-in-progress (about 17 years), and developing a tremendous appreciation of his works, I thought there must be something here (FW). I was right, at least for me, and my world is better :) 

Recommendation: If you pick it up, even to read one bit, start with page 627 with ""Yes, you're changing"" and read through the last page (628) then peek at the first line (page 3). And the gap before ""PARIS,1922-1939."" on page 628 is supposed to be there :)",""

"lq0sdq4","ohslapmesillysidney","2024-10-02 19:09:21 UTC","I agree - it’s such a vivid and oddly comforting book. The setting and plot are both quite unsettling IMO, but Piranesi is such a lovely character and seeing the House and world through his eyes makes for such a pleasurable read. Being stuck in an infinite labyrinth is objectively terrifying, but Piranesi’s affection for the House draws me to want to explore it myself. I once heard someone describe it as “an ode to the backrooms” and I think that’s such an accurate description! 

I think that a video game adaption would be super cool! Part of me would love to see it made into a movie, because I think that there’s room for the plot to be fleshed out more on film. But I also think that one of the charms of the book is that everyone imagines the House differently. Clarke did a great job at providing us with vivid descriptions of the House’s atmosphere, while also leaving enough open for our imaginations to fill in the gaps. 

It’s just such an absolute masterpiece.","lq0q4iw"
