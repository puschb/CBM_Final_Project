"lv6ug29","Beiez","2024-11-03 15:25:03 UTC","The term Magical Realism (_lo real maravilloso_), as coined by Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier, used to refer to a specific literary mode in which the (real or seemingly) supernatural was brought into the mundane in a way that didn‘t let it stand out. The supernatural isn’t something important to the plot, it isn‘t something that can be utilised by the characters. It‘s just another vagary of life.  

Today, Magical Realism has lost most of its original meaning. It‘s used to refer to anything and everything that‘s sorta realistic but also has supernatural elements. South American authors especially are often wrongly placed in that category just because the genre‘s origins lay there (looking at you Borges).  

For someone who‘s a fan of the og kind of magical realism, that makes it incredibly frustrating to try and find new magical realism authors and books.",""
"lv6ti9z","Otherwise-Emu-2963","2024-11-03 15:19:56 UTC","From what I've always been taught, magical realism is a work that takes extraordinary circumstances, but treats them as normal in a realistic setting. For example, let's say there's a book about a mundane small town where humans can understand animals. If this book is magical realism, then that trait would be represented without explanation. A character could be walking down the street, overhear a dog's thoughts and just go to the grocery store. The origin of this phenomenon is not explained or recognized as ""different"" or ""special."" It just is. Now, if this same book was a fantasy or sci-fi book, there would probably be a lot of exposition to explain why humans can suddenly understand animals, usually relating to some curse, order, or in the case of dystopian novels, a catastrophic event that forever changed the way our society works. It can be confusing to truly define the genre, but I hope this helps in some way!",""

Babel isn't magical realism.  Its historical fantasy - the setting is very much not our ""real"" world.    
  
Genres are of course flexible but based on what I've read about Babel (which I've not personally read) it isn't trying to do what magical realism does as a genre (which is more about show the subjectivity of reality and the ""magic"" of the everyday/ordinary).

Here's a dirty little secret: Genres have no definitions, and no clearly delineated borders. They are clusters of books, styles, authors or story elements that readers have come to associate with one another, and which are put into a distinct label by marketing experts in order to have a delineated target market they can sell a particular set of books to. Because this creates a space with inherently fuzzy borders which is based almost entirely on which books *feel* like they share certain things, genres are almost entirely vibes based.",""

There are 3 primary ways of looking at the world and understanding it - magic, religion, science. One of the main characteristics of magical outlook is its lack of division between sacrum and profanum. 

You can see it in a lot of folklore around the world - the devil pissing in your milk to make it sour is just another Saturday, but the people coming into the village with the moving pictures machine are something strange and weird.

She lives in our world, but her reality is about being told by a prophet that Trump was going to win; that my sister’s inability to find a job is because an envious cousin did witchcraft on her; that a goblin that made sounds lived in the backyard of my childhood home, and she even purportedly saw it once; or that she saw the shadow of the spirit of her grandmother standing at the feet of her bed once in the middle of the night, and that her grandmother gave her a warning. To her, all these things are not so much magical as they are *real*, despite arguably having an explanation.

Now, you may say that is superstition. Yes, but magical realism is describing a story from her perspective, a window into her fantastical reality right here in our world. Magical realism is that she lives in our world but things that happen are magical, even though we’re sharing the same physical reality, which is not magical for me. Magical realism is that liminal space where my doubts reside, the ambivalence of my wondering whether my mother may actually be right.

Same author, different book: *The Satanic Verses*. The racism of British society towards immigrants in the 80s is refracted through the lens of magic realism, as one of the main characters (who ironically copies everything the British do down to their mannerisms and speech) transforms into a goat-like monster.

There are some gray areas of course, Harry Potter is 100% fantasy even though the magic is hidden in a world of muggles. But because the wizarding world is so widespread, and the story takes place mostly in a magical school, it reads as a fantasy.

Unlike fantasy and science fiction it's not just an absurd adventure, but the unrealistic elements have a deeper, symbolic meaning. There can be dreamlike sequences that reveal subconscious wishes or fears. These writers are often influenced by philosophers and. psychologists like Freud, Jung, Plato etc. Ancient myths and legends can be an inspiration, as can sacred books.

I just want to add that the genre, especially in Spanish literature, is considered to have emerged from the interplay between Latin American folk traditions and a more urbanized, modernized, westernized perspective.

I thought it was great. Read it the same week as *The Shadow Catcher* by Marianne Wiggins, who was one of Salman Rushdie's 47 ex-wives but is known, in North America at least, as a very talented novelist in her own right. I'd personally rather read her stuff than Rushdie's. Never been crazy about Rushdie, whose *Midnight's Children* falls into the magical realism genre, even if I don't love the book or the writer's plodding style.

I do think it is kind of eerie that his novel *Fury*, which I read and did not really enjoy, but which came out a week and a half before 9/11, has a front cover that seems to predict the imminent violence. I know it's not the Twin Towers, but the gathering storm above Manhattan's skyline is unmistakably menacing. We can't post images in this sub but you can see the front cover I mean on the novel's [Wikipedia page. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fury_(Rushdie_novel))

Similarly, the front cover of Don DeLillo's *Underworld* [features a low-angle shot of one of two Twin Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld_(novel)) rising into a cloud of smog or fog, almost as if the top half of the tower is missing. This is also kinda creepy, I think.

Finally, the front cover of the paperback edition of Thomas Pynchon's *Against the Day* is a reference to line in the novel, where a man is standing on the precipice of a tall building, a la Adam Driver trembling on the lip of a tall tower in *Megalopolis*, musing about ""*asserting his reality against them all in one last roaring plunge from rooftop to street.*""

Although those poor souls trapped in the Twin Towers were not ""asserting"" anything, I think the phrase and the accompanying cover is meant to convey the terror of the sheer velocity you would be greeted with upon making that ""one last roaring plunge.""

Anyway, I've gone off-topic, as usual. Gabriel García Márquez's *One Hundred Years of Solitude* and *Love in the Time of Cholera* are both incredible examples of magical realism. Toni Morrison's *Beloved* has been called magical realism but I'm not sure about that. I'm better at reading books than categorizing them. Italo Calvino's *Invisible Cities* has been called magical realism and post-modern. I think it's both. And also a bunch of other things.

It does seem to be the case that novels by non-white non-Americans are given the ""magical realism"" tag when similar books by white Americans or Canadians or English writers are ""post-modern."" There are differences between the two genres but post-modern novels always have a bunch of inexplicable shit going on, spirits communicating with people, a whole group of cyclists suddenly vanishing from a race (Steve Erickson's *Days Between Stations*), hollow earths where fairies prance and whisper lyrical poetry.

It can def seem like, depending on where you're writing from pre-decides whether your book will be categorized as ""magical realism"" or ""post-modern.""",""

"lv7gju4","UnaRansom","2024-11-03 17:17:21 UTC","In order for magical realism to register as a (sub-) genre or style, there need to be books that fall outside it: novels like Portrait of a Lady, Disgrace, The Echoing Grove are devoid of fantasy, magic, and paranormal elements. I don’t think they register on a magical realism spectrum — except, perhaps, at the pole end, if we so define this spectrum. 


 That aside, I very much follow your general line of thinking. Some novels are called magical realism and are found in the literary section of bookstores because the magical elements are woven into a well-layered unity of form that develops depth, themes, and an eye to literary form. Whereas a classical sci-fi or fantasy novel (Pohl, Aldiss, Niven) maybe centre more of the novel’s gravity on world building, technology, or dragons.


 Ultimately, genre markers are arbitrary to the extent they are socially constructed labels. Why, after all, is there a crime/detective genre, but not, say, a curiosity or career genre? 


Same with horror: that’s a (sub-)genre (for some), but I’ve yet to hear of a sublime genre, or a bewilderment genre. 

 It’s because of the socially constructive nature of genres, that we’re left with a space that is both very wide and very narrow. 

 Wide: because genres usually have criteria, which we can then use to make counter-intuitive claims that run against the social grain. We can, for example, claim that 1984 belongs in sci-fi sections or Crime and Punishment should be shelved next to Peter Donoghue’s Ancient Egypt crime stories.  

 Narrow: but the criteria for genres seems to come up *after* a salient part of the reading world has clustered together certain novels/authors into a category. But those things are often held together by the naturally inconsistent nature of vibe and group affect. So that even though one could make the argument that X 18th century work falls under “dark academia”, one is neglecting the fact that often times such genre labels say more about the shared group identity of the people who use it, rather than the books and their merits themselves.",""

I've read a few books that were described as magical realism, The Cartographers by Peng Shepard, A History of Wild Places by Shea Ernshaw, and The Lost Apothecary by Sarah Penner.  In all 3, the magic was such a small part of the story and had almost next to nothing to do with the plot.",""

Everything supernatural is fantasy. Magical realism is a sub-category under the umbrella of fantasy.      

> But that’s why I want to know, when does a book leave the sci-fi and fantasy realm and become magical realism? 

A lot of sci-fi is fantasy too. Like Star Wars. It's got ""the force"" which is basically just magic. And the same can be said about X-Men and other superheroes.        
I wouldn't say that sci-fi is also a sub-category under the umbrella of fantasy, but rather an umbrella, a ""main category"" of its own, that often overlaps. But magical realism is definitely a sub-category of fantasy. It even has ""magic"" i the name. 

I view magical realism as ""fantasy set in the real world"". So, The Dresden Files would be a good example. It's a series about a wizard existing in the real world, in a real city. I'd say a lot of vampire fiction is also magical realism because it's set in the real world, but have (often secretly) magical being existing along side a world that's ignorant to this fact.

"lv9gcjr","KristinnK","2024-11-03 23:23:27 UTC","Exactly. Recently lots of YA fantasy books for some reason have been called magical realism for literally no reason at all. Even the Disney animated fantasy film, Encanto, was marketed as magical realism. Magical realism is more than anything realism. I.e. literary fiction that deals with honest evaluation of real world societies. Think Dostoyevsky, Pasternak, Steinbeck. The only difference is it adds supernatural elements for thematic effect, to heighten the atmosphere, or to emphasize contradictions or absurdities, which are rarely affected, wielded, or often even acknowledged by characters. As an example, in 100 Years when the patriarch succumbs to madness and it tied to a tree and just lives there for literally decades, this is never addressed or even acknowledged as unusual by other characters. This is just how their world is. Whereas in fantasy supernatural elements are plot devices, and active elements in characters actions and motivations, considered by all characters that encounter them. I'd even go so far as to say that magical realism is about as far separated from YA fantasy as any two genres can be.

As for books that are actually magical realism, Beauty is a Wound by Eka Kurniawan is an absolutely wonderful book about Indonesia during and post WWII, very much in the tradition of 100 Years. I would put it as an absolute much-read for any magical realism fan.

I would also welcome recommendations by anyone within the genre, as searches for good examples mostly yield either the obvious examples of Marquez/Calvino/Rushdie/Allende (the last of which I did not enjoy much at all by the way), or the aforementioned YA fantasy in (barely any) disguise.","lv6ug29"

"lv7w3lb","10Panoptica","2024-11-03 18:33:52 UTC","This is also my understanding. I know a big influence in conversations around it was Chicano author/professor Luis Leal, and he made a big point of distinguishing works with fantastical elements by how they relate those to reality.

Fantasy creates an alternate reality, an escape from reality. Even in contemporary settings like Harry Potter and Dresden Files, it's not our world, it's ""a world like ours, but with magic!""

Surrealism, which is where I'd place Kafka, depicts regular reality with impossibly weird things added, *but* the impossible things are intrusions into our reality, not part of it. They jar readers & characters, essentially *breaking* reality as we know it. ""What if a guy woke and was a bug?""

In Magical Realism, the setting is our reality, because it's realism, and the magical elements are a normal part of it. You can see this in A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings, or The Handsomest Drowned Man in the world. They're not symbols or metaphors or speculations, they're just a mundane part of the mystery that is life.

  
I think this is obviously a simplification, and there's lots of valid perspectives. And I think ideas have certainly evolved since Leal wrote in the late 60s. There's a great essay collection called ""Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community"" that deals with some (although IIRC it's from the 90s, so I'm sure there's newer writing since).","lv6ti9z"
"lv73g21","BindaBoogaloo","2024-11-03 16:11:21 UTC","The way I was taught is that unusual phenomena are integrated into the everyday and taken for granted as normal.


Like that scene in Looper where people were first developing telekinesis and other psychic powers and the guy who levitates the coin didnt think it was that much of a big deal, and it took place against a backdrop of a lot of people developing psychic powers but it was an everyday oxcurrenxe and people just kinda integrated it into their normal lives.


The difference between magical realism and fantasy, therefore is that our real and otherwise mundane universe stays the same and these little elements of the magical and unusual are integrated into that mundane world like how we integrate new technology and just kinda take it for granted after the novelty wears off.


Another ezample my lit prof used is a scene from this short story where when people died their bodies turned into moths and everyone just accepted of course thats what happens when you die like how we accept rainbows or that birds can fly. 


The overarching mundane world we as readers know and live in remains the same with these little bits of the unusual accepted as normal and therefoee unremarkable.


In fantasy the whole universe tends to be changed and completely different from our planet earth.


Lit pro also shared Naked Lunch as an example of magical realism.


The movie Bright has elements of classic fantasy and is edging towards magical realism, and that movie Project Power I'd describe more as leaning towards science fiction because the central plot device was created in a laboratory, same with the movie Push.


I'm trying to think of a movie I've seen that could be said to belong to the magical realism genre but most of the ones I can think of are definitely sci fi or fantasy.

Honestly, I tend to see it more in film than I do books, but I'd *love* to find more books with the same sort of premise.

As far as films, ones that come immediately to mind are Timer and The Invention of Lying. Timer is literally ""The real world, but everyone can get a countdown clock installed on them that tells them when they'll meet their soulmate"", and the narrative follows a woman who apparently won't meet hers until she's 60-something, but meets someone who she starts falling for. It's a story that revolves around this completely unrealistic premise, but the story itself is functionally mundane and only partially informed by this ""magical"" aspect. Invention of Lying showcases a world where the ability to be dishonest doesn't exist, so everything and everybody is very matter of fact and blunt, until one man evolves the ability to ""say something that wasn't"", and how the introduction of untruths affects a world of people who will believe anything that's said without question.

These kinds of stories are fascinating to me in print and on the screen, but so many veer into Urban Fantasy like Dresden Files, or even Harry Potter to an extent. The stories inevitably take a turn for the ""epic"" and having to save the world from certain doom. Magical Realism, on the other hand, takes the normal world, makes it ever so slightly magical, and tells us a comfy story about real people dealing with things that are decidedly *abnormal* to us, but are completely normal to them. It draws you in with the unusual premise and makes you stay for the whimsy of the local retail worker having to chase pixies out of the cereal aisle.","lv6ti9z"

~~~

*Babel* doesn't qualify as magical realism. Everyone in the book acknowledges the magic, people and society react to it realistically, and the plot proceeds in a manner that makes sense. It's for sure a fantasy- historical fantasy, alternate history, whatever you want to call it.

~~~

I'd say *The Metamorphosis* is almost magical realism. It has many qualifications: The setting has an internal consistency nearly identical to the real world. The magic violates that internal consistency. The magic is unexplained.

The reason it's only ""almost"" is that everyone reacts to the transformation in mostly believable, if perhaps unusual, ways.

I haven't read *Before the Coffee Gets Cold*. Based on what I see on wikipedia, I'd say it isn't magical realism.

As an example, I recently read a short story about a young woman becoming uncomfortable with various parts of her body in turn, and each time that occurred, she would remove that body part and bury it in a hole in the backyard. That magical aspect was very nonchalant and logically irrelevant (as opposed to fantasy or even surrealism), but from the perspective of craft it was very utilitarian in that it was the main vehicle for communicating the theme of the story. I hope my rambling makes sense!","lv7w3lb"
"lv8avk8","Brad_Brace","2024-11-03 19:48:06 UTC","One of my favorite examples is from The Autumn of the Patriarch, when it's mentioned that the dictator sold the nation's ocean to the Americans. Now, reading that you'd understood it first as he sold the rights to use the territorial ocean to the US. But it's implied the literal ocean was taken away and what was left was just large expanses of salt. But at the same time there are no catastrophic consequences like there would be if someone you took an ocean away.  

Examples like that make me think an important part of magical realism is that a piece of information is given about an event really happening, but which could be explained away as a misunderstanding, fancy, or poetic language. Like maybe the dictator in The Autumn of the Patriarch just sold the rights to the territorial ocean, but as time went on and after his death, people told it like he had actually sold them literal ocean. It's the way legends could be built, where a warrior defeats an enemy and a hundred years later he's said to have laid siege to entire enemy hordes and to have been a giant. But the narrative doesn't care if it was one way or the other, the fact is offered as is. Alternatively, as a reader you witness the magical event happening, but if you put yourself in the shoes of someone just hearing about it, you can also understand how they could explain it away as non-magical.  

The way I see it:  

Fantasy: And then Mariella, in anger, cast a fireball at her husband, burning him to a crisp.  

Magical realism: And so Mariella burned her husband with the intensity of her anger.  

And in both cases the husband is burned to death, but the second could be explained away as a figure of speech, or like it's poetically leaving out how she got him drunk, dosed him in gasoline and lit a match. Even though the actual event as depicted in the texts is that she burned him directly with her anger. Also, both cases may contain a lesson, don't make your wife too angry, but one of them requires the wife to have some specific power, and a normal woman would not be able to do it. In the other case any woman could do it under the right, or wrong, circumstances.","lv73g21"

Society is completely the same but there are witches, but usually they are considered outside the norm and discriminated against. Is this magical realism or is it fantasy because people don’t necessarily take it as ordinary?

"lva1chl","RudeHero","2024-11-04 01:23:05 UTC","> The way I was taught is that unusual phenomena are integrated into the everyday and taken for granted as normal.

The way I was taught was a little different. The one change is that magical realism requires internal inconsistency, or unacknowledged incongruence.

In my understanding, the unusual phenomena *aren't* integrated into society in the same way as technology. An integral component is that people explicitly *do not* react to it in ways that make sense within the setting.

> Like that scene in Looper where people were first developing telekinesis and other psychic powers and the guy who levitates the coin didnt think it was that much of a big deal, and it took place against a backdrop of a lot of people developing psychic powers but it was an everyday oxcurrenxe and people just kinda integrated it into their normal lives.

In the setting of Looper, people start developing psychic powers. People are shocked at first. It's seriously investigated by governments, corporations, etc until the telekinesis is determined to be weak, useless, and unhelpful to science. If I remember correctly, this is explained by Bruce Willis' character in a voice-over.

If weak telekinesis appeared in the real world, these would be reasonable ways to react. That makes it not magical realism. It's a believable soft sci-fi or fantasy element.

Magical realism would be if, in Looper's setting, one day the first person suddenly had telekinesis, and literally nobody cared. Bonus points if this isn't explained to the reader, either.

Magical realism might also be if the guy levitated the coin, nobody acknowledged it, there was no voice-over or supplemental material explaining it, and levitation never appeared in the film again.

That would add the critical component of internal inconsistency or unacknowledged incongruence.","lv73g21"

I read this one story when I was a kid. It was a short story and it appeared in a sci-fi anthology.


It was a story that took place on a water planet other than earth. This planet had abundant oceans and almost no land.


There was a specific kind of fish that lived in the oceans, it was very valuable to the people who fished there. 


The fish were extremely numerous, in the trillions, but because the fish only spawned under specific conditions their life cycle had them reach harvestable maturation every ten years or so.


They were also extremely hard to catch, and any that were caught were almost always unusable. The corporations tried to raise the ones they could catch in captivity to breed their own supply of the fish, but they all died.


It was so valuable that corporations spent a lot of money to create massive fishing ships that flew over the oceans with the most advanced detection equipment in order to increase their catches. But the ships, for all their technology, failed to catch more than small, small numbers of the fish.


There was one fisherman who sailed in every 10 year cycle to fish. He had a small scruffy boat and was the only crew. He used only an old fashioned net to fish and every time he went out he caught hundreds of the fish representing a fortune with each haul.


In the story it is revealed that the fish willingly go to the man's nets because he honors them with an offering, he lives a humble life and he keeps none of the wealth of this fish for himself.","lv8avk8"

Are witches secret and have to hide their powers? In this case no not magical realism.


A key characteristic of magical realism is that is ubiquitous and everyone knows about The Thing, they just aren't focused on it as special or different.  


So, our actual world we live in right now with cars and computers and rainbows and birds and republicans and democrats and climate change and the oceanic garbage patch and cycling interregional portals and bologna sandwiches and soda and atheletes foot and hemorrhoids and .... It's like that.


It's just part of the world like using the bathroom or riding a ski jet or flying in a plane.


And because it is integrated into the world like that it is not a plot device, it is texture.


A witch's power is, conventionally, a plot device around which the story revolves.

Magical realism, by contrast, tends to be simultaneously mundane *and* out-of-the-blue.

Magical events are not frequent in magical realism; they appear in a few places, maybe only once, to underline a theme or point that the author is making. Nobody ever anticipates a magical event.

In contrast they're ever-present in fantasy, implied or anticipated if not actually happening.","lv79exy"

Literary fiction does not follow conventions like that, meaning that it functions differently. I have not implied that one is better than the other.","lv8buua"
"lv7ho0o","Hopeful_Meeting_7248","2024-11-03 17:22:48 UTC","I read one brilliant book that mixed magical realism with fantasy. The author was seamlessly jumping between the genres.","lv7eojy"
"lv8e5ii","Hopeful_Meeting_7248","2024-11-03 20:04:43 UTC","I guess it depends. I read One Hundred Years of Solitude 14 years ago so I don't remember it very well but I think it was pretty ""magical"". The Autumn of the Patriarch not so much.

But you also find fantasy that's very low on supernatural elements like A Game of Thrones or books by K. J. Parker.","lv8btyh"
"lv8er4c","Eegeria","2024-11-03 20:07:47 UTC","Hey, I know what you mean, but breathe and calm down. I don't disagree with you, but I was making a wider point on the difference between a genre and a style of fiction that both happen to feature ""magic"" but in vastly different ways. Hope that point came across, if it didn't, you can find more comprehensive answers around the thread. Bye!","lv8dgex"
