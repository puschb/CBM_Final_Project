Saunders takes 7 short stories by Russian writers and dissects them (both for the reader and the writer). He does this with compassion and a Pollyannaish exuberance for the material - to the point where he advocates for the artform’s ability to transform the way we live.

I read his Substack and wish I could go back in time and take his classes at Syracuse before I became a corporate working wonk. 

That said I didn’t care for Lincoln and about half of his shorts fall flat for me but the ones I like, I really like.",""

"luez9vd","Decent-Decent","2024-10-29 21:13:22 UTC","I think he’s one of our best living American writers. His control of voice and character is incredible and he balances darkness with humor across his catalog. He understands human beings and how people talk in such a unique fun way. He also has such a way of encapsulating our moment by writing corporate dystopias populated by mostly well-meaning but badly behaving people. He also understands how incentives and structures lead to dystopian outcomes in a lot of his sci-fi/speculative work. He’s also just really fucking funny. In some ways he reminds me of Raymond Carver and Kurt Vonnegut if they were more twisted. He’s not an author that I would recommend to anyone but the people who get him really get him imo. 

Tenth of December, Liberation Day, and Pastoralia are his best works imo. People who have only read Lincoln in the Bardo probably don’t have a clear picture of his body of work. 

Some short story recommendations off the top of my head: Puppy, Ghoul, 400 Pound CEO, Liberation Day, The Semplica-Girl Diaries, Escape from Spiderhead",""
"luesciv","precisionjason","2024-10-29 20:38:51 UTC","I think you're absolutely right. That was a great deal of what I learned from him when I studied with him at Syracuse.

I'd also throw out ""radical openness"" and ""child mind"" from various Eastern philosophies. Underneath his humor, or maybe intertwined with it, is a curiosity about the perspective of the other that leads to some common ground between characters or between characters and reader. The discovery of some form of ""we"" through reading.",""

"luezj3e","Fabulous-Wolf-4401","2024-10-29 21:14:41 UTC","I love George Saunders. The first book of his I read, over 20 years ago, was a book of short stories called 'Pastoralia'. I'd never heard of him, I bought it for 2 reasons, the cover art, and the quote from someone I can't remember saying 'George Saunders for President!' I read the book, and the story 'Sea Oak' stays with me. I re-read this book. Since then, I've bought everything he has written. I agree with you, kindness is a choice, should really be the only choice, and can be a really powerful weapon (think of Gandhi and his non-violence stance). It makes you, the one turning the other cheek, the more morally powerful one, regardless of the outcome - if you're perceived as weak, it doesn't matter to you, bacause you know you are right. Self-righteousness much? That's the dichotomy right there, you're better than 'them' even if they beat you. In your mind, you've got the upper hand, even if it gets you nowhere. I think he is truly subversive. He's also the only author, that I've read, who genuinely seems to empathise with everyone in whatever situation they are in, and is compassionate. In a way he reminds me of David Sedaris, who also explores his own moral failures in a similarly truthful way.",""

been a few years since i've read anything of his, but i remember him as a very daring and accomplished writer of some extremely unorthodox fiction. there is a timeless quality to some of his short stories.

However, I then read “The Brain-Dead Megaphone”, his essay collection, and really liked both his ideas and style. The title piece, which opens the book, was published in 2008, but perfectly predicts Donald Trump. It makes clear, in retrospect, that he is not an aberration but the logical outcome of our profit-seeking society, which monetizes even needs. He goes on to explain (better than I am) that this deadens our ability to think critically, even to think independently, as we, instead, begin responding to the megaphone in the room. He also writes lovingly about Kurt Vonnegut and other topics. I recommend this volume.

i don't think there's anything simple about suburban angst, which also includes illness, death and bankruptcy, both moral and financial. these are the human problems.","lufdtqc"

u seem to be one of the few (on this thread) who enjoyed Lincoln. i'm not much into civil war stuff, so while i'll probably get to it eventually, i'll likely not be reading it any time soon.

i think i'm going to read the brain dead megaphone next.","lueyymw"
"luezwjp","outofthisworld_umkay","2024-10-29 21:16:35 UTC","Liberation Day and Tenth of December are both much more fully developed collections than Civilwarland in Bad Decline. Liberation Day has some beautiful stories regarding Trumpism.","luewmbp"
"luztepy","quantcompandthings","2024-11-02 09:45:00 UTC","u've sold me on the brain-dead megaphone as my next saunders book. i'm reading the short story collection Tenth of December right now, and it's pretty amazing so far. 

""I didn’t care about the characters, who had sordid pasts and hopeless futures. I quit before reading the novella that ends the book.""

that's like quite a few of the stories in Tenth of December. Escape From Spiderhead takes that to the next level though wrt sordid pasts and hopeless (or more like zero) futures. very powerful story regardless, it broke my mind. 

given his reputation i was expecting a lot of soppy self help stuff and clean respectable james thurber-ish humor. but instead i got so much pain and sadness, and so so funny, like gallows humor kind of funny. his stories are very cathartic, for me.","luewmbp"

"lueut1z","Himajinga","2024-10-29 20:50:59 UTC","Funny story, my wife and I both read it when it first came out and really loved it, thought it was very affecting and beautiful, and maybe one of the best books we’d read in years (though we read Sigrid Nunez’s the Friend the same year so it was a good year for us). We recommended it to her mom who then picked it for her book club, and literally everybody in the book club could not finish it because they hated it so much. They’ve never quit a book before or since. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

My favorite book is Moby Dick, so I have a fairly high tolerance for digressive writing I guess","luer3pv"
"lune9mq","DavidHJ","2024-10-31 04:44:20 UTC","I remember buying that book at a local bookstore never having heard of Saunders because I read Victory Lap standing in the aisle and needed to keep reading. I sat down in the bookstore's cafe and started reading, ended up calling off a work shift and just plowing through the whole thing in one afternoon. I barely remember any of the stories now, I haven't read any of them again since that day, but I felt like I experienced the entire range of human emotion that day, and I certainly remember that.

I should really read that book again.","luf0d7r"

After I first read it, I made a friend of mine read it, even though we were in a bar having a drink after work. It's hilarious and tragic and thought-provoking and disheartening and so prescient. It's one of my all-time favourite pieces of literature. I think it's shaped how I react to other writing since I first read it.","luf79n7"

The audio was incredibly well done though and had an amazing cast. It was a bit hard to keep track of everybody at times, but it didn't affect my enjoyment or understanding of it (I think) I loved it so much that after I finished I pulled it off our shelf and flipped through it, just to see how it was formatted on the page! I'd love to read/listen to it again, maybe following along the book while listening to the audio!","luft9e1"
