At least once you get out of elementary school and the kids shows.  It all is individualized and to an extent what their immediate friends are into.  For example music.  It used to be a huge part of the youth identity.  Now a lot of kids don’t listen to music at all except as background on videos or in shows.  The ones that do have access to the entirety of recorded music.  So my kid listens to everything from Frank Sinatra to Eminem to Tyler the creator to the Smiths to GnR to weird ambient stuff that has 35000 listens on Spotify.  His closest friends share a playlist that they will play when they are gaming.  You talk with some of his other friends and they wouldn’t know any of the bands listed except like I said from Tik Tok or movies/tv shows.  Same with older tv my kids know Friends because they have heard their mom and I talk about it.   So at a certain level writing a teen you could put in any TV show reference as streamed and it might make sense for a character just not all the characters.  Slang might be a bit more universal but it is coming from the same social media source and changes at the pace of social media.  You would almost be as good  making something up as temporal to the time and place of the story than trying to use something real which would feel more dated.

But King has been writing very poignantly about aging, the melancholy aspects of aging since From A Buick 8. Revival had some great ""there are no more pretty ladies at my door"" introspection from Jamie Morton. And his newer one? You Like It Darker? The Answer Man is heartbreaking. And the story that continues Vic from Cujo's arc (Rattlesnakes) has the following gut-punch line: 


She walked away without looking back. Reagan was president. We thought we were old but we didn't know what old was.


Or this one from The Fifth Step: 


At sixty-eight he liked to believe he had a fair amount of road left, but there was no denying it had begun to narrow.


I think King also writes about marriage really well. Cujo, Pet Sematary, The Dark Half, Dolores Claiborne, Gerald's Game (a major turning point for King, I think. He's been writing better and better ever since this novel with a few lapses...Needful Things has a really dumb ending) and Lisey's Story. I know King hates Rose Madder, and it is overly long, but its depiction of an abusive marriage is spot-on, I think. 


I'm more tired of King having protagonists who are writers. I remember opening Bag of Bones with a sigh. ""Again? AGAIN? Another goddamn writer protagonist? Why couldn't he just STOP this shit after Secret Window, Secret Garden?"" 


Some of King's early work is fun to read. He really draws you into a story. But the whole ""hand of God"" scene in The Stand is ridiculous. I hope he would never write something like that now. And I actually think Firestarter is a much stronger book than Carrie. The opposite is true for the film adaptations tho. 


Write what you know. King nailed a very specific kind of 50s greaser high school vibe in Christine even though it was supposed to be set in the 70s. So it only makes sense that, as he ages, his kid characters become less believable. Abra from Dr Sleep is awkwardly rendered. Even Jack Sawyer in The Talisman (one of King's worst books) is more believable. I also think King NAILED the 60s campus vibe in the title story of Hearts in Atlantis. NO IDEA why the film adaptation adapted the story Low Men in Yellow Coats but called it Hearts in Atlantis.""Like...would they have titled Apt Pupil...The Breathing Method? 


Anyway, King went to college and I think his campus novella holds up with other great campus novels like The Art of Fielding, The Marriage Plot, The Rule of Four, Stoner, and The Secret History. 


But yeah, he hasn't been a kid in over half a century and his own children are fully grown. Stands to reason he's way out touch. His eBook he wrote for Jeff Bezos, Ur, wasn't worth a damn IMO either. But Holly is likeable as hell. As is Bill Hodges. 


Then again, King always writes old guys sympathetically. Jud in Pet Sematary, The Grandfather in the Tommyknockers (forgot his name), Ted in Low Men In Yellow Coats. Of course, then there's Roland D LeBay, who is just a shitter. 


ANYWAY, I agree with your observation 100%. He can't write about kids or teens believably anymore. And his use of brand names and slang sometimes feels just as forced and silly as blatant product placement in films. 


There's a line in From A Buick 8 about ""whatever the kids are listening to these days. Wilco."" I mean...I like Wilco but were they really THAT big in 2002? I'd say ""the kids"" were listening to Britney Spears, N Sync, J Lo, Jay-Z, Dr Dre, Eminem. Those who still into rock would probably like Wilco but 2002 was more of the heyday of the Strokes, Interpol, the White Stripes and Queens of the Stone Age. Nu metal was done by then, so thank God he didn't write ""Limp Bizkit."" I think my head would explode if I saw Limp Bizkit mentioned in a King novel.",""

However, I agree with you. I grew up reading outdated slang and then tried to use it. It went very well with my parents & grandparents, and very poorly with the other kids. In a way it makes sense, because King knows his audience is going to understand that kind of dialogue, so even if the kids aren't very convincing  in a real-world way, in the story they're characters, archetypes, stand-ins for phases of life.

They talked about politics, world tragedies, extended family drama (could’ve kept some of that closer to the vest) and more in front of us to an extent. We also watched a whole lot of “family” movies with difficult topics (y’know, the ones that are rated 1990’s PG or PG-13 and make you cry and where the dog dies or people die from cancer or whatever) but also a lot of…probably more completely inappropriate or “boring” movies (like Braveheart, The Pelican Brief, 12 Monkeys, Of Mice and Men, etc) for better or worse.

I feel like King has never grown as an author or taken a look at where culture is now vs when he started writing. If I didn't know better if think this wasn't published in 2009, but rather decades prior.

While it is an interesting psychological look into an adult Lord of the Flies kind of situation, most of it feels very cartoon-esque.the villains are obnoxiously evil. The good guys are incredibly incompetent and naive. And the kids sound so fake. Maybe the baby Little Walter was okay but only because he's clearly suffering from drug poisoning. Most of the kids sounded like they'd fit in on the cast of Stranger Things. Their language was all 80s or earlier.

Every so often King would bring up some new technology (which, if interviews are to believed, is the main thing that allowed him to publish this manuscript. He couldn't get the setting to work until smart phones were a thing) and describe it as though he was explaining it to an alien. His Apple TV description was hilarious.

Anyway, the amount of on page rape, necrophilia, suffering, torture, arson, etc all made me feel so icky by the end of this book. I think this story could have been told way better had we not had so many POVs from Junior or Big Jim. It would have been stronger if King wasn't writing it as well.",""

The fact he wrote that was appalling, the fact an editor didn't suggest removing it is mind boggling. It added nothing to the story except to question the character of the protagonist.

If you put skibidi toilet in a manuscript, by the time the book actually came out it would be wrong. Best way to do it is to stick to contemporary colloquial English and get some input on more stable colloquialisms. But some of the examples given like zapper -- a bunch of these stick around weirdly based on region or family. American English is less regionally specific than it used to be, but there's still differences. I'm from New York which definitely has some distinctive usage. 

King should just get the youth equivalent of a sensitivity reader. It's not like his books don't generate enough income to pay for it. Then you could avoid the obvious outliers like someone calling jeans ""dungarees"" which I haven't heard someone do since my grandmother. 

The bigger problem is pop culture references. Honestly, I feel like people my age (late GenX) were more likely to see decades old TV shows because we'd watch whatever happened to be on.

He's credited somebody (I think their name is Robin?) with handling/correcting some of the research elements he fell short on, but even the two of them combined fuck up sometimes. 

One research fuckup that I find kinda ironic is from *Fairy Tale*, because King has the protagonist research a (very real) drug enough to determine that another character is taking it to treat cancer, but then has the protag eliminate breast cancer as one of the possibilities because the person taking it was a man.","lv26ynu"

The first one was similar to The Martian and the characters' defining thing was being nerdy and making 80s-90s references about ten years too old for them. Which was fine because it was still a distinct character voice and some people are genuinely just like that. Then the next protagonist was a teen girl who made the same references. Then I think some kind of otherwise professional and serious FBI agent. Then a guy with amnesia who had conveniently forgotten everything except X-Files trivia.  


Which is all to say, giving characters your exact taste in references can work but it gets grating after a while, especially if it doesn't really fit in with the rest of their characterisation.

I love Stephen King and read him on repeat. But I have a fair number of complaints about his more recent work and most of them could have been fixed by a skilled, youthful editor.

It felt like a get out of jail card for not really being able to write an authentic black character.

A lot of King’s writing on race, sex, teenage life, and technology seems to be stuck in the 1950s. I think he has a grasp of what he doesn’t understand well enough to write realistically but sometimes I don’t think he realises that his experience isn’t applicable to everyone.

These tapes were cheap because it was 40's, 50's and 60's entertainment that came before modern restoration technology was really a thing. Companies would buy the rights (or not) or just collect stuff that was in the public domain, and make compilations that people would buy in value bins for their kids who they just wanted to entertain without spending a lot. It was like the internet without any organization algorithms or individual content. There were also syndicated shows and Cable TV, so they learned a lot from those, too.

15 years ago doesn't seem like a long time, but with technology and entertainment, it's like an entirely different epoch.

SPIN declared At the Drive-In the next Nirvana after Relationship of Command. ATDI broke up a few months later.

The atomization of culture has guaranteed there won't be a next Nirvana. Which is okay. I don't listen exclusively to guitar-based music like I used to. I like Washed Out and chillwave and vaporwave just as much as I loved QOTSA's Songs for the Deaf 22 years ago (I still think it's a landmark rock album and that band's very best. Rated R comes close but Deaf is their greatest.)

Seems to be the opposite with movies right now though. Weirdly, the only movies that get huge budgets are based on existing IP. Did we REALLY need a movie based on the fucking boardgame Battleship? Did that *really* need to exist? Who is gonna play the old robber baron with the monocle in the Monopoly movie? Anthony Hopkins? Christopher Plummer? An A.I. version of Donald Sutherland?

Or they could just NOT make that movie and instead of handing out a $400 million budget to make Batman XIV, they could give 20 different filmmakers $20 million and I would bet that at least three of those movies would be GREAT. Another ten would be good. The other ten would range from interesting/ambitious failures to unwatchable. But the culture would be richer for having had these 20 wildly disparate movies instead of YET ANOTHER fucking ""the joker was SO GOOD in this one.""

Of course the Joker was good. He is an entertaining character. Do we really need to see him redone ever 18 months? Heath Ledger already gave the definitive performance. Phoenix is fine but his performance was NOT superior to Ledger's. No one's will be. Jared Leto? As Joker? Ugh spare me.

ANYWAY, music is atomized except for the Weeknd/Taylor Swift types. There are no middle-tier acts anymore. Just like the middle class has vanished. You're either getting billions of views or selling 10 000 copies of your record and touring the hell out of it (250 shows a year in 15+ countries just to subsist around poverty level). The Canadian band Constantines were critically beloved but they never made much money. America has hundreds of such bands. Oneida. Wild Nothing. Wavves. Mac DeMarco (I guess he's a Canuck too). These acts make SOME money but they are irrelevant to the larger culture.

Whether it's his audience or not is a non-issue.

For people who are in the target group (myself and OP included), a certain amount of anachronisms for teens/children is jarring, and prevents some of us me from suspending our disbelief (for contemporary works).

While this doesn't need to be the case for sci-fi (assuming futuristic settings), I believe it should be done in contemporary horror. When not done, it's like having a British King speak in Patois--its just odd for some people and pulls them out of the story.

Many of us read fictional stories for escapism. But having a character that accurately reflects the group of that time, is immersion and assists with the ""escape"".

Additionally, much like the current impetus in publishing to accurately reflect different cultural groups as characters in books,  I think there should be an interest in doing the same for teens/children if the book is contemporary.

“Yo, what’s the move tonight, fam?” I shouted over the thumping bass in the air. Everybody was buzzing, feeling that rush, like we were kings of the concrete jungle.

“Let’s hit up that new spot down by Main, heard it's lit!” one of the boys said, eyes gleaming like he just chugged a Red Bull. The idea sent shockwaves through us, and we were instantly hyped, ready to mob.

As we strutted through the streets, the scene was straight-up electric. Cars zooming by, people laughing, the smell of street food wafting in the air. Mindless chaos was the vibe, and we were soaking it all in, chuckling at the rules that didn’t even matter to us. 

“Check it out,” I said, spotting a crew of unsuspecting peeps by the corner. “Time to spice things up.” We kicked it into high gear, adrenaline pulsing through our veins. 

“Let’s go, let’s go!” My crew echoed back, hyped and ready for the action. We hit ‘em with that unexpected energy, making them jump like they just got hit with a surprise TikTok trend. It was all a game, all a rush, and we were living for the chaos.","lv4yutt"

It isn't so much 472 new slang words, as it is a vastly reductive sense of vocabulary being laid out (even capitalization is now optional), images used to replace certain words, repeated imagery for emphasis (or a related term), and as many exclamation marks being crammed onto the end of a line as possible. It's damn near unreadable, not that this knowledge will stop me attempting to understand at least some of what is going on.

The joint was called ""Vibe Sips,"" and the neon glow practically screamed with energy. Instead of milk, they served up Quantum Coolers—a concoction mixing lab-grown proteins, mood-enhancing adaptogens, and a splash of synthetic fruit essence. Everything was blacklight reactive, making it feel like a rave crossed with a science fair.

Alex and his crew slid into a booth, the faux-leather seats popping with holographic color. The menu was a trip; you could get a “Chill Vibe” with nano-caffeine or a “Psychedelic Swirl” that promised to enhance your dopamine levels just by looking at it. You could almost hear the place bouncing with bass-heavy beats, while a influencer live-streamed her experience, her followers going wild in the comments.

“Yo, fam, hit me up with a Quantum Cooler, the mood-enhancing strawberry splash,” Alex declared, his eyes wide with the electric energy of the place. 

“Make mine a ‘Neon Bliss’ with extra euphoria, and don’t skimp on the bio-glitter!” chimed in his buddy, Pete. The waiter, a dude sporting virtual reality goggles stuck atop his head, nodded with a grin that showed off his LED-studded braces.

“You got it, squad!” he chirped. “Just a sec, I’ll ping that to the drone server.”

As they waited, the walls shook with a remix of the latest viral hit, and everything felt alive, like they were on the edge of something mad and magnificent. The Quantum Coolers arrived, orbiting on mini-drones with a smoothness that was almost poetic. Each cup pulsed with a subtle glow, like a neon galaxy ready to be explored.

“Cheers to cosmic vibes and good times!” Alex toasted, raising his Quantum Cooler high. The crew followed suit, and they all took a sip. “Whoa! Tastes like happiness and a hint of rebellion!” he exclaimed, his pupils dilating like kaleidoscopes. 

“Let’s get hyped!” shouted Pete, already scrolling through his phone to start a challenge where they attempted to down their drinks in under a minute.","lv6cmnn"

"lv2wu6l","Gary_James_Official","2024-11-02 21:23:25 UTC","I recognize that using ""witty"" is probably pushing things - memes have always been on a par with knock, knock jokes, limericks, and slapstick... You either get the joke immediately, or the form is at least *comprehensible* if not laugh-out-loud funny. The most complex memes of 2008 were still understandable to anyone not familiar with the subject of their content.

While I wasn't target audience for a great deal of the memes, they didn't take a lot of work untangling - the girl smiling in front of a burning building, with text added to indicate what was on fire... Clown sightings, treated like terrorist attacks... While a great deal of the language and imagery was relatively simple, it contained a much recurring themes, enabling layering.

Now layering \\*is\\* the meme, at least in part. Pixelation, along with other visual distortion, and increasingly minimalist - or deliberately misspelled and truncated - text.

Logan has shown me things that he's seeing passed around, and I've admitted that I have zero clue as to what I'm looking at most of the time - there's not even familiar formats being used as a base, permitting some reading of the images. Surrealism seems to be creeping back into vogue as well, making it difficult to tell whether any image actually has a deeper meaning or not.","lv2maz6"

I just don't feel like age is a reason to be unaware of something. I don't expect a 77 year old to only be able to write about their own life experience, especially in this day and age of easy accessibility. I enjoy reading things that are well researched, even if they're fiction. To each their own, though.","lv2iy3g"
"lv3g50u","inEQUAL","2024-11-02 23:16:20 UTC","You assume that a good story has to be “plotted out.” I disagree. I’m with King, it feels more human and real the way he does story. And clearly it works well, considering he writes best-selling page turners. He literally *has* to accomplish what you’re saying he doesn’t in order for that to be possible. You just don’t want to accept his methods and style because they’re outside of whatever prescriptivist view on writing you seem to hold. Congratulations, you earn brownie points with literary snobs and critics, but it’s nonsense outside of that limited bubble.","lv2xijs"

Same with Hunger Games, though interestingly as it fades from view it's now used more to refer to a more generic dystopian dog-eat-dog scenario than it is the books themselves. I know I never read the books myself, but have a feel for what Hunger Games ""means"". So I would say Hunger Games actually might qualify like Catch-22, if it lasts another decade or two in the vernacular.","lvays6j"

Still, beign roughtly equal to the 90s does not mean our children are scoring historically low. The entire variation of scores is *much* less dramatic looking when you zoom out a bit. The math score, which is the more varied one, goes between 219 and 241, so a 22 point gain, and we lost 7 from 2020, so that is still a 15 point gain since the 70s. Insofar as that test is accurate, this is not apocalyptic.

And yes, it is a sudden and extremely steep decline, but it's suddenness, and the specific *time* when it happened, is probably easily explained. It would be more worrying if it was just declining year over year for a longer period. Massive social stress and isolation is exactly the kind of thing that would be likely to cause a sudden decline.","lv8nd54"

He wrote one book about cell phones and even still the actual behaviors on the devices were very minor in regard to the actual plot of the story, accurate as far as i remember but nothing to do with the plot. If the plot is revolves around tik tok or something like that then yes i definitely agree it should be well researched.  If it’s just mentioned in passing as long as the statement is structurally sound then it really doesn’t bother me one way or the other. I guess it depends on the author. And i guess most downvotes are coming from people who are disagreeing with you in regard to king because this post was about him specifically.","lv2k77j"

I never said anything about what good story has to be, and I've said repeatedly that he's a great storyteller. But a good writer, someone who's good at the craft can plot.

Read King's book about the Kennedy assassination, then read Ellroy's. 

Ellroy's is obviously far better written, and Ellroy isn't a literary darling he's a pulp writer.","lv3g50u"

The few King novels I read, I found the same as you mention. I liked that his recent novels (Billy Summers) mostly take place out-of-time, therefore feeling timeless even if they're modern. I actually find it a bit jarring when he mentions modern politics, because it makes it feel less timeless to me, but maybe that works for some.","lv2l6ok"
