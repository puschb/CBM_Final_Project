"lrbl4w5","space-cyborg","2024-10-10 22:08:13 UTC","I read it with my book club years ago, and it was like we had read two different books. Half of us read a book where a mom is the only one who realizes that her child is a developing sociopath. Her husband and everyone else gaslights her and tells her she needs to work harder to connect with him, and she is tragically proved correct.

And half of us read a book about an unstable, withholding, cruel mother who had such low expectations for her child that he ended up lashing out in terrible ways.

Really great writing on Shriver’s part.",""
"lrat8r3","onioning","2024-10-10 19:35:08 UTC","Shriver is indeed the best. Love almost everything she's written.

There's a condition where a mother doesn't bond with a new baby. Forget what it's called, but it happens. Notably, those babies have a much higher chance of being sociopaths. I'm not sure its right to put all the blame on Eva. I think that complication is very much central to the book. Did Kevin turn out as Kevin because of Eva? Or did Eva react as she did because Kevin was Kevin?",""
"lrbw865","Hagridsbuttcrack66","2024-10-10 23:17:31 UTC","It's interesting that you come away feeling everybody sucks and I came away feeling absolutely sorry for everyone involved. 

It didn't feel like anyone in this book started out completely malicious or had nefarious intentions from the word go. 

You have a woman who found love late and never wanted to be a mother. Who had a complicated relationship with her own mother. Who, like so many people had been told for years and years,  figured she would grow to love it. Because, you know, that's what  EVERYBODY says. 

You have the husband who yeah is a little naive, but isn't it nice to have someone who just wants a loving family with all the little tropes. Like even though this book was written a couple decades ago, isn't his fantasy something people are now lamenting the loss of? I know they are wealthy, but he really just wants the basic American dream - the two kids, the picket fence. It's endearing until it's infuriating, but I never found him completely unsympathetic. 

And then Kevin who didn't ask to be here, like none of us does, so maybe being treated like a constant burden from day one does seep you into you even if you are materially fine, even if you've never had to go hungry, maybe you are hungry for something. And mentally he is not okay, but why. Eva notes the time when he is sick that she is surprised to find he is not mad - he is sad. Does she ever dig deeper?

Maybe its because I'm a childless woman who has heard the age-old ""you'll love them when they're yours"" a million times, but I empathized with Eva a great deal and loved the exploration of this particular chain of events. Everyone always comments about what if your kid is disabled or had a disease or needs constant care. But what if you just don't particularly like your kid? What if being a mom isn't for you, but there's no going back?

This is one of my favorite books ever, and I've read it a bunch of times. I still find it as completely fascinating as the first time I read it.",""
"lrbfdtr","Dotsgirl22","2024-10-10 21:34:11 UTC","It’s a fabulous read. But very, very disturbing. I didn’t sleep right for a few nights after I finished it.  I donated it to the library book sale because, well, the book itself felt evil. I can’t explain it. But of course it’s just a book.

The author did a great job of creating suspense and doubt.  If you live long enough, you will meet at least one person who is evil. This book created the same feeling you get when you are around an evil person. I’m not a touchy-feely person at all but sometimes intuition overrules the rational brain. For an author to provoke such a powerful visceral response in a suspense novel is an achievement in itself. 

There’s an older British author who wrote a similar powerful book on this same topic, but I can’t recall her name. The book dates back quite a few years and is considered a classic.",""

Franklin lived in the same home as Eva, even if he went out of his way to spend as little time as possible there once he handicapped her career by tying her down with a baby that he wanted but she was at best vocally ambiguous about. He saw or heard about a lot of the same incidents as Eva did, and he chose to interpret them an entirely different way. He knew that strange incidents attributed directly to Kevin's unusual cruelty seem to follow his son literally anywhere he steps foot and at every corner he chose to make an excuse for Kevin instead of even seriously considering the fact that Kevin might be the problem. If your son leaves dozens of people across various locations who are visibly terrorized by him everywhere he goes, how long of a leeway do you get to pretend like they just weren't a good fit instead of admitting that your son's behavior is concerning? And then every time Eva tried to raise the issue, Franklin became angry and attacked her personally instead of even entertaining the conversation.

"lrbwvcv","maureenmcq","2024-10-10 23:21:32 UTC","Novelist and screenwriter here; novels and screenplays are different, and adaptations are complicated, but I would disagree with saying a film is more limited.  It is shorter, but it has access to visuals, sounds, and music, which are layered to convey an effect.  Books (my primary medium) have access to a characters interior thoughts.  Movies are often full of ambiguity.  

The book is a tough book.  Right now we believe culturally that children can be raised to be happy and healthy, and that trauma and neglect are the inevitable reasons for someone like Kevin.  I’m not sure research is bearing that out. The book is exploring that in a very dramatic way because, well, we like when books are dramatic.

There is a long history in the west of blaming mothers.  Autism, for example, was blamed on ‘refrigerator mothers’ without recognizing that many autistic children are oversensitive to touch because it causes sensory overload.  So women with autistic children didn’t hug and cuddle.  

You can see psychopathy on a brain scan, and a neuroscientist named James Fellon discovered he was psychopathic when he read his own.  The book is called THE PSYCHOPATH INSIDE and talks about how he can look back and see the indications.  Psychopathy is on a scale, like Autism or any mental diagnosis.  Fellon is highly functional.  Some psychopaths aren’t.

The book explores a woman with a complicated relationship to her child, who feels responsible for her child’s behavior and who may or may not have contributed to it.  

I didn’t like everything about the book.  But mothers in film are only allowed to be good mothers or monsters, and the relationship, the one single relationship everyone has, however briefly, is almost never conveyed except in terms of ‘good’ or ‘bad’.  As a mother, I lived in a world where I was held to an exacting standard where it was only ever my fault.  My kid is grown, has a good life, we’re close.  But the one thing I identified with in the book was both, ‘is this my fault?’","lrblza2"

He was studying MRIs of psychopaths brains, which apparently have noticeable differences from ""regular"" brains and one he had had done of himself was mixed in the pile. That's when he realised he had a ""psychopath"" brain. He had always had some signs, like low empathy and being quite calculating, but had a successful life and was happily married. He attributed the difference between him and the violent psychopaths in prison for their crimes, to his loving and supportive home. It really goes to show it's most likely a mixture of nature and nurture - some people are born a bit differently, but what happens to them can shape what type of adult they become. Then there's the reverse, with kids who grew up in traumatic, abusive situations turning into good, kind adults.

Of course, there's also the brain injury and damage side you mentioned too, which can be a big factor.","lrbqc02"
"lrc0iei","chrisrevere2","2024-10-10 23:44:28 UTC","My apologies - qualification needed. The author and narrator imply that Kevin was anti-social/sociopathic from birth. (Not trying to be facetious - did not mean to that this was realistic/possible.)","lrbqc02"
"lrcs9nz","Sweeper1985","2024-10-11 02:40:05 UTC","True. However, it does seem that some people are born with certain neurological differences which are highly associated with callous-unemotional traits and psychopathy. Way back years ago at university one of my professirs actually focused his research on callous-unemotional trait kids and what kinds of behavioural interventions were helpful for them. IIRC these kids came from reasonably diverse backgrounds so it wasn't like they were all abuse victims.

Of course since Eva is an unreliable narrator, we can't know for sure, but I always felt there was an element of both nature and nurture for Kevin, just as there is for most people's personalities and behaviour. Some of his behaviours as a child do seem outside the norm even for kids with insecure parental attachments. E.g. (if Eva's account is true) that from a very young age he didn't care much about human relationships, respond to affection or positive reinforcement, and seems to enjoy seeing people get hurt or upset.","lrbqc02"

Franklin was an idiot who ignored the multiple red flags about his precious son. I am pretty sure there was something off about Kevin since his birth but with 2 different parents his future would have been very different and his schoolmates wouldn’t have died an horrible death.","lre2x7v"

I’ve read a few interviews with Shriver and she never either confirmed or deny any of the things Eva *says* Kevin did (or the emotions and intentions she attributed to him), for instance, whether he intentionally blinded Celia or not. In fact, she said those parts were all meant to be ambiguous and up to the readers.

The explanation his neuropsychologist gave me was this: children's personalities do not fully develop and ""lock in"" until age 18 due to frontal lobe growth and development and with proper treatment, some symptoms may be reversed. 




The issue is, people with ASPD do not feel that they have a problem and do not want treatment.  My son has been living in a residential facility for 2 years because he refuses treatment and has not legally offended.  He has made threats and I have protected him and our community to the best of my ability.  However,  he has been clear that, if he were to come home, would likely kill me or SA his sister. 
We are in a catch 22 where he is too young to be diagnosed, but cannot be labeled properly in residential either. 




Getting a diagnosis in the first place was a battle because he has no trauma history but his entire life had had what they call the three C'S: callus, cold, calculating. At age 8 he was asked to describe himself in class and he proudly stated he was ""manipulative"". We took him for his first neuropsych then and it was determined he has a genus IQ and ADHD.","lrbxcgg"

But looking at all of Eva's actions since the shooting, far from avoiding her share of the responsibility, she is positively wallowing in it. The aftermath of the shooting is the first time in Kevin's miserable life that most people wouldn't have blamed her for washing her hands of him. But what Eva did instead is she sunk all of her wealth into Kevin's defense and got him a much more favorable sentence than he deserved, she stayed in the house she hated and took all the abuse in stride until she needed the money from the sale, she lives in a dumpy apartment and she spends her weekends visiting Kevin even though she hates it. This is not a woman trying to absolve herself of responsibility, it's one going out of her way to carry the cross that she feels she deserved.

To me the book reads like Eva finally giving up on a small part of her self-flagellation. This entire series of letters to her dead husband is Eva's treatise on all the times she did in fact see exactly what was going on and tried to stop it, but was consistently undermined by him.

Please remember that this is a book, planned and written by an author. If the author wanted Eva to be read as an unreliable narrator, then she would've shown how we needed to question her credibility. There would be parts of the book that show what REALLY happened. There would be an answer to the central nature v nurture question in the book that a close reading would reveal even if Eva herself never understood that or saw it that way. But none of this happened in this book. In this book, Eva narrates the story with the information she has. Yes we aren't getting a full objective picture because we can only see it through Eva's eyes, but she is as credible as any first person narration. This is not the same thing as an unreliable narrator. More importantly, there isn't another fuller more objective story presented in any way, it doesnt exist, the author doesn't show it or hint at it anywhere else in the book. The intention is for the question to be unanswered and unanswerable. It is deliberately ambiguous, there is nothing in the book to give evidence to either side. This is the entire point of the book.
