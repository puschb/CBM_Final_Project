I'm a teacher at a High School in the US and I have been selected for a committee to examine four books that local parents and the school board feel are inappropriate to be stocked in our library. The books are as follows

    Flamer by Mike Curato

Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is for you then. It is the first series after LOTR that I found captures how the characters in LOTR cherish and care for each other, while not being derivative at all. 

People often call the series a bridge between LOTR and ASOIAF, but I feel that's not fair at all to Tad. He's standing on his own foundations and should be much more popular than he is.

In the meanwhile, the American Library Association has collated a really nice [resource hub](https://www.ala.org/tools/challengesupport/youthresourcesFAQ) for contending with challenges in youth school settings. Would highly recommend making use of them to support framing productive discussions around this topic and to pushback against censorship because it is seldom about needing to argue why a specific book is appropriate - that has already been decided by a litany of authoritative persons, boards, and organizations. Rather, it is about ensuring students have access to resources and that parents cannot dictate what is or isn't appropriate for other people.

"lr43456","XBreaksYFocusGroup","2024-10-09 16:30:53 UTC","I read **Flamer** as well as **All Boy's Aren't Blue** and was very impressed with both. One prominent takeaway is that it really feels like these books in particular are so strategically and heavily targeted for censorship because they are really effective at what they set out to do - providing kids with stories to better understand themselves. The introduction in All Boys Aren't Blue is beautiful prelude and framing for both - that the spectrum of traumas can be as broad as our identities and that we sometimes cannot see ourselves until we see other people like you existing, thriving, and processing as told in unabashed honesty. And All Boy's Aren't Blue is a memoir while Flamer heavily borrows from autobiographical events. Both deal in intersectionality and the reality of navigating yourself through often unhelpful language and popular cultural archetypes. They embody themes of being asked to hide, deny, or change parts of yourself in a never ending list of demands that you make yourself respectable and non-threatening to people who refuse to ever see you as such. Which are messages that extends beyond queerness and racial identities and suitable for kids as well as adults who have never known they could question and challenge the expectations we all labor under. Or those of us who can use the reminder. I honestly don't understand how anyone could read these and not be better, more empathetic persons for the experience.

Flamer could sincerely be taught in an academic course on creative writing. It is really solid as an aesthetic product and has some masterfully layered symbolism which shows the place that art theater has in these discussions. And All Boy's Aren't Blue spans so much of the queer as well as the Black American experience through an articulate and insightful perspective that a lot of books fall short of. I thought about annotating responses to all of the specific accusations of impiety and obscenity levied at these works but to paraphrase George M Johnson, the scenes and language these books employ are done so to create intentional emotional and intellectual responses. And because there is value in representing these experiences in their entirety because they happened to these authors as they happen to many kids in the demographic for which they have been decided. I would be happy to talk more impressions about the books or go into reasons why these censorship challenges are legally, ethically, and intellectually baseless (as well as studies that support why providing kids with diverse stories and narratives which communicate sensitive topics is wildly beneficial) but this comment is already super long. Let me know if any of this resonates or you want more. Best of luck with your committee discussion. Really rooting for you and for the kids.","lqv6app"

I don't think I've ever come across a copy of Little Women that didn't include Part Two.(at least in the US). The movie you saw includes both Little Women and Good Wives. The sequel to Little Women is Little Men and I don't recommend it unless you really love reading about young kids.


Edited to add, if you loved Little Women, you might like March, by Geraldine Brooks. It's a Pulitzer winning novel about the March father during the war.


You might also like books by Lucy Maude Montgomery.","lr106gu"

And if memory serves, this knowledge is by no means a significant spoiler. Could go into reasons why for both but that is probably a minor spoiler in itself. But I would encourage you to continue.
