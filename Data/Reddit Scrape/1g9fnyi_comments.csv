"lt5m4fc","wh0remones","2024-10-22 11:25:32 UTC","I personally don‚Äôt generally read an introduction to fiction before reading the novel as these ate generally (in my experience) on new editions of older books and I find they often contain spoilers. I did however read them when doing my English degree. 

I would however read a prologue as this is part of novel. 

An epilogue I would read at the end as this is at the end of the novel. I class this as part of the novel and would always read this however to read an epilogue first would be a massive spoiler and therefore I read it at the end as intended. 

For an authors note, again I would only read this at the end as that is generally where they come in the book and can contain spoilers - I on read an authors note if I am particularly interested in finding out more. 

Basically prologues and epilogues always as these are part of the novel but only read introductions and authors notes if I want more information",""

I don't understand why some people apparently skip prologues. Generally there is a reason the author included it as part of the story, often giving a glimpse of the direction where the story will eventually be going.

That's like saying ""yeah, I always skip straight to chapter two and start there."" There is likely going to be important narrative or setting details in there, what purpose does skipping it serve? 

And the only reason you skipped it is that it was titled ""Prologue"" instead of ""Chapter 1""? Or maybe to have less to read? But if you're starting off the book by skipping bits for the sake of having less to ""get through"" like it's a chore, why are you bothering to read it in the first place?

I was pointing out something in it and she was asking where that part was as she must have missed it. Interestingly, she read an author interview after the epilogue and gleaned other interesting points I missed as it wasn‚Äôt in my version. We had a lovely lunch discussing :)","ltggwe4"
"ltac99h","Aplakka","2024-10-23 03:27:31 UTC","If I hear a spoiler like ""it ends with 'it was all a dream'"", that might actually increase my enjoyment since I hate that kind of surprise. If it's something like ""everybody dies at the end"", that is something that was once spoiled to me in practice (for a movie though) and it did notably decrease my enjoyment of the movie but I did still watch it.

But in this case it was like 5 pages of explaining every part of the plot, every character, all subplots, emotional beats, who dies at the end, etc. If that makes me weird that I didn't want to read the book after knowing everything about it, I guess I'm weird. Probably it would have been better in the actual book when written by the original author, but the summary also made it sound like there wasn't much interesting in the book for me anyway.","lt8kmmp"
