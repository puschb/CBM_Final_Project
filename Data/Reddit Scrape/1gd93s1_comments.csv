"lu08xrv","Wild_Caramel_9557","2024-10-27 13:40:19 UTC","A Thousand Splendid Suns. I read it in one night because I kept hoping something good would happen for these people. It was heartbreaking and left me depressed for quite a while. But, I felt immediately that this is something all Americans of a certain age should read. Those of us who were teenagers or adults during the 9-11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan.

When I was young I bought into the propaganda the government was selling and felt pride at what we were doing liberating the Afghanis. I had already started to have misgivings as I got older. This book gave me such a different perspective on the whole situation. It takes place over several years starting with the Russian occupation, then the Taliban, then it ends with the United States coming in. Nothing changed or got better for these poor women and most things got incredibly worse. The ending is hopeful as the US takes over but it still feels like they have no control over themselves and their government. Just another occupying force dictating how they should run their lives not caring about their culture or history.

It is a hard read if you have any kind of empathy for others, but I feel like it is such an important story for many of us to read.",""

*Aerobics*, by Dr. Kenneth Cooper

I was one of those kids who was totally crap at anything athletic.  Was always chosen last when picking sides for softball or indeed any team sport.  Remember that scene in *Carrie* where she is playing volleyball with her schoolmates and hits the ball badly and is made fun of by all the other girls?  That was me, except I was a boy so it was the other boys.  Wasn't obese, but always overweight.  

And then I read *Aerobics*, in which Dr. Cooper explained how important aerobic health was, and, more importantly, gave several programs in a huge number of disciplines (running, walking, swimming, dancing, bicycling, stationary bicycling, and many many more) to achieve aerobic health.

Now I am 72 and can still run a 10K on a good day.

"lu04qwp","Algernon_Asimov","2024-10-27 13:11:29 UTC","Copy-pasting my answer [from the last time this question was posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1epgcex/have_you_ever_read_a_book_that_changed_how_you/lhkvy06/):

***

**The Selfish Gene** was a book that changed my views on life - but *not* because of the genetics or the biology. 

It's because of Chapter 12 of the 1989 revised edition of this book, entitled ""**Nice guys finish first**"". This is one of the two chapters that Dawkins added for this revised edition. 

This chapter is about the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma), which is a famous game used in game theory. In the game, each player chooses to cooperate or defect (*without* communicating with the other player!), and both players are rewarded or punished depending on the interaction of both players' decisions. The rewards and punishments are arranged in such a way that both players get punished if both players defect, both players get rewarded if both players cooperate, but a player gets the highest possible reward if they defect while the other player cooperates. In particular, ""**Nice guys finish first**"" is about an *iterated* version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, where two players keep playing the game repeatedly with each other - and can use their memory of prior rounds to influence their decision in future rounds. 

In this chapter, Dawkins describes a computer programming tournament based on the Prisoner's Dilemma, where programmers were invited to create programs which would play the iterated game against other programs. (This tournament is also covered in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM).) Each program had its own strategy. Some were cooperative, some were non-cooperative, some were nice, some were nasty, and so on. The challenge was to devise a strategy that would win most consistently against all other strategies. The organiser paired each program with all other programs in a round-robin format, played them against each other repeatedly, and determined which program gained the most rewards overall. 

Today, there's even [an online interactive game](https://ncase.me/trust/) based on this tournament.

Surprisingly, the most successful program was *nice* and *forgiving*. It was called Tit For Tat. It started out by cooperating as its default choice. As long as the program it was paired with cooperated, Tit For Tat kept cooperating. If the other program defected in one game, Tit For Tat would defect in the next game, but only that one time, before reverting to cooperating in the game after that, until the other program defected again, in which case Tit For Tat would defect in the next game, and then again revert to cooperating in the game after that, and so on. 

This strategy consistently achieved the most rewards against *all other strategies*, even the nastiest, most defection-oriented strategies. They even ran the tournament a second time, and invited more programmers to submit more programs - and Tit For Tat won again. 

Tit For Tat never did the wrong thing first, always punished another program for doing the wrong thing, but always forgave the other program if it stopped doing the wrong thing. 

That made an impression on me. That has influenced how I deal with other people.",""

"ltzwz0j","Hisandhersshhh","2024-10-27 12:11:41 UTC","Read the book Aphrodite's Daughters written by Jalaja Bonheim and came out of it with new feelings on sex, women, and relationships in general.

So I grew up as a kid with a single mom, who learned everything from my grandparents and went into the world, and the dating world aspiring to be a modern traditional provider/protector type. Like most men, I had many dating losses and woes due to not being able to adapt to the current dating market, and not understanding (still learning) womens motives to navigating and leading in the world. Which led to me seeking to change my dating strategies and relationship perspectives for my 30s, causing me to the buy the book.

Initially, I went into the book hoping to hear steamy sex stories from women to learn about what turns them on and how to each climax, but the book actually focuses on how peoples' life experiences, cultural norms and customs, and maturity over time shapes their sexual relationships with their partners and themselves. 

Rituals:
Bonheim reflects on how festivals and the Times of the year influence people's overall comfortability with environment, and themselves, leading to their being able to connect with others emotionally and spiritually. Here I learned the significance of celebration, and the idea of the festive spirit allowing humans to release, what we call bad vibes out of our body through dance, openness, and letting go.

- Made me think about events such as Mardi Gras, New Years, Carne Valle, etc. as opportunities to release all bad experiences from the year (or past) and start anew. Also learned the importance dancing to release bad energy, and now I know how importance club culture is 😂


Life Experiences: 
- How Life's experiences influence sexual partners through different phases of their lives, and how they change over time. So here we learn about lovers we meet for specific reasons, and that once those reasons are fulfilled, the relationship may be over, but the connection will always be there. Example is the 'Demon Lover'; who was basically a partner who we have no business being with, but the experience may help us fulfill a need to be wanted/desired, etc. and teach us to be better lovers to future partners.

- While I knew dating was a process, and a journey, I learned that the only destination in all of our journeys is death - physically, or ending of the relationship/connection with our partners; and that we will have many journeys with many different connections throughout our lifetime, so marriage and family, while it may be one partners initial destination, it may not be the other's final destination, and when the destination is reached, the purpose of that relationship will be fulfilled.


The Abyss: 
- A part of the female experience is to go through what Bonheim calls 'The Abyss' which is basically someone's darkest moments. She begins this theme with the stories of Inanna, and Presiphone, who both were brought into the Abyss due to situations that were out of their hands, and how they perished or flourished in the underworld.

- Bonheim then goes on to share some of her participant's upbringings and how being dragged into 'The Abyss' forced them to love themselves.


All in all, the book left me feeling enlightened and excited to re-enter the dating market when I'm ready (currentl healing from a previous relationship), now with the purpose of enjoying the experiences and journeys, and focusing less on 'getting it right.'

Love to hear everyone's thoughts; if you read the book or if this post peaked your interest. As well as hear your thoughts on dating, relationships, sex and the spiritually side of the three.",""

Even if you’re wrong, your deaths won’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. Why not leave a legacy of curiosity and compassion instead?

As a Western reader, it was also a really great and eye-opening glimpse into modern Chinese culture (values, historical underpinnings, interpersonal expectations, etc.).",""

My dad did a tour in Afghanistan in the 90s, and my mom went in 2009, when I was a junior in high school. I read it around the time she was told she'd be deploying, on her recommendation. We found out her unit was going to Iraq a few months later. 

I'd been spoonfed the usual propoganda up until that point. Then seeing through the lens of a boy caught in the twist of foreign occupation, watching his entire way of life crumble around him, made me realize there was much mord nuance to the issue at hand than just hunting down Al Qaeda. Saddam Hussein had already been deposed in Iraq, and the U.S. was engaged in a nation building campaign there. We didn't initially know whether she was going to Iraq or Afghanistan and that was scary for its own reasons. But getting that perspective in the form of a small story about one man's journey from a childhood in peace time to living through a proxy war and immigrating out of it humanized a people I had until then believed to be broadly supportive of the terrorist groups in their midst. 

It was eye opening. Very much needed both in order to understand what life might be like for regular people over there, and later, why my parents never really talked about their deployments.","lu08xrv"

Prior to reading the book, I pursued studies in Psychology and Sociology. The more I studied the social sciences, the more questions I had – and that was a bit discomforting.  I read this book and developed a new appreciation and attitude for science and technology. I quit my studies in the social sciences and later pursued a curriculum in Computer Science.  In short, the book opened my eyes to a way of seeing the world I might have otherwise missed.  The book was quite popular at the time but I don’t think it would have the same appeal today.  A large part of the book focuses on the definition of “Quality” and what it means to different folks depending on how they see the world.","lu2mjqc"

"ltzzx0y","Deleted","2024-10-27 12:35:31 UTC","The only other assigned reading book that hit me the same way was lord of the flies, not because of the sheer violence but specifically the scene when they attack Simon

They attack simon because in that moment he is the beast, he is the unknown and in that sense he is the dark- he is what we as humans do not know. He’s the thing you think you see in the dark. And he was trying to rid everyone of those fears, those fears of the things they see in the dark, and they just slaughtered him.

That hit me really hard. Like, the ugly truth that we often will be so scared of these primitive fears- the fear of what we don’t understand and the primitive urge to engage in pack mentality, to save the pack from the unknown. When you’ve seen violence happen in real life because of pack mentality, that scene just really really really takes a new turn. 

I’ve seen it at a party. Everyone attacked this one person for no reason. And he almost died. It was horrible. But everyone in that moment thought they were doing the best thing for the “pack” they felt in their element because they weren’t alone. Sometimes those old books really hit you in a different way. They’re timeless in their lessons.","ltzyrs0"

He knows magic, because he goes to magic school, but he is not even close to being unnaturally gifted or anything. He's middle of the road in his class.

Doesn't cry of flinch, true. Also probably runs through fire but I don't remember that. Is this really a sign of a Gary Stu, though? Doing something sort of brave in a fantasy book?

He does *not* play musical instruments better than anybody else. There are several people at the tavern that are better musicians than him. 

He *doesn't* perform above his ability in his courses, that's the thing. He doesn't excel at it. He has some talent but several of his classmates are better at it than him","lu3duas"
