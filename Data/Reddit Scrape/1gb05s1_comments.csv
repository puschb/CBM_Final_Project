* Trigger warnings don't reduce the emotional distress of experiencing graphic content.
* The warnings also don't lead people to avoid or opt out of graphic content.
* Trigger warnings do lead to more anticipatory anxiety before viewing graphic content.

And I say that as a person who's sat through lectures that have brought me near to tears because of what they're bringing up in me, emotionally. I teach literature, and I've had students use them simply as a way to avoid engaging with the reading, and ultimately with the class. I do my best to put any content warnings I feel they may need—for author's time period/attitudes, specific themes, etc. And I tell my students that if they find while reading that something is too much for them to feel comfortable discussing in class, to shoot me an email and I'll excuse their absence for the day. The last thing I want to do as an educator is force someone to sit in a conversation that's upsetting them. BUT, I've had students use that as a way to do none of my reading. In the past, I tried to work with them, finding alternatives. But from a teaching perspective, when one person is reading a different book from everyone else every week, they can't be truly engaged in the class and everyone suffers for it.

And, there are some stories where a trigger warning would, in fact, ruin the experience. For example, I teach Hemingway's 'Hills Like White Elephants.' If you're not familiar with it, the story >!is about two people discussing (possibly, though it's never said outright) abortion!< The first time I taught it, I didn't include a CW, and I had a religious student express to me that they were very disturbed by the content. So, I put a CW for it the next time I taught it, and students complained that the CW gave the game away and detracted from the experience of reading the literature on its own merit. So, now I teach it as it is. The brilliance of that piece is in the ambiguity.

So, I guess I'm torn. I see their value at things like open mics (though, I think they can be overused as a form of self-masturbation), and in your own private reading. But, in class... I've assigned the texts I have for a reason, and that reason is to help you grow as a reader of literature.",""

""Most studies (Bellet et al., 2020; Boysen et al., 2021; Bridgland et al., 2019; Gavac, 2020; Sanson et al., 2019) have concluded that trigger warnings have a trivial impact on emotional responses.

Only one study concluded that warnings may reduce emotional reactions toward material (Gainsburg & Earl, 2018).""

""Taken together, the current study and other research suggest that trigger warnings do not seem to be an effective method of preventing vulnerable populations from engaging with distressing stimuli.""


Their conclusion: 

""Existing research on content warnings, content notes, and trigger warnings suggests that they are fruitless, although they do reliably induce a period of uncomfortable anticipation. Although many questions warrant further investigation, trigger warnings should not be used as a mental-health tool.""


I have followed this research as well. My personal tentative conclusion is that trigger warnings are a bit like fast food: people can really, REALLY want a burger for dinner every night but that doesn't mean it's good for them. (A trigger warning that feels helpful to a person can actually be bad for their mental health.)

Now, it’s true, just like you said, that it merely mentions a topic. Not who it affects or how it manifests. But now I know that it’s going to happen and it’s subconsciously in the back of my mind the entire time I’m reading and not in a way where it makes me excited to read further.

Like when is it going to happen? Who is it happening to? How will it be handled? I don’t want these questions. They’re genuinely distracting. 

Also, I read The Road by Cormac McCarthy last year. The scenes that made that book have impact and made me sit up and consider what had just happened - basically what made it land - was effective because I didn’t know it was going to happen and it would have 100% been a trigger warning. That trigger warning would have softened the blow so much that it wouldn’t have had any impact at all.

But that’s not to say that people shouldn’t be able to access trigger warnings for books if they want them. That’s fine. I understand why some feel they need them (although I do believe there’s an argument to be made that trigger warnings become triggering. It was discussed that it was happening on twitter some years ago where they had to change the words for the trigger warnings because the warning became triggering as well. So I take the whole thing with a grain of salt. I accept it as a courtesy toward others who could be in vulnerable situations, rather than a scientifically proven effective tool).

Full disclosure, I write horror. 

I think trigger warnings may be appropriate when reading something wherein the offending material may be completely unexpected...like a romance novel that contains an unexpected graphic scene, or a general fiction or other genre wherein one might not expect it. 

In my genre, horror, however, I find trigger warnings slightly odd. The reason is that when one reads a specific genre it's because they want to FEEL something. Romance readers obviously want to feel ROMANCE coming from the pages. A romance novel without romance, that doesn't make the reader FEEL the genre, is missing the mark. So a violent SA or violent murder scene would be sort of unexpected and a trigger warning feels appropriate.

The same concept applies to HORROR. A horror novel should do just that: horrify you. Slapping a trigger warning on a horror novel is kind of like milking a bull in my opinion. It serves no purpose. The unexpected, and the startling, is what makes a truly good horror novel what it is. 

That's just my opinion and I don't fault anyone for holding a different view.

Avoidance is one of the most pernicious symptoms of PTSD, elevating it to a protective self-care tool doesn’t help. I also find it a harmful idea to those recently traumatized, the majority of people don’t develop PTSD they naturally recover, but elevating the language of avoidance to completely prevent physiological reactions is teaching pathology. Teaching patients they’re made of glass and will explode dangerously if exposed to triggers is harmful. 

I think you’re also not seeing the nuance of things like rape and murder can and should put all humans in an elevated fight/flight state, the pathology of PTSD is that neutral things put you in a fight or flight state or you’re so fearful of your fight or flight you do anything you can to avoid it. That’s why in virtual reality exposure therapy for combat, they don’t have blood. Blood in combat is a real threat and we have a human, visceral reaction to it and for PTSD it doesn’t need to be desensitized (phobia treatment may differ).

Since then I have gone from being indifferent to trigger warnings to almost abhorring them. To me it feels like my pain is trivialised and that someone knows what I feel and what makes me feel it.
Scenes of suicide don’t trigger me, I’ll tell you what has:

- the loose change menu at McDonalds
- seeing the car my sister used to drive
- some music
- Harry Potter
- advertisements for cruise ships
- my daughters birthday
- my birthday 

Now it’s been nearly a year since my sister passed and none of the above trigger me anymore… but what if I avoided them. Well for starters my life would be shit and I wouldn’t have come as far as I have.

Emotions are necessary, they come with a message and avoiding them is counterproductive in your healing.

Triggers are not simple and trigger warnings make them appear to be. 

I am determined to be stronger for all this pain otherwise what is the point.

There is a few studies that back up the claim that trigger warnings have a net negative effect on people, they’ve already been listed above.

I absolutely get annoyed at these.  When a random episode in a show contains a trigger warning up front about the content of that episode, then I know what's going to go on.

My issue with trigger warnings only comes when people who don't want to see them find them unavoidable, or hard to avoid.

I'm fine with people having ways to avoid something.  Let them find that on their own, in a place out of my sight.  Everyone wins.

Also, I really hate the idea of people using trigger warnings to quickly find material they disagree with in order to ban it.

They also lack nuance.  There can be a huge range in which something is described, from hints to where you can get an idea of what happened, to excruciating detail over most of the book.  A trigger warning treats both equally.  Think of it like a movie where one time a character says ""damn"" and another movie filled with f-bombs and the n-word.  At least with movies, there is nuance in the rating to help figure out the level of language used.  A trigger warning like ""language"" if that was a thing would be a massive disservice.  What author should have their work skipped or banned because of a misleading catchall?

 My big issue worh trigger warnings printed in books is that they’re kind of limited and it’s hard to standardize. The rating system for movies is a good example of something standard and really bad. However, doesthedogdie.com is a fantastic resource for actually understanding triggers in movies. I think that a forum based, online trigger warning database for books that’s moderated appropriately is a MUCH better solution. Then it can actually get granular and cover a wide range. Trigger warnings need to be contextual. For example I run a horror blog and I don’t have trigger warnings on any of my articles for some of the common things like death, blood, dismemberment, or torture because that feels vaguely inherent to the material I’m covering. Like don’t come into my house of blood and be mad there’s blood. However, for an article that I’m writing about Fire Walk With Me, I added a trigger warning about dealing with themes of sexual assault because it’s not inherently expected and it’s not something I usually write about. So, basically, having a rule that all books must have trigger warnings about certain topics feel like they’re going to disproportionately affect certain genres with fanbases that already know what to expect because of genre convention.

While this may help some avoid content they perceive as sexual, it also misrepresents the artist’s intent. The painting isn’t sexual, but now everyone viewing it is given the impression that it is.

But trigger warnings are part of a larger cultural movement that includes 'safe spaces', microaggressions, and support for censorship. It all contributes to spreading the idea that one person's negative emotional reaction is other people's responsibility to manage: by learning what they find upsetting, giving warnings, and/or avoiding doing/saying some things altogether.


This frequently puts an unfair burden on others, and also reduces agency for the person being triggered. If other people are responsible for your emotional reactions, then you become dependent on them. In reality we are always partially dependent on other people, but it's much healthier to have a mindset of self-reliance: that your emotions are ultimately your problem and you need to learn to deal with them, even if that will take some time.


Trigger warnings haven't been confined to leisure reading, either; there are plenty of cases of them being added/demanded to be added to material in university courses, or for books to be removed from school curricula because they depict racist language or attitudes. It's obvious why people would have a problem with this.


My personal experience was first encountering trigger warnings on feminist blogs in the 00's. In fact, the very first trigger warnings were on links to flashing GIFs, because these can _trigger_ a fit in some epileptics. At first I thought the warnings were a good idea. But they rapidly metastasized to the point there was a whole paragraph of warnings at the start of each blog post. From rape and death, they expanded to include things like fatphobia and sexism. They became a declaration of which topics and views were considered 'problematic'; an implicit claim that those attitudes were as bad as the original very serious issues. The warnings started to bother me. Really, I think the underlying attitude - picking literature and everything else apart to discover these negative messages, always seeing the bad in everything - started to bother me. Eventually I stopped reading the blogs.",""

Not speaking for every situation but there is real utility to facing things we struggle with. That’s how you grow as a person. Constantly avoiding any sensitive subject matter will only make aversion to it that more pronounced because you’re not developing any coping strategies. Good art is *supposed* to provoke you. 

I’ve had multiple family members die from dementia and eventually Alzheimer’s. It’s the one thing that’ll send me into an existential spiral.

>The people for whom trigger warnings are important are typically not using them because they have something against literature that challenges them. They’re usually doing it because certain topics can trigger disproportionate physiological/psychological reactions that are hard to predict and difficult to control, so they’re avoiding these topics as part of the management of their mental well-being. There’s nothing wrong or shameful about prioritizing your psychological health over a theoretical need to ‘challenge yourself’, and there are plenty of books that readers can use to ‘challenge’ their ethics/philosophies/critical thinking without needlessly forcing themselves to endure additional mental trauma. A challenge doesn't need to be traumatizing in order to be a challenge.

This is my biggest issue, in conjunction with the current controversies over book-bannings/burnings.

I'm not particularly convinced that the demographic of people triggering content actively harms outweighs the demographic of people who willfully avoid topics because ""eww, ick.""

For a personal example, Episode 3 of *The Last of Us* TV series ""Long Long Time"" was probably some of the most thoughtful, gorgeous \\~50 minutes of cinema I've ever seen. But if it were fully up to my active tastes whether I watched it or not, I may have easily passed it over. And I consider myself pretty open-minded.

Some people really need their bitter medicine slipped into their candy, and being *too* sensitive about things, removing that element of surprise eliminates that possibility.

Triggers, in the psychological sense, are incredibly specific and personal.

As someone working in the mental health field, I can tell you the problem is not with the very real triggers people with PTSD suffer from. The problem is that people have isolated their own idea of triggers and built up their own mythology around it, using it as a weapon, in situations where nobody involved has PTSD. Teachers have come out telling of assignments they have given, such as in literature, where students have been ""triggered"" simply for being faced with an opinion they don't like, with consequences for the teacher. Debates have become fraught, for the same reason. And questioning the sanctity of these ""triggers"" is the worst crime of all.

I can see why this happens. There will always be people who misuse every system we make. Triggers become an easy way to get your way, so they will be used that way. Like depression before it, people claim diagnoses they don't have to win something.

Before my diagnosis - one of my OCD compulsions was finishing everything I started media wise. Every episode, book, cd. If I started a book that triggered me I would need to finish it despite the strong PTSD response. In fact, the PTSD triggers the OCD to make the compulsion to finish unbearable.

I was working with the first therapist who heard my story and mentioned trauma (I was 37 and had been in therapy done 14). I told her how I was reading a book and the story was identical to an event I lived that was very traumatic and I was dreading finishing it. And how I couldn’t get back in my body, was having strong night terrors and panic attacks.

And it was the first time I was told to stop consuming and avoid the trigger. It was like her giving me permission to stop broke the OCD hold and I was able to stop. I focused my CBT on not finishing the book and accepting I would not finish.

Now I use trigger warnings for all media. I use it by having a trusted group consume new media ahead of me and give me a thumbs up or down. I also am much more aware going into things if I feel the PTSD coming on, to turn it off and leave. 

But without the conversation about “you are allowed to not consume” I felt I was impolite to start and stop even if I never interacted with the content creator.

This recap you wrote and posted here is very necessary and it was very kind of you to take the time to do this. We all need a little less judgement and a little more grace in the world. I am so happy to see being trauma informed is being incorporated into your training. It caused my OCD to be misdiagnosed for decades because of how the PTSD OCD was so different from my baseline.

 As an author who has violent and frightening content in my stories, I decline to include triggers for anything.   
Most of the points ‘refuted’ so simplistically under the guise of psychology are the points I believe in.

 I don’t use trigger warnings because I won’t include spoilers of any events in the story; trigger warnings tell the reader, “Okay this event is coming sometime in the book.”  Having that in mind negates much of the work and care the author put into the story, crafting and building suspense which in turn rescues character building and pacing. Surprise is a good thing.

 Jump scares, rising tension, dread and revulsion all contribute to the story and the intentions of the writer.  People ARE too fragile these days. Self care is important, yes, but this coddling of fragility is not healthy for anybody, including the coddled. 

The fact is, reading unpleasant things, even things that terrify and even triggers us CAN help inoculate us against trauma. That is a fact taught in cognitive psychology. 

When I was 12 years old a family member died of cancer. I was traumatized so badly that the ‘cancer’ made me shudder my whole adolescence and adulthood. Seeing the word, thinking the word, hearing the word. A shudder. Every single time. It terrified me beyond measure. 

So when the book The Emperor of all Maladies (a biography of cancer) came out, I decided to read it. It cured of me that trauma. Since then. Two people close to me have passed away from cancer but I no longer have quite the same visceral reaction to it since reading the book which contained the word approximately one thousand times. 


I write thrillers and horror stories. They have violence and scary things in them. If someone doesn’t like that or it bothers them too much, they can go read something more  innocuous like Joanne Harris or other cozy authors.

There’s nothing wrong with those books and there are a lot of them.  Those are my perspectives. Everyone is free to have their own but to denigrate those who disagree is the height of arrogance. ",""

I think books move slowly enough that they’re easier to see coming, and there are often context clues before a traumatic event occurs. 

As someone who is more impacted by traumatic /triggering events on the screen, let me add a few things that help:

- I don’t watch movies in the theater anymore. If I do, I only go see ones that are “safe”, like maybe a Marvel film or a movie based on a book I’ve read. 

- I will often read the plot of a new movie from Wikipedia before I watch it if I’m nervous. There’s also a website called [does the dog die](https://doesthedogdie.com) that helps with lots of different triggers. So I also check that. 

- If I have a feeling a movie or show will be hard to watch or will bring up things for me, I like to watch it alone so that I can process things on my own and so that I can pause or turn it off if I need to. 

- I ask friends or family who have seen the movie how it is, if it has a happy ending, if certain things happen, etc.

- I try to avoid movies that have things I don’t like or don’t want to see. I just don’t watch them. 


I think if we can handle movies without on-screen trigger warnings then we can also handle books without on-page trigger warnings. It sucks to have trauma and feel anxiety or feel disturbed about certain forms of media…. But expecting everyone else to accommodate us just because we need extra warning doesn’t seem fair. 

My method with movies makes a lot of people uncomfortable, they don’t understand why I need to read the ending of a movie before I watch it. They think it ruins the whole thing.

"ltnwjl0","CerebralHawks","2024-10-25 10:55:03 UTC","I think it's interesting that there's such a divide between fan fiction/stories published online, and stories published in bookstores. I have literally never seen a book with trigger warnings, and I've read some disturbing stuff. I sought it out in my teens... and I found it. I'm still haunted by some of the things I've read, 30 years later.

If you publish stories on some of the top self-publishing platforms, they ask for trigger warnings up front, or you can choose to not show any (but this choice is shown to readers so they can decide to risk it, or not).

I think a lot of the readers (i.e. the target audience) of these platforms have triggers. Domestic/child abuse, thoughts of self harm, things like that. And specific to fan fiction, they can't handle major character death (one of the triggers an author can tag) because they might identify with that character.

One of the worse books I read was Visions by Dean Koontz. This is a good one for trigger warning discussions. I feel like, even on a Reddit community that is not censored, that is open to all kinds of discussion, I still can't say what happens toward the end of that story. I will say it falls under domestic violence, and child abuse. But, that's putting it *very* mildly! Should it have the trigger warnings? Multiple, since more than one apply? Maybe, but I think having them, I think if you were able to read them in advance, you know they're coming, takes the twist out of the story. (It just happens to be a really dark, depraved twist.)

That's also not the worst thing I've read — as far as triggering content, I mean. The book itself was fine, for old-school Koontz. But that scene? Koontz didn't need to go *nearly* that hard for that character's trauma, and now I think *I'm* afraid of >!bats!< as well. (Not really. I don't think I've ever seen one in person, and would love to pet one.)

At the end of the day though, I'm fine with trigger warnings in books. One good way to do it would be to place them in a place most people won't look. Like for a hardcover book, they can be on the *inside* of the dust jacket. So you open the book on the front and you have the blurb of what it's about, then at the bottom you have a symbol they decide on (not sure if one exists) and seeing that, you then pull the dust jacket off and look underneath, and it tells you what the warnings are. Those who don't want to see it don't have to. For paperbacks, they can place them at the end behind a blank page. So you open the back, you see the author photo and bio, and the last page is blank, but with that symbol at the bottom. Lift up and there's your trigger warnings. Those who don't want to see it won't see it until the very end, where it doesn't matter to them.

This isn't an either/or problem. We can solve this problem quite easily for those who have the problem, and for those who think it's a problem to have it in the first place, they don't have to look. If they're looking, it's because they sought it out.

However, the problem with my solution is that it only impacts *new* books. Books would have to be reprinted. So for people facing older books, there could be a website that guides them. For movies (and maybe TV shows), there's [Does the Dog Die?](https://www.doesthedogdie.com/), which, I just checked, says they cover video games **and books** in addition to TV shows and movies. The ""problem"" with DTDD is, they won't give you a list of media to avoid (because they're afraid sick people will use it to seek those things out). You have to look up the thing on their site. (I'm sure this strategy doesn't hurt their ad views. Nope, that couldn't be it at all! /s) Still, if you have trauma and you have triggers, it would be a good site to bookmark when you're out and about. Maybe the book you're looking at is covered, maybe it's not.",""

Even seeing genre types on Netflix descriptions with a 2 sentence synopsis description can spoil me; trailers spoil me; seeing certain actors or authors or directors spoil me. It takes a couple of words for me to figure out 85% of the story without ever opening the book/show/movie.

2) Life does not come with trigger warnings. Books are slices of life. Books should not come with a trigger warning. If something bothers me I stop engaging; this has happened only 3x in life with me. And 2x of those I gave it another shot and got through it. 1x of those was worth it. 

3) The middle ground for people who “just can’t” and everyone else is thus: like how publishers make a small run of special library book copies, a special run of TW books could be published and available from the publishers site or in libraries. This helps every sector involved.

They hear, “severe PTSD episodes are, to put it lightly, bad, so it’s kind to add a warning for the most common triggers to avoid doing that to people”, and start thumping their chest like a middle-aged patriot at a MAGA rally screaming about MUH FREEDUMS HOW DARE YOU THIS IS JUST LIKE 1984

These are, unfortunately, generally the same people who believe all of the mental health stigma and think PTSD is just being weak and “not handling your trauma like we did back in my day” and can be fixed by just going for a walk.

Some people seem to just…really not like people with mental health issues. They view even the smallest suggestion of making an accommodation no matter how minor as a great burden that they must “cater to”. 

I think that’s a very sad way to view other people, honestly. 

These people act like adding trigger warnings is this massive undertaking that they must shoulder to cater to sensitive people with unreasonable demands, but it’s really just…not. I have a degree in creative writing, and also attended many an open mic through that course (and still do), and content warnings are normalised as common courtesy when you’re sharing work at a workshop or reading and its not this awful, burdensome task; it takes all of half a minute to write a content warning at the top of the page, or mention before you start reading that your piece contains a common trigger. No one has ever kicked up a fuss about this, but arts people tend to be more accepting in my experience.

My concern is that these trigger warnings do not just warn, but end up shutting down entire topics and lines of discussion altogether

It is also very hard to define exactly the extent of what should be excluded and what not.

In the context of school and university students, what coursework, if any, should students be exonerated from?

Let' say that a student lost their parents in a terrorist attack, or in a bombing during a war. There is no doubt this event is traumatic. The student will probably not want to read, and understandably so, novels or detailed investigative journalism which narrate similar incidents in excruciating details.

But should this student be exonerated from any history class altogether? Can you learn history without learning about wars, bombings and deaths?

I don't have a clear answer, but I think the answer is far from straightforward.

It is also undeniable that society has gone too far with this. A British university placed a trigger warning on Chauser's works, warning of ""incidences of violence, mental illness and expressions of Christian faith"". I am not religious but I find a trigger warning about Christian faith laughable, and in fact a gift to the far right.  [https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/trigger-warning-placed-chaucers-works-9629213](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/trigger-warning-placed-chaucers-works-9629213)",""

They are ""trigger warnings"" so they aren't trying to stop you, they just want you to know what exposure there is so you can forecast triggers.

I had this problem recently with a manga called kemono jihen - I wont get into details but this lighthearted romp with superpowers children then suddenly without warning depicts someone's mother & years of forced reproduction by monsters - it chilled me to my bones and I feel physically sick thinking about it months later. Yet I've read much worse horror novels for fun since I was prepared.

Getting shocked like that is horrible - if you don't like trigger warnings I at least want you to realize that you have no idea what the feeling people are describing is - to you it's likely just a depiction that makes you feel gross/uncomfortable/etc as part of the authors intention - to those affected it isn't just sympathy, you viscerally experience emotions either as a flashback to trauma or some version of what the victims would be feeling. Its most problematic in public - getting hit with a wave of nausea/panic attack/memories against your will in a lecture or something is like getting flashbanged. The best example though extreme is what people did to PTSD - there are stories of kids dropping books behind the back of Vietnam vet schoolteachers for their reaction (including my father who is ashamed now) - they would try to hide, cry, act out, anything - and it affected them for a while. Imagine how cruel that is to do to someone? Yet if he HAD A WARNING like seeing the books fall in front of him he would be much less affected - that's the ""trigger warning""

The problem is the people arguing against them are starting in a bad faith argument to start with. And some authors arguing against them (not all but some) essentially are lazy and/or don't care about their readers.

I have PTSD surrounding quite a few things that happen in Dark Romance. I don't avoid it. UNLESS it's a bad mental health day. Trigger warnings help me with that. If I know a book is heavily SA (dub/non con falls under that for me) or even has it in it I'll avoid it on a bad day and read it instead on a good mental health day. I even have a book review concerning my PTSD and both an author AND a PA (I was on an ARC team) refusing to give me triggger warnings for a mafia romance book (because it would ""spoil the story"" spoiler: it wouldn't have) and how negatively it affected me. That was definitely one of my 1 star on goodreads/amazon reads (would have been negative stars if that was an option) not to mention even if i had been properly warned it would still be at best a 2 star for me. it just wasn't good.

SOME of us with the need for trigger warnings CAN read the books we just have to do it on good days for us. There's some that can't at all and they're so valid for it.

For me, it comes down to informed consent. Informed consent is a huge thing for me and telling me I should just expect every thing for dark romance for every book is wrong. because not all of them are the same (and honestly some of my favourite reads are dark romance) like, giving us the warnings is, as you said, like the viewer discretion warnings in front of media. They give us information to decide if we are in the right place to subject ourselves to it (or even if we want to).

Just because it’s written for adults doesn’t mean that only adults will read the book. I’ve been reading adult books since I was 13. I’ve been surprised by rape, incest, incestuous rape, graphically violent sexual acts with dubious consent, all kinds of violence, murder, suicide. Some of this was in mills and boon books where the existence of sexual content was obvious, or in horror where something gruesome and frightening is the point, but often as not it was in fantasy and literary fiction where it can just appear.

Now when I read the summary of the book and it comes with a content warning I can decide whether I’m ok reading about suicide or incest.

- they are obvious topics in that genre. Like do you really need a trigger warning for things like murder, abuse or other crimes in a thriller? Or things like cheating, stalking and manipulation in a dark romance? Or things like racism in a biography of a famous black person?
- they are way too specific/long. If you’re gonna tell me every little bad thing that happens, at least put it somewhere where I can easily skip it. Best if it’s not actually in the physical copy but online. Worst if it’s on the cover or blurb. 
- if it’s part of a bigger issue. I’m not super conservative but there are certain things that I find too ""woke"". Trigger warnings CAN sometimes be a sign that the author/the book is just not gonna be enjoyable based on their takes/their style etc. 
- if done with classics. I’m sorry but Shakespeare has been dead for a while, I’m sure you can find a summary online. Apart from the fact that the first point often applies too. If you decide to read a tragedy be prepared for something tragic. 

In general, I think people still need to be held responsible for their own actions. No you can’t demand trigger warnings in every life situation simply because you have an issue.

So... what then?  You don't address this.  The people with niche triggers deserve trigger warnings as much as anyone else.  Are you discriminating against them?

That’s because it’s not about trigger warnings, it’s about the culture war. With the push to be more kind, considerate and inclusive in society in the last couple of years, there’s also been a push back by people who rather than considering their behaviour and changing, prefer being outraged that they have to be considerate of others. And because they rely on outrage, they have to keep reacting more and more, so anything that shows consideration or kindness is considered woke and they react negatively to it. Trigger warnings is one of those things. Rather than having any concrete reasons for disliking them, they just decide that trigger warnings are bad and come up with reasons to justify that. Their opinions don’t make sense and often contradict each other because it’s not meant to make sense, because when you tell them why their reason is invalid, they’ll quickly switch to the next reason.

Hell, even knowing that a twist is coming, not even knowing what it is, fundamentally changes how you consume a piece of media.

I myself have a trigger! Inhalation. Not like choking, but actual inhalation, due to a medical emergency I had as a kid. Even just typing it out has me anxious as *fuck*. I watched Life one day, and the scene where the alien crawls down Ryan Reynold's throat and kills him from the inside is actual nightmare fuel for me. Would I want to repeat the experience of finding that out out of fucking nowhere in the middle of the film? *Not particularly*. But nobody else that enjoys horror should not have their enjoyment of the scenes be tainted by the fact that they need to broadcast in advance that there's a scene of asphyxiation/inhalation because one random guy in Australia has a ptsd trigger based on that shit.

I've had a few (horror) books in recent memory where I read them only to discover a fairly gut-wrenching part. Obviously my choice of genre is part of this, but even though I felt deeply uncomfortable, had I had a TW I might've avoided or skipped that experience altogether and, looking back now, I'm glad I was able to confront those feelings.

They're publishers. They publish. They decide what that publishing looks like. If a publisher wants to set the standard that their books will all contain trigger warnings, that's one of the things they get to decide. If you don't like it, you don't have to publish with them or read their books, but it's a weird stance to take about an accessibility tool. Do you also get upset when a venue decides to implement a quiet room for people experiencing sensory overload?

Feeling like a 600 lb gorilla is sitting on your chest, feeling like you just fell into a deep dark well with no way out,  sweating buckets, feeling like you are completely removed from a situation and watching from outside yourself among other reactions are not merely ""uncomfortable"" as you so inaccurately labeled it. 

That's like people who have never given birth describing it as ""uncomfortable."" Sorry, but I'm going to reiterate the part you completely and utterly missed. 

You do not decide what is and isn't uncomfortable for anyone other than yourself based on your own experiences of ""uncomfortable."" That's extremely self-absorbed. Do better. SMH. 

Don't argue with me. Go back and re-read. And if you still don't get it then stop reading and find someone who can explain to you why you and your subjective experience of ""art"" and ""uncomfortableness"" are not the world standard no matter what you want to believe.","lthx9it"

The issue is very much the word “trigger”. There is a psychological concept called priming, where exposure to certain cues can influence responses or behaviors. Using the phrase “trigger warning” literally psychologically conditions and suggests to people they should have a certain emotional reaction. So they do.

This coupled with overuse of these warnings in general really does condition certain people to have strong emotional reactions to mundane subject matter that they otherwise would not give a second thought towards.","lthy68x"

Bit of a personal story but I went through a bad miscarriage a few years back that ended me up in the hospital and afterwards I was displaying some signs of PTSD - it seemed like everywhere I went in fandom and on Kindle in the weeks following I just kept seeing trigger warnings for pregnancy, birth, miscarriage, child death etc and...it was just too much.

I had a notably worse reaction to the trigger warnings and how freakishly prolific they were than anything put to print and I HATED it so much. To this day I despise trigger warnings.

And the answer seems to be no. People with trauma don't make different choices about reading media in the presence of trigger warnings, and when they do get triggered, being forewarned doesn't seem to make them any less upset by the material.

It seems like what people really want is a warning about plot elements they personally won't like—things that could be sad or unpleasant, rather than clinically triggering. And at that point, I think the case for trigger warnings becomes much weaker. If a reader wants a list of all the sad things that happen during the story, to make sure the story isn't too sad, I get it, but that's different.

Just a way for people to choose to engage with material and if they do they at least aren’t surprised by it. Like people can’t see the title card on the screen saying a show has nudity, choose to watch it and then complain to everyone it has nudity in it. You were told, you knew what to expect and you chose to go forward with watching. 

I do think OP is being a little disingenuous with saying there’s no spoilers with warnings. If I had never heard of Old Yeller, and saw a warning that there’s animal death, I’m gonna know how it ends. And like others have mentioned I have also seen frivolous warnings (or what I consider to be frivolous) like fatphobia or swearing. Suicide is another one that often is a spoiler because you’re just left wondering who’s it going to be while reading. 

It still seems odd to me, since art can be used for catharsis. I imagine people ignore the warnings if they would potentially be triggered because they can engage with the topics in a safe way and can take breaks if needed. 

Either way, I don’t get why people make such a big fuss.

This is the part I’m most interested in and interestingly it’s summed up as basically irrelevant when the research suggests that there was a slight increase in avoidant behaviors when a person was presented with the choice of whether or not to engage with content containing a trigger warning.

Avoidance is defined as “trying not to think about the subject material that we forced you to read/watch” and *not* defined as “choosing to not engage with this piece due to reading a relevant trigger warning.”

As soon as you see it, you know exactly who is going to do it and why, which really dampens the impact of the moment on a first watch because it is such an unexpected escalation of the narrative.

But when my mental health is in the trash, certain trigger warnings are extraordinarily helpful to making sure that I don't engage with content that deepens whatever crisis I'm in.

"ltlwe8w","PokeLSouma","2024-10-25 00:45:43 UTC","What is important to note about this, though, is that is INCREDIBLY hard to do research around actual trauma in the way that is needed to look into trigger warnings, because you cannot just dump a very traumatic piece of media on somebody without any kind of warning. I listened to a podcast a while ago that featured one of the researchers who was looking into trigger warnings and she did mention that ""yeah so we had to go for images of a plane crash because you know, we had to find something upsetting but not TOO upsetting"" (paraphrased). So a lot of data we have is propably mostly built around scenarios that are closer to ""upsetting"" instead of ""triggering very intense lasting negative emotions"" (especially bc this is very specific and hard to design a study around tbh). 

If you look at the studies referenced here, the majority are very generic ""this story contains mentions of violence/sexual assault/suicide"" warnings, and if you follow trigger warning discussions within disability spaces, for example, a lot of people who rely on or ask for trigger warnings HEAVILY criticize those. Generic warnings don't help anyone, because they can mean ANYTHING and you don't know if it actually involves specific triggers. Specific trigger warnings like this are a lot less common, both irl and in research. And the lack of these specific trigger warnings could very well make it less likely for people to avoid content based on them, because we don't actually know if we will have a bad reaction to it.

They also point out specifically that they are focused on short-term effects. Triggering content for some people is not immediate, but something that builds up in you and takes hours to fully kick in, so some of these cases might just slip through the cracks. 

Non of this is to say that current research is wrong by any means, just that there seem to be quite a few gaps here that we don't yet know everything about, and so it's hard to say ""they don't work period"". Just that there are many cases where they don't. That said, I did not read all of the studies referenced here, and if any of what I said is addressed in any of them or any more recent work, I'd love to know so I can keep learning!

What that science says is merely that trigger warnings increase anxiety when a person to whom they're directed still reads the story. 

What trigger warnings are for is for people to be able to decide whether to read the story or not and deal with the triggers. If they decide to go ahead, it's entirely possible the anticipation heightens anxiety, but that's different from being triggered. But the main point is that they can also choose not to read it and deal with the trigger. In that case, anxiety is not heightened, and there is no harm done.

This is incredible nonsense, seriously, to claim this study says that trigger warnings are pointless or harmful.

The measured outcomes and methodology are preposterous and the actual measurements indicate that trigger warnings do exactly what they intend to - they allow people to make a choice about engaging with the material. I don't think the fact that people engage with the material after being warned is an indication that they're useless.  

The point was never to get people to not engage, the point is to let people know what they're getting into if they do. 

The results don't say that no one avoids material that contains trigger warnings, it says that some people do, they were mostly surprised by how many people *they expected to avoid the material* didn't. 

Not *everyone* had a worse reaction, some did. I'm not even sure how you can gauge that effectively considering the plasticity of the human psyche.

But the major issue with this study is that it didn't examine if any on this is actually helpful for recovery, only for their assumptions about what trigger warnings are for.

I'm a writer, and my books have had murder, rape, terrorist attacks, domestic violence, accidental death, alcoholism, etc. some of it detailed, some happening off page. At what level do those things need warnings? I wrote a nonfiction book of movie reviews, and I had someone tell me the book needed a trigger warning because I said that a movie had a rape scene. That really confused me, because if mere mention of rape requires a warning, wouldn't the trigger warning itself require a warning?

I've read some things that disturbed the hell out of me and upset me. I'm not mad at the authors. It was bad luck that I read something disturbing and upsetting. I said, ""Well, never gonna re-read THAT one,"" and went on with my life.

(On a facetious note, the best warning I ever saw in a book was for Christopher Moore's The Stupidest Angel, which said the book contained zombies, cannibalism, and ""people in their forties having sex."")","lthzlkk"

Unreading something is impossible, so I think trigger warnings shouldn't be something that you can bump into accidentally when opening the book and get your experience ruined. People that need to know if a book contains a certain topic can just google search it and find out.","lthv9d6"

We don’t need warning labels on everything in our life. It should be up to the person to do their due diligence and research something they’re about to get into. I agree about doing a quick google search for “book title + trigger warnings”.

"lthy5eu","Soluban","2024-10-24 11:55:34 UTC","Yeah, I agree. There's no reason to expect abuse, rape, murder,suicide, or whatever in just any book and knowing ahead of time that they happen can take away from the shock and emotional impact of those events occurring unexpectedly. They're meant to trigger strong emotional reactions, and if it's something a reader knows they can't handle, they need to go out of their way to find them before reading a book. I mostly listen to Audiobooks, and haven't run across trigger warnings, but if they prefaced something I was going into I'd be annoyed. 

I understand trigger warnings as someone who had a close relative commit suicide. It's not something I avoid, but I watched the show >!Preacher!< shortly after and one of the characters >!shot themselves in the face with a shotgun,!< and it definitely ""hit different"" in the near aftermath of having someone I was close to kill themselves in a similar way.","lthv9d6"

- TV shows, movies, and movie trailers include the “this content features depictions of X/Y/Z and is intended for mature audiences; viewers discretion is advised” warnings? 

- music performance videos contain epilepsy warnings? 

- photographs and videos on social media/news outlets are blurred out and/or come with a graphic content/nude content warning? 

Because if you don’t, I don’t see why this would be significantly different. Knowing that a book contains something like domestic violence doesn’t spoil anything critical in the story for you, and often tells you far less about the story than the blurb you typically read on the back. You don’t even know who the domestic violence happens to, who the abuser is, when the abuse comes up, how the abuse comes up, what the aftermath of the abuse is, how the abuse is described, etc., so I don’t see how the warning of domestic violence being featured would reasonably ruin the story for you.

That said, as someone who has experienced intense SI (>!suicidal ideation!<) during mental health crises, trigger warnings for s\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* are VERY important, because when experiencing SI, a person feels intensely connected to characters who are experiencing the same thing. It can deepen feelings of SI and even lead to committing the act. There is research that backs up this statement, which is why 13 Reasons Why was such an abomination of a show.

I don't know your experience, and if you were truly triggered by the things you listed, then this next bit is not relevant to your particular experience. That said, grieving and getting triggered are not the same thing. A trigger is based on some trauma that hooks directly into your nervous system and at its height can lead to panic attacks or other manifestations of extreme anxiety. Reminders of grief are tough as hell and can intensify sadness about that grief, and at the same time they do not inherently *trigger* someone.

I'll give an example that isn't as intense as the SI. People joking about having PTSD can be triggering for me when I'm in a mental health crisis, i.e. a time when I'm more prone to panic attacks/SI/crying seemingly out of nowhere. When I'm OK and hear those jokes, I find them distasteful but move on with my life. When I'm not OK, those jokes are intense reminders of what MY traumas actually are and the impact that they've had on me, and I can feel my heart racing, I start to sweat, I can't think because all of a sudden my brain has turned into mush, and I probably start tearing up from intense anxiety. I have to use distress tolerance skills such as immediately beginning intense exercise, taking an ice-cold shower, etc. to shock my body into a spot where I can start to think rationally again.","lti2ljb"
"ltj03zr","Vegtam1297","2024-10-24 15:36:07 UTC","First, I'm very sorry about your sister. That would be awful.

If scenes of suicide don't trigger you, that's good. Everyone is different. In your case, that's not a trigger, and you have others. In many people's cases, that is a trigger. 

The OP already addressed this point too in pointing out that trigger warnings in books doesn't mean a person is going to avoid addressing their PTSD. Avoiding this one specific instance of a trigger doesn't mean they want to avoid all instances. They often will be working on it in therapy. They are not trying to avoid emotions altogether or even the specific physiological/psychological reactions to triggers. They're just given the opportunity to make a choice in this one case.

I'm sorry you feel that trigger warnings make triggers appear to be simple. That's not their intent, and I don't think most people would agree with that. They address an issue that helps a lot of people.

There are no studies that back up the claim that trigger warnings have a net negative effect on people. All those show is that people who continue to read despite the TW have heightened anxiety while reading. That should be obvious. But the real point of the trigger warning is to give people the choice to read or not. If they choose not to, then the trigger warning was a positive for them.

This isn't about ""white coats"" trying to wrap the world in cotton. It's about helping people in one specific situation. Speaking to people who are healing or have healed is exactly why trigger warnings exist. Those people overwhelmingly tell you that trigger warnings are helpful. It's unfair and insensitive to paint those who benefit from trigger warnings as ""unable to face reality"".

Typical bad things (rape, violence, sexual assault, etc.) can easily be classified as triggering.

However it gets into a grey area with more nuanced issues.

Take your example from The Last of Us. I don’t typically consume content involving gay men. I have no problem with them, and if they show up in the story it doesn’t bother me, but it’s not in my normal interest range.

However if two men having such a relationship is triggering to someone you have to ask why?

Does the story involve graphic sex? Well, that could certainly be an argument for a trigger warning. Sex can be very triggering for those with trauma

However just two gay people existing? Well, now you’re blurring the line between not being someone’s interest and intolerance.

Trigger warnings shouldn’t be used to allow censorship due to intolerance.

Now I’m not saying that’s why you wouldn’t have watched it. But I do remember when that episode came out the absolute vitriol that showed up online.

Books and shows should absolutely have uncomfortable topics, that’s how we grow as individuals and society. People should be free to read or watch them without the topic being completely removed from access.

Certain topics should be restricted of course. For example children shouldn’t be exposed to content containing explicit sex or violence until they’re older. (When is “older” is a whole debate in and of itself.)

Why is preventing a PTSD episode not helpful, and why does this prevention annoy you? You clearly don't know anything about PTSD. A PTSD episode isn't something you ""walk away"" from.

>If you are bothered by certain things - and most of have encountered books we couldn’t read because they were disturbing or brought back terrible times in our lives - read the reviews and book summaries first to help you decide on questionable books.

Why should someone with PTSD/trauma have to spend so much effort to find trigger warnings if this information can be easily displayed on the book's website/store/etc?

Your words before and after this line suggest otherwise.

>PTSD isn’t treated by hiding from the world and the trauma that caused it. It’s treated by being open to the pain and learning to maneuver in the world despite it.

It's not up to you, random internet person, to decide how PTSD victims treat their trauma. Some don't even have access to proper mental health care.

I guess by that logic allergy warnings shouldn't exist, since allergic people should expose themselves to their allergies in order to get stronger, and if they get really sick then that's too bad.

I also think people vastly underestimate the use this can have for things like children's books. Instead of reading the whole book before letting your own kid read it, you could look at the content warnings to see if there's anything you need to talk to your child about first or that might mean your child isn't in a place to read that book.

Avoidance of a trigger is also demonstrated to make PTSD and the response to being triggered worse, and is the opposite of how psychologists try to treat it. In fact a book is a great example of a safe space where people can be exposed to a topic without coming to any harm and being in control as they read it.

It would be pretty unethical to perform a double blind randomized controlled experiment. “Let’s surprise people with PTSD with their triggers and see if they’re worse off”. Do you ask for proof that parental warnings at the beginnings of shows or movies are beneficial, or do you accept that it’s a tool that can be used to decide if the media is appropriate to a specific audience.

Honestly, I think it’s stupid to expect proof that people shouldn’t read what they don’t want to read. It’s a hobby most people are doing for enjoyment!

You’re telling on yourself a bit with your claim that including a content warning is the author mitigating someone else’s emotions for them. No, an author doing that would be deciding not to include content in their work out of fear for their audience’s emotions. A content warning is them being upfront about what’s in there so their audience can mitigate and manage their own emotions (decide whether or not they’re in a headspace to manage the difficult content).

If I said I was tired of reading about World War II would you suggest I blind buy Captain Corelli’s Mandolin and just put it down when I discover that’s what it’s about? Would you say putting World War II as a setting in the blurb is a spoiler and coddling me? Would it be “for my own good” to be forced to spend my leisure time reading something I don’t want to, regardless of my reason?

I don’t hear anyone saying trigger warnings should be mandated by the government.

I have been told to push through them, and tried to do so without the help of a therapist and psychiatrist. It only made things worse for me.

They have something from their past(I've never asked, and they've never volunteered) where their mental health will *crater* if they consume media where a character's significant other dies, especially suddenly. So my friend was watching Lost. Shannon's running around the jungle, Ana Maria's leading the group back toward the first side of the island, the whispers are rising, and then BLAM.

Any methodology of research that rounded up victims of sexual assault, for example, and then gave them a warning of books containing rape vs another option, and clocked the response would surely see a number of people traumatized by their experience steer away from the triggering content.

It could cause strong emotions, or feeling jumpy, on edge, or startled, it could look like freezing or dissociation. And that’s not an exhaustive list, it doesn’t look the same for everyone. While all of these things are generally considered uncomfortable (to say the least), I personally would describe them as more than just a sense of discomfort, but that’s sort of the point - someone else might find that an apt description for the symptoms they experience.

So (1) trigger warnings do not reduce the number of traumatized people who engage with a potentially triggering text, (2) trigger warnings do not reduce those people's distress if they do get triggered, and (3) trigger warnings create more distress in anticipation of being triggered.

What they were saying, If memory serves, was that seeing a trigger warning for the trauma they had experienced, put them back into that place of the trauma. So sometimes it would trigger an event - sometimes only after multiple exposures online. From the words themselves not the material. So they requested that the word be changed to a code word or abbreviated so they wouldn’t have to see the words describing their traumas. But if that was the case that code word would have to be changed periodically which isn’t applicable for printed materials.

Like I said, I have nothing against trigger warnings. I question their usefulness and how they affect people, but given that I’m not an expert I choose a fairly neutral position. If a compromise can be met where the people who want them can get them and benefit and the ones who don’t want them don’t have to see them, that’s a win/win in my book.

I think a 3rd party option would be optimal because then people could outright exclude certain terms and never have to engage with them. But I also understand the argument of having to seek something like that out.","ltimc9p"

The trigger warning for the next episode was one for stillborns. So I knew what was coming from that hospital trip.

I think that’s a very bad example though because with tv shows (especially soaps) you have prior context that you wouldn’t have prior to reading a book.

I think a good work around is to have a page before the books contents begin with a list of triggers included in the book, readers can read them if they believe they will benefit from it. I definitely would benefit from it and would want this to be the case. 

I think a lot of the people who are adamantly against trigger warnings tend to be bigots who associate the concept of “triggers” to be something created by and for LGBT people or anyone they would refer to as “woke”.

Research has shown that trigger warnings might not actually be that helpful. Simply because reading a trigger warning that a rape occurs in the story isn't much different than reading a scene that is leading up to a rape. Both options make you think about rape.

Books are also slow and most things are set up. It is very rare for a murder to suddenly happening out of the blue in a genre where you don't expect it.

With a TV or cinema you have to take actions that take some time to protect yourself. With reading it is an immediate action. You are in 100% full control. It is why we as a society are more comfortable with kids reading books above their age then kids watching movies above their age.

The comparison to flash lighting is a bit ridiculous. Knowing flash lighting is part of a performance is not in any way the same as knowing that someone is going to commit suicide in a book about depression. And while there is doubt over the benefits of trigger warnings there is no question about the idea that epilepsy warnings save lives.

I do know authors however who use trigger warnings as selling points for their books.  

Think about some of the best horror movies and books you've read. The unexpected, horrifying scene is what makes them so good. One book by Richard Laymon starts with two teen girls having a sleepover. The girl who lives in the house opens the bedroom door after hearing a noise and is immediately impaled. This is within the first couple of pages. The other girl escapes with the little brother of her friend. Her dad becomes the hero, saving both kids. In the final pages, just when you think, ""Okay, the kids are safe and the father will adopt the now parent-less child,"" the father hears a noise in the hall, goes to investigate and is hit in the chest with the boy's head.

Definitely a novel that could trigger many....but the unexpected horror that scene posed is what makes the book a novel above the rest. 

In another of his novels, the last few pages has a twist. A hero boyfriend saves the women, his girlfriend's mother, his girlfriend, and her sisters from a madman who has them trapped on a remote island in gorilla cages. By the end of the novel, when you think he's going to let the women go, freed from their sadistic rapist/torturer, you learn he's now insane because of the trauma he went through saving them, and he decides to keep them where they are. 

I think with horror, the expectation is that something horrifying will happen. Thus, I don't use trigger warnings.","ltpawe7"

The way to break that sort of conditioning is to slip new information past their defenses. But that will never happen if all information comes with bright flashing warning signs attached.

It's not even all about the violent bigots, either.

As per my example with *The Last of Us* above, anybody can be prone to dodging new perspectives, and some of those can be quite enlightening.

For a more targeted example, say you've got someone who has an extreme distaste for sexual assault/abuse topics. With the appropriate warnings applied, they can easily avoid even a drop of that from crossing their eyeballs. But what if said sexual context isn't violent rape, like most people assume it is? What if the moment in question is Uncle Steve asking eight year-old Becky to ""give me a little turn in that cute little dress of yours"". More subtle moments like that can lead to invaluable learning experiences.

With warnings in place, Susan says to herself ""I know all about rape, I've taken self-defense classes. I protect myself. I don't need to read anything about it"", and she leaves the book on the shelf.

Yes, definitely at least 2 students per semester were triggered by something.  However, when I gave trigger warnings, people were very unlikely to leave the room.  When someone was triggered by something, sometimes we'd talk about it one on one, but other times they were comfortable staying in the room and sharing their experience in class discussion.


On the other hand, the times I forgot to give appropriate trigger warnings, multiple people would leave the room, and even when they came back, they weren't emotionally engaged anymore. 


Generally, the people most triggered were the people who had a life experience with suicide that aligned closely with the details of one of the roleplays or scenarios.  These weren't people who were trying to get out of engaging with something challenging, they were people who didn't expect the scenario we were going to discuss would be someone with the same name and suicide method as their family member who died by suicide.


I wish it was a standard part of teacher training to learn about the window of tolerance.  If someone gets triggered in your class and you're not prepared, they will usually quietly zone out for the rest of the class, in which case, they aren't learning anything.


I've already made my point, but I'm going to address your example of Where the Red Fern Grows.  You have no idea what someone's life is - they may have witnessed their own dog run over by a car.  If I were using that book in class, I would offer the trigger warning, and if anyone objected to the book, I would ask them to read the first 2/3, so they could participate in class discussion about it.  Then, instead of reading the graphic ending, I would ask them to write a short paper about the relationship between the boy and his dogs, and why it developed that way.  It's not necessary to discard the book entirely, and it's also not necessary to force everyone to finish it, unless the lesson the teacher is trying to teach is compliance to authority rather than literary analysis.","ltihhhm"

One of my pet peeves is people who refuse to watch the news and avoid any topic that makes them slightly uncomfortable. For instance, both my mother and stepmother will leave the room or change the channel at the slightest mention of the holocaust. Like if someone from WWII is featured on CBS Sunday Morning in an ultimately uplifting story but there are some photos and descriptions of a concentration camp they will refuse to listen to that story. 

I think, in some cases, people should force themselves to listen to hard things. Neither of these women are Jewish, have Jewish friends or family, nor have ever known anyone even remotely connected to a Nazi camp nor anything even in the same universe as such a harrowing experience. But it’s an uncomfortable topic that they don’t like to think about. Understandable, but I think it’s a disservice to people who endured hard things to not listen to their stories, to ignore it and pretend like it never happened. 

They don’t have any ptsd and they’re in no way “triggered” by this content, it’s just easier to ignore it, but keeping yourself in a Pollyanna bubble at all times is not a good way to live, I don’t think. Ignoring injustice doesn’t make it go away. Terrible things need to be exposed. Not hidden.

But putting the warnings on everything starts to normalize the *idea* of these warnings being needed,  and that normalizes the idea that its common to use them, and that normalizes the idea that its okay to not read or hear uncomfortable things if you don't feel like it.

Being able to distinguish fiction from reality, and your own experience from hearing about someone else's is important.  It's important to be able to handle yourself in the world.  The choice that trigger warnings offer doesn't exist in most parts of life, so being taught and conditioned to rely on them is setting oneself up for failure.

For some people its easy to separate experience from memory, thought, or imagination.  And for a very small group it's almost impossible.   And in the vast gray zone in-between sits most people who actively need to develop the capability to some degree.  And sending social signals that tell them they don't need to work on that because we're going to bubble-wrap the world is doing a huge disservice to them.  They're avoiding short-term anxiety and in turn, become more anxious in general.

"ltnctjw","Scared_Tax470","2024-10-25 07:26:36 UTC","Ok, but from an educational perspective, this sounds like it's the teacher's job to ""challenge"" students emotionally, going back to the OP's point. As someone in education, do we really think that all teachers are able and prepared to care for their students' psychological safety while doing that? In an ideal world, yes, but in this world, obviously not. In an ideal world teachers would be better trained in socioemotional skills, vetted (and compensated), and this would be part of the curriculum. But who is doing a unit on something disturbing and actually using it to support students to explore uncomfortable feelings and process them? IME the idea is more ""here is this important and disturbing book"" and even worse, some half baked activity asking students to imagine themselves as the victims of genocide or enslavement. Content warnings are meant to be used for specific things so ideas can be introduced in a different way, not to avoid an entire education unit. People can still learn about significant events without having to read graphic descriptions. There is no single piece of literature that's so important that is worth traumatizing a student. That's not learning or being challenged in an effective way. Some students also DO have trauma responses that are going to be negatively affected by the material, and it should not be entirely left up to the teacher, who is usually not trained in how to deal with that kind of situation. Let alone the teachers who push it intentionally to take students out of their comfort zones-- students are a vulnerable population, they're already uncomfortable constantly. They don't need to be forced into being challenged by someone who doesn't know their mental health history. We can't even get rid of bigotry in classrooms, why would we think classrooms are a safe space to challenge uncomfortable emotions?! 

To be clear, I'm not saying don't teach the uncomfortable stuff, I'm saying 1) train teachers better in how to present it and work with it flexibly and compassionately, 2) keep content warnings and just deal with the fact that that's what comes with respecting young people's autonomy and mental health.","ltihhhm"

We never know what other peoples circumstances are really like (sometimes, the abuser is in the classroom itself) so the only real answer of how to proceed is to create student advocacy associations (or something similar) and go from there.

Student advocacy is a necessity for general accessibility regardless. My university has had to standardize presentations to some degree due to repeated student complaints about reading difficulties due to the use of hard to read fonts, lack of contrast between text and background, and that was only possible because some students got together and requested it via our student welfare group.

Students learning to analyze feelings of discomfort is a good thing, but at the same time, unpacking lifelong traumas in a group of judging peers isn't necessarily good or appropriate, y'know? It's a matter of an environment being designed for their success.

"ltj4goj","ConCaffeinate","2024-10-24 15:57:40 UTC","There's a world of difference between ""uncomfortable themes"" and a specific topic that is genuinely *psychologically triggering* to someone suffering from PTSD. A fellow librarian who worked in a high school library asked me for a recommendation for a replacement title for one of the required texts because a student with PTSD had a terrible experience when the English teacher decided it was a good idea to read a violent rape scene out loud in class. You know, because that would ""help"" make the """"uncomfortable theme"""" easier to process. 

Instead, she made a survivor mentally relive the most horrific experience of her life in front of her classmates. The student had no idea this scene was in the book, so she had no way to request to be excused from the reading, or even mentally prepare herself. *That* is why trigger warnings are necessary. 

The idea that ""everyone"" is ""seeking some type of anxiety or PTSD accommodation to avoid reading material,"" and that instructors are therefore ""sanitizing"" their required texts is absolute nonsense. I say this as a librarian, former instructor, and someone with anxiety/PTSD that received disability accommodations from multiple universities. Getting even the most basic accommodations was an uphill battle. It would have been a waste of time and effort to try to arrange alternatives for every required text with difficult themes. And you know what? I wouldn't have wanted or needed to! Because triggers are extremely specific to each individual, and someone who struggles with mentions of, say, child abuse, might have no trouble with mentions of violence in other forms. 

Trigger warnings are a valuable tool for those who need them. If bad actors try to use them to get books banned, then it's our duty as librarians to figure out better strategies for defending against these attacks.

Saying instead “Today’s topic will be about animal abuse” is warning enough that what’s going to be discussed is difficult.  No further content warnings should be needed since the blurb of the class indicates it.

I just posted above that my partner lost a son on the day he was born.   

If he was given a trigger warning that a film or book contained the death of a newborn, or a set of jokes about dead babies **of course** he would have increased anxiety about it.   Hell, sitting beside him, I'd have increased anxiety about it for him.   That is normal and a benefit of the TW - should we not wish to be exposed to that, we can move on to something different, and less anxiety inducing. 

Furthermore, I believe many people do accept their trauma as part of who they are.  I'm a survivor of SA, my partner is a father of three with two children, and I don't believe that there should be a negative connotation attached to that whatsoever.  It takes trauma survivors a long time to come to terms with things that happen, and they don't do it by suggesting that it's not at least a part of who they are.  It is, and it takes strength to acknowledge that and navigate it in a healthy way.   

Anxiety about triggering content is a normal response and one people should be given the opportunity to digest should they so choose.  No one is being protected by having their trauma sprung on them for entertainment.

And it's not up for anyone other than the trauma survivors themselves to determine whether it's good or bad if their trauma is a part of their identity.

That's weird, because that's not what I read about PTSD, or what my therapist say. You can treat PTSD perfectly while avoiding reading or watching rape scenes in fiction. You can talk about it, talk with your therapist, even in control settings with other survivors, but not wanting to see rape in fiction it's not avoidance behavior.

The point was never to ""encourage avoidance"" and according to the rest of the study, it doesn't actually do that anyway. 

If someone engages with it and they have a negative reaction, at least they were prepared for it.  The process of working through trauma isn't simple and negative reactions will happen whether you're warned or not, the fact that you receive a negative reaction could be a good thing.

Trauma is personal and establishing controls for this sort of thing is difficult yet essential and I'm not convinced they did this in any way that makes sense.

These studies provide statistics, often one time statistics. For example, if someone who is deemed ""should be avoiding this trigger"" reads it and has a bad reaction, do they avoid it in the future? Do they have a better reaction the next time? Do they, years later regret reading it? 

These studies barely skim the surface of the utility of trigger warnings.

If you want my opinion, I think having warnings on the inside back cover or the last page of a book is a nice compromise between people who wish to know if they'd get triggered and people who don't wish to be spoiled. You don't see them immediately, and if you need them, you don't need to do any extra work to find them other than flipping the book to the last page. For online purchase, have a section in the store with them under the book which isn't automatically open but can be with a click of a button. Problem solved. As for whether they should or shouldn't be there regarding people's mental health, I'll leave that for the people suffering from conditions which can get triggered. Coming from a pretty healthy mindset and giving myself the right to dictate if someone should be facing their phobias through accidental exposure to their triggers is so beyond condescending and entitled that I have no words for those in this post who are arguing for it. 

What I wanted to point out with my post is that triggering trauma is not necessarily the only reason why people might like to have a warning. I genuinely love Wuthering Heights now, and I'd have loved it at age 17 too just as much if I'd known what it was like going in. But I didn't, because it's been sold as one of the great love stories of Victorian times, and so I ended up hating it for ten years. Or take the example of 'It ends with us' movie - Blake Lively got rightfully criticized for selling it as a love story, when it's in fact a badly done story about domestic abuse, which ended up being triggering for scores of women who'd lived through such life situations and who'd have thought twice about seeing it if they knew to expect a heavy subject that's close to their heart (and there are MANY victims of domestic abuse in the world). 

But maybe I'm used to tags of this type because I read a lot of fanfiction and AO3 is built on tags. In a sea of fanfics for any given fandom, tags (trigger warning or just general topic/genre tags) help me decide what to read. I've never felt spoiled for any plot when checking them out, and for those authors who might wish to not spoil the surprise plot twist such as a major character death (which is otherwise one of the mandatory four tags), there's the fifth option of 'author chose not to use archive warnings', which means 'enter at your own risk'. People exclude those stories just in case if they feel they must exclude any of the other warnings, but fanfiction - and I think reading fiction in general, whichever format it comes in - is meant to be a pleasure activity. We all have very limited times in our lives to enjoy pleasure activities. Why is it scorned if we want to be able to curate that, so that we don't feel like we've wasted time with something we might not enjoy?","ltjb3u3"

And when I'm listening to rap or reading a book that's so obviously about racism (like huck finn) I'm not as upset because I expect it. So if anything, I'd probably enjoy a book more if they gave me a head up, I could mentally prepare.

That being said, I consume those medias sparingly. Plus I've read books about racism that don't say the n word and are more effective to me than the ones that use it. Just my opinion 🤷🏿‍♀️.","lti8lek"

Essentially trigger warnings can be used to self censor from trauma, but they can also be used to censor from sensitive topics and that can be good or bad depending on how it’s used.

Also: NHS mental health professionals are so *entirely* unbothered by whether I engage or not, that while I was completely willing to, I never actually got any treatment for trauma/depression (the latter I had asked about), and ended up discharged (after treatment for my OCD).

Now you have a student sitting in the classroom, and you bring this question up and they argue.  Now you have a whole classroom who have had to reflect on why they do or do not think something was rape and they got a working example of how their own definitions of consent and rape vary and what implications does this have in real life?  

I havent read it in decades but it wasn't a violent scene iirc - however you can't have that discussion if you have a sexual violence trigger warning on the class and an alternative assignment could be requested because of that. 

(not a classic but I can't think of a classic example at the moment) Lovely Bones? Very graphic scene.  While someone might be aware that rape is scary or bad, confronting that from a victim's POV can lead to a broader and truer understanding.  This can be important for empathy development and emotional intelligence.  Also, discussions on how it impacts the story telling, theme, etc are important on an academic level.  Critical review.

*Irreversible* is really, really hard to watch but everything from the sound, to the lighting, to the timing played a part in making it hard to watch - and how that was done was fascinating and why it impacts us so is more fascinating, and France's laws on how they handle nudity in filming is more fascinating in another way and why those laws exist...Such important critical things and I would've never picked up that movie or Tess or Catcher if someone hadn't assigned it. 

Understanding real, horrible things plays a very important part in our development but even the fake horrible things have a place too and yeah slapping a label on it makes it seem like it should be normal to need it and not that we need to find to see the bad and uncomfortable in the world because we have to be able to deal with it in our own realities.","ltjjn9c"

"ltj66p4","Cessily","2024-10-24 16:06:19 UTC","Disability Support, Student Government, and peer advisors etc were all under my purview. I completely understand the font thing and worked with academic affairs, the library, etc to have accessible materials in many, many different ways. I'm familiar with standardization and balancing accommodations with academic integrity. 

My issue was that as an educator, I understood the value of uncomfortable themes in literature. The classroom is not a therapy group, no one is expecting anyone to unpack trauma, and I understand a sexual violence survivor might struggle with their feelings as they read Tess of the D'Urbervilles... And they should address those feelings and their experience reading the text in their personal therapy process. 

However, when the accommodation requests come pouring in for an alternate assignment because a student has received an accommodation for anxiety or ptsd from surviving sexual violence the instructor is more likely to remove the reading. The discourse on trigger warning spurred a large uptick on this type of accommodation request and I saw a lot of sanitization happen in syllabuses and course content. It used to be relatively rare to have a content accommodation and when I first started in higher education most of those content accommodation requests came from religious reasons and were denied by the university. One instructor, I TAed for provided an alternative assignment for a difficult movie he had them watch as part of a final even though the review committee said it wasn't required - but it was the final and he didn't want fussing over the issue to delay grade postings.

Another response I saw happen in the classroom was in things like the myth of Callisto .. maybe just skip or sanitize that part to not deal with the problematic issue that is part of that myth (mythology is full of problematic material) even though the myth pops up in other classical works and we skip why it might be relevant because we don't want to deep dive because once you approach the topic...well...

Professors are also there to teach their subject matter, which they are experts. They are not therapists (well some are but not most). Students turning exposure into challenging themes into ""processing personal trauma"" also had an impact on my faculty. 

And on my office. Every report of sexual violence has to be reported, no matter the age, and reviewed by the Title IX coordinator. A lot of our interventions were having the difficult discussion with students that classrooms were not group therapy, assignments are not personal journals, and that there were resources where they could unpack the situation in a more appropriate setting. 

I'm not blaming trigger warnings for all of this, I'm saying you had the same misconception as many students that approaching challenging material in a classroom meant you had to work through your response in the classroom. The classroom is not the place for that work. It is an environment for academic discourse. I don't want anyone processing their complex trauma in the classroom because no one is adequately prepared to deal with it. 

Again I don't necessarily know that there is a right answer to this question. I know we can't and shouldn't sanitize the world, I do believe in accommodation, and I'm open to arguments for and against. 

It's complex and I recognize there is no easy answer but I do believe the topic is more nuanced than OP presented, but also more complex than the library's or academia's experiences.","ltiwc3l"

Edit: Title IX, behavior invention, conduct, etc were all under me - Im familiar with accommodation and how unique each situation is

In my experience there was large upticks (not everybody) in accommodation and alternate assignment requests and many of my faculty, program chairs, and deans sanitized syllabuses and course content in response. 

I ended my career at a large state funded institution, I am not sure if the smaller private universities I started my career experienced similar trends but it felt that way from discussions with other professionals at conferences and such. 

Of course, not all universities.

I've detailed my thoughts in other comments, I do recognize the difference and again when I started my career those requests were rare and they were easily accommodated when appropriate (I thought) although many were denied.

Administration issues and distrust between the faculty and leadership I'm sure played into less trust and the response to sanitize versus constructive discourse on ways to handle the uptick when trigger warning discourse became mainstream. 

It was always in our higher ed circles but it now is a common Internet discussion and popularity presents a new dynamic in both good and bad ways. 

I will never not encourage someone to research content concerns if they are aware there is an issue, I will never not censor a faculty member who handles traumatic material in an insensitive fashion (I'm out of education now but it wouldn't stop me from telling faculty they exhibited zero emotional intelligence if I was aware).

How shitty is it to tell someone who has survived sexual assault that they support trigger warnings because they want to filter by content? You don’t know me from Adam, just like you don’t know all of the other people who might benefit from trigger warnings. I shouldn’t have to discuss that experience to justify having empathy for others.

im not. but someone who is feeling discomfort and someone who has real trauma are not the same. I am not the judge of who is or who isnt. but the distinction remains and each case should be handled differently. my empathy does not extend to people that are crying wolf. i.e. people who say that they have been triggered angrily when in reality someone who has been triggered would likely not even respond but be suffering some physical or physiological effect.

>I’m fully capable of sorting by genre, but typically “rape” and “sexual assault” and “family/domestic violence” are not genres you can filter by.

my point was that even if it's not currently possible, this is a better solution that we can look into for people who do not have actual trauma.

>TW being included in a text doesn’t have to affect you AT ALL, yet you’re still out here being insulting to try to prove your point.

Fixed that to reflect the way I see it, in general. I *have* read books that I would describe as fatphobic(I don't like the term problematic in part because I think it's better to be specific - *what* is problematic about it? you can't discuss it beyond ""book bad"" if you're not willing to name the problem...in this case, that it perpetuates fatphobia). For example, one of Nnedi Okorafor's books, just recently(though it was a re-release of an older title of hers, which might explain the content), shocked me with how fatphobic and even ableist her depiction of the antagonist read as. Authors don't CW for that, though, because they're either unaware of the implications what they've written or they don't care.

But a book that *perpetuates* fatphobia is not necessarily the same thing as a book which *depicts* fatphobia(these are the ones that sometimes get CWs, because the authors are aware of the issue and trying to treat it with respect), which is where the nuance comes in. But I agree that a lot of it gets lost in the discourse. Nobody wants your nuanced take that comes down between the two sides. They want an easy yes or no, good or bad, we stan this author or we throw them off the tower.

But yeah, I don't see a CW as calling out ""problematic"" content. I see a CW as an indication that the author has put thought into their depiction of the content and its potential impact on others, which is a very non-problematic thing. Anyone who reads down a list of CWs and calls the book bad based on a list of disclosures about what it mentions is being just as ridiculous as the moms for liberty types who challenge books based off the one-page summaries on their parental review websites. At least read the damn thing first, and then if you still think it's bad we can have a meaningful discussion about how it handles it's themes and plot/character elements.","ltkev4w"

"ltp985j","Buster_Cherry","2024-10-25 15:52:45 UTC","Au contraire, I seek out the hardest content warning as a way to validate if an R Rated movie (horror gore, comedy raunch, romance sex scenes, etc) actually contains the content I would hope a genuine genre portrayal claims to have. 

What's annoying is the for Netflix, the content warnings are per season instead of episode and horrifically misguided or inaccurate. Rising Impact had gore? The show is a soft PG at worst!","ltk8bnw"
"ltkf0fs","Hypothesis_Null","2024-10-24 19:48:41 UTC","That's a really good question.  It occured to me that the parental advisory ratings *are* a form of warning, and yet no one objects to them.  So is that hypocritical or is there a fundamental difference at play?  But i didn't want to make my comment longer than it was.

I think there are a few significant differences between these and trigger warnings for a book or lecture.

First off, the difference in media.  Having a scenerio described in words or text on page is significantly different from a quasi-1st hand witnessing of horrific things with direct audio and video.  In terms of creating persistent memories, the seperation provided by text or speech is significant.  I generally agree with warnings of graphic footage, *particularly* if it's real rather than manufactured.  I don't think we should ever be completely numb to bad things that don't happen to us, and so the fact vs fiction filter is necessary.

Second, these are understood to the public in the context of advisory notices for *adults* to judge for their *children*.  The warning is never meant for the person reading it - it's always for someine *else*. So there's no social context or endorsement that it's common or normal (for adults) to personally *avoid* something based on that warning. Just to shield others and particularly the non-adults.

Third, these warnings are aimed at children to restrict them from something by someone else's judgement, and they tend to produce a rebellious attitude.  Rather than encouraging fragility and to avoid things 'too mature' it acts more as a challenge and motivation to push yourself and to experience things other people think you shouldn't. Think of kids sneaking into pg13 rated movies, or making fun of kids whose parents won't let them play the latest M-rated Videogame.

So, I'd consider them seperate because 1) the first-hand nature of the medias where these advisories are common makes the mental separation more difficult and less desirable than the second-hand media where trigger warnings are common. And 2) the social target and context of the advisories as presented seems to be benign or even beneficial in encouraging self-exposure to uncomfortable topics, rather than encouraging avoidance of them as trigger warnings seem to.","ltk8bnw"
"lto9g0n","Scared_Tax470","2024-10-25 12:33:37 UTC","Sure, I generally agree with you here. I've just never actually seen content warnings being used (/abused) the way people so vehemently complain about them. I believe it happens, but like you said, I don't think 1-2 students per semester is actually a problem. And professors sanitizing material is another whole problem entirely--the point of warnings is so you don't have to sanitize anything. If there's a graphic description, it can usually be summarized so the student can still engage with the ideas and nothing is lost. In the ""worst"" case there's one or two ideas that the student can't engage with at all, but I don't think that's a huge loss when you think about how much ""challenging"" material the average human doesn't engage with over the course of their education--not even considering the challenging parts of history that aren't taught at all.  And especially considering that it's usually because the student has *too much* experience with that particular challenging topic, it's not *that* student who needs to be challenged in that area. The average student --heck, even the best student-- is not absorbing 100% of the learning materials presented to them, and we know that students learn better when they are actively engaged and motivated to learn about a topic. So I just think it's weird to focus on some very small % of students not being able to engage with a very small % of material. Deciding who is essentially faking it to get out of the assignment is a different question, but I also suspect that that's not as big of a problem as people make it out to be, and strikes me a bit like anything else--isn't it better to provide something good for people who need it, even if there will always be a few who abuse the system? If you read about the experiences of people actually using content warnings (in fact I prefer the term ""content notes""), people aren't necessarily using them to totally avoid the material. They're using it to decide whether they're up for it at that particular time, and to prepare for it. It gives people the autonomy and the chance to use the tools they have to engage with challenging material rather than forcing them into it and taking them by surprise.","ltnzjh2"
"ltjfooh","Sisyphus_Monolit","2024-10-24 16:53:37 UTC","\\> I'm not blaming trigger warnings for all of this, I'm saying you had the same misconception as many students that approaching challenging material in a classroom meant you had to work through your response in the classroom. The classroom is not the place for that work. It is an environment for academic discourse. I don't want anyone processing their complex trauma in the classroom because no one is adequately prepared to deal with it.

  
Being requested to confront something, no matter whether the setting is therapeutic or academic, IS asking them to process trauma. Someones academic or professional beliefs are very rarely seperated from their personal ones. People will read the material, and they're going to stew in the emotions of it for good or ill.

The only thing that I can think of to avoid potential student breakdowns is for the first module of the subject to be about dissociating personal feelings and experiences from objective ones — which still isn't so easy. What if the student(s) simply can't do it? Do they drop the class? Drop out of the program entirely? In my country, the credit system does not exist, meaning there's no way to replace that class; students simply have to take it, and they suffer for it frequently.

Intellectualizing trauma can be a useful tool, but that's a difficult thing to teach, and I don't believe that the average lit teacher has the skillset required. On one hand, educators shouldn't be asked to fill a position beyond their scope. On the other, it's an inevitability that triggering material will trigger someone.

I understand the concern of sanitizing material leading to undermining the usefulness of the entire class/problem, and I'm absolutely with you on that one. Some people absolutely bow out of unpacking problematic media like Lolita because of the subject matter makes them uncomfortable. That it's written that way on purpose doesn't change their feelings about it - they're adamant that it's 'bad' media, and should be condemned to a vault forever. There's a very recent cultural issue about how ""consuming problematic media makes you a bad person"" which annoys me to no end. Over the last few years, I've been confronted with nauseatingly anti-intellectual takes on the subject, so I understand entirely where you're coming from.

However, there's no easy way to force that demographic of people to use their brains that doesn't wind up harming students with special needs. Lenience towards absences and alternate assignments would probably do a lot of work there. Making those things require authorization would be just as complex, since it would involve deciding who's trauma is legitimate or not.","ltj66p4"

That said, being against the use of deadly force (which I am also against it.) would be an issue with the military in general and shouldn't be taken out on individual soldiers, many who are working jobs that have nothing to do with combat. 

The vast majority of soldiers will never point a weapon at anything other than a paper or metal target. For the US military only about 10% will ever go into combat. 

Plenty of soldiers also feel conflicted about the use of deadly force. 

The military also provides humanitarian aid. The national guard in particular provides aid during all kinds of disasters. The coast guard as well. 

I always assumed that when people thanks members of the military for their service it isn't because of the likelihood of using deadly force, but more due to the rights and freedoms soldiers give up while serving. 

That said, from my own personal experience, I have never actually talked to anyone in the military who likes or wants to be thanked for their service. Many just want to be left alone. And for the VA to stop messing their records up and treating veterans like subhuman beings. 

Obviously there are those that enjoy being thanked. The loud individuals that want to be the center of attention and have their egos stroked. To each his own I suppose.

"ltlyywo","Catladylove99","2024-10-25 01:01:17 UTC","I get what you’re saying, I guess I’ve just rarely if ever been surprised by something like that in a book. I read literary fiction, so maybe it’s more of a problem in other genres? But I feel like the general tone and content of most books is clear enough without a specific trigger warning, and if something does show up that I wasn’t expecting, I can put it down as soon as I realize (assuming I’m not up for that topic in that moment) and pick up a different book instead. 

I don’t actually find trigger warnings helpful anyway, personally. For example, the last time a book seriously triggered me was this scene in Demon Copperhead involving an adult abusing a child. I’ve read so many books full of all kinds of child abuse, including some that were way, way more graphic and disturbing than this one, and been absolutely fine. But this scene mirrored my own particular experience in ways that just took me instantly back to that place. There’s no warning for that. A general “TW: child abuse” or whatever would not have prepared me in the slightest, because that’s not anything that normally bothers me. At any rate, once I started to respond that way, I took some deep breaths to re-regulate myself and decided to continue reading. It was rough, but I got through the scene and I’m enjoying the book. If I’d been in a less stable place, I could have chosen to put the book down and not continue reading. And let’s say the book *had* had a “TW: child abuse” in it? All I think that would have done would be to make me a bit more anxious and fearful the next few times I came across that particular TW, probably needlessly so, since I think it’s very unlikely I’ll react that way to anything else anytime soon. 

It’s my experience that triggers for a lot of people tend to be very specific and personal in ways that make trigger warnings pretty useless (as long as we’re talking about actual clinical triggers and not just things that people find upsetting). Besides that, my healing (and getting to the point where I could manage a trigger and continue reading the scene and be okay) has depended on *not* thinking of myself as being too fragile to confront my triggers or handle whatever comes up. In the real world, triggers are unavoidable, and when they appear, you can’t just close the book or turn off the TV or whatever. You have to have coping mechanisms. Building those coping mechanisms requires starting small and confronting triggers in safer/more manageable settings. Books are fantastic for this. 

All that said, I understand it takes time, so I get why some people just starting out might want to look up trigger warnings online in order to avoid triggers they’re not ready for. I’m glad those resources exist for those who want them. But I’m adamantly against including trigger warnings in the books themselves, which I think is infantilizing and stigmatizing to people with mental health issues and is also an invitation, intended or not, to censorship and book banning.

It's strange to me also how you can take a quantity like 55% and say that since 45% of the people aren't seeing rainbows and butterflies then it's a failed experiment.

In other words, the fact that most people didn't avoid it and some people that didn't avoid it has worse reactions means that some people did avoid it and some didn't have worse reactions.

Also, if a person has to Google every book, they are likely relying on other readers to mention those triggers in reviews. 

A single sentence or 3 in the front of a book or at the end of a blurb that gives a heads up ensures that every reader is able to make an informed decision. If the reader doesn't need that, they can skip it and dive into the story without a care. For those who need that heads up, it can literally save them from a severe exacerbation or mental health episode. 

I read to escape or learn or grow. I don't need every book to be comfortable or fluffy or happy. I don't even want that honestly. I want a diversity of experiences. 

Reading gives me an extremely safe space to confront my triggers on my terms. Being able to do so on my terms requires that heads up so that I can make an informed decision as to whether or not I'm in the right head space for it. Simply knowing ahead of time that those triggers are present can be enough to prevent it from triggering me.

"ltjnloi","Cessily","2024-10-24 17:32:34 UTC","Its actually two separate topics that intersect but I realize I left a lot unsaid in my familiarity with the topic!

It is not for me to say whether students need the accommodations or not, only to make sure the policy is followed and find a way to provide the student with what they need while respecting academic integrity.  Yes, we reduced barriers to accommodations during my career in an effort to create less burden on higher risk students.  Yes, there was exponentially more students receiving accommodations.  For example, you mentioned the more time for ADHD students.  Anxiety could be another disorder that receives more time, but also ESL students, TBI students, and PTSD was a common one for a variety of executive function accommodations.  

A good accommodation is unique to the student and the learning environment so not all ADHD, TBI, or anxiety students would receive extra time or receive it for every class but honestly the administrative overload has reduced a lot of colleges to just treating it like a flow chart where certain words unlock certain accommodations and it gets applied unilaterally across the campus. 

That is its own separate issue. Now trigger warnings...

Academia and student services have always had the discussion about problematic and traumatic  material in the classroom.  Thales of Miletus probably had an opinion (I kid, I kid).  When trigger warnings became a mainstream concept, there was a sharp uptick in accommodation requests for alternate assignments related to trigger warnings or course content.   

Every place handles alternate assignment requests in their own way.  At the beginning of my career a content accommodation was usually a religious request but some were because the generally couldn't interact with the content of the material.  Some universities don't require accommodation services for this type of request, as it is seen by some as a one-off the instructor handles with appeal rights to some review board but some do require it run through support services to ensure consistent handling. From a risk management/legal standpoint handling something that requires discretion consistent but wrong is almost better than inconsistent and right. Again another issue for another day. 

Anyhow when trigger warnings entered the general public scene we saw accommodation requests for trigger warnings on all material, automatic alternate assignments for certain trigger warnings, and even the total avoidance of certain ""triggers"" in the classroom experience all together which could include classroom discussion so you not only could get alternate reading but the instructor couldn't have a classroom review/discussion on the material you didn't read.  

How Victorian themes of sexual violence related to feminism? Are you going to even bother developing that section if you will have to alternative assignment out the whole unit because now you have 2-3 students each semester instead of 1 every handful of years?  

Again, we were aware that there was difficult and challenging and possibly traumatic material being taught and were used to the common complaints and requests - and were used to navigating it.  This was a much larger issue and compliance is a lot trickier.  

For accommodations that aren't one off assignments, it is more likely they have to do the official route - the official route which had lower barriers to better serve students and it isn't our place to say whether they do or don't need this accommodation.  

Trigger warnings, aren't the whole issue, it is bigger than that and very, very complex.  However, they are a tool that has been weaponized in a way.  A scalpel was developed to help but it can still do a lot of damage, you know? A warning at the beginning of text starts needlessly providing a separation that could become an issue - and a lot of academic administration where I worked started removing anything that could have a trigger warning (or did). 

Some educators are passionate and will do everything to fight for material and topics, but others (or their administration) will go ""Okay we won't read Catcher in the Rye - no biggie"" Even though we can agree that the story of Calisto, the Catcher in the Rye, Lovely Bones, and something like Tess of  D'Urbervilles are all very different explorations of sexual violence they would all carry the same trigger warning.","ltj7pyu"

But unlike reading, which is usually done solo, TV can be a group activity, and adults might not want to always have to watch Wonder Pets or whatever for the millionth time.

"ltow1ne","Cessily","2024-10-25 14:45:14 UTC","I don't disagree with you on content discussions. Content warnings were always a thing of sorts during my time in education and experienced professors were attuned to typical challenges when I started. I TAed for two classes that had basic ""Mature and challenging themes including death, violence, etc"" on the syllabus but it was never addressed what material had what. Sometimes a professor would address specific type of material (I discussed in other comments a particularly difficult film as a final). The library had something they used for content warnings that was generally printed when an appeal went to the review board for alternative assignment or an instructor was asking for a review. 

I want to be clear I don't disagree with the concept of content warnings. 

I was over student support services when I ended my career (high level administration) and the culture shifted.

Where I saw things shift was in the accommodations as trigger warnings gained popular discourse. We suddenly had many more each semester and it shifted to content warnings were needed, every time for every possible thing. If I have a class watching Irreversible, which depicts a violent rape, I expect some discussion for the professor to warn students. I don't expect my lit 101 instructor to provide trigger warnings for Hemingway or Shakespeare. Do you know mythology is rife with problematic behavior and if we discuss the significance of ancient pottery reliefs and the myth involves a well known story of sexual violence is that worthy or not of a trigger warning?

A short story about a baby's perspective as it's thrown down a trash shoot is a challenging setting and environment but the story includes no elements of violence itself (the narrator is innocent with no concepts it's sort of the point).

Pieces and assignments were being challenged constantly. If you are offering sixty some sessions of a class a semester, those two students each semester requesting accommodations add up, and now you need to assist a gaggle of adjunct professors through alternate assignments or assign them. Sanitizing curriculums because of administrative burden is not entirely on trigger warnings, but it was something that played out. 

And that's just one accommodation, professors are handling all the other ones too (extra time for tests or assignments, accessibility of texts, other classroom accommodations for learning disabilities or physical disabilities, etc) so does it get the warning? If you give it a warning does that mean the student has to read it a certain way (I didn't think there is a lot of ambiguity in that story but you get the point) or can we no longer argue the interpretation? 

Tess is a good example... Was it or wasn't it rape? If you give it the warning but the student doesn't read it as rape and can you still discuss it in class if two students got alternative assignments because an interpretation of sexual violence is possible? The answer is No if they have the accommodation and then you need to plan another alternative assignment for them if you give participation points for in class discussion and they need to be provided an alternate class section that isn't a burden to attend. 

Trigger warnings are always very blunt tools. Just like the warnings before TV shows. How violence is depicted can drastically vary but how many shows have that warning? We can all agree watching your weekly court room drama is a lot different than the violence depicted in The Boyz, but they both get the warning. 

If a student wants excused for every piece that involves violence, it can be problematic. Trigger warnings is where the responsibility shifted from ""I need to be prepared in how I approach the world and engage in it"" and researching the content if you are concerned to ""you have to warn me and protect me from this experience"" 

You are right, shifting a singular assignment for a student is not a big deal, but the administrative burden has become larger and the requests have greatly increased. 

I am saying this as a survivor of domestic and sexual abuse. I understand how it feels to be in a classroom and have a reaction to a text, I don't think I should have avoided every text with a trigger warning because texts that had nothing to do with my experience also made me feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed in different ways. So did films, videos, performances, and even my job where I worked over Title IX and all the sexual misconduct cases. I started sobbing unexpectedly at a slam poetry event hosted by an org I advised and had to excuse myself. I know people have it worse than me, but I also know it's our own individual journey and we have to control it. 

I don't think trigger warnings moved a delicate situation in a better direction. It added another layer to struggling ship. 

I could be wrong, it has happened before and it will happen again, but it's complex and from my perspective is a tool but not right for every situation.","lto9g0n"
"ltk3gpj","Cessily","2024-10-24 18:51:03 UTC","I wrote this in another comment, but the university should never decide whose trauma is legitimate or not, it only adapts the accommodation (also a lot of these accommodations started running through the official system because it was bigger and wider than one assignment) to the classroom environment.  Also during my tenure we did a lot to lower the threshold to accommodations to reduce the burden to high risk students.

But when faculty went from one assignment that might need an alternate for a single student every few years to multiple students every semester - you can see where the decision was made to sanitize. There was *always* been triggering material - trigger warnings is part of shifting responsibility for who is responsible for the trigger.  Trigger warnings now make it someone else's responsibility to protect you and makes it seem *normal* to need them when the need alone says we still have healing we need to do.

Ultimately we do have to figure out how to handle triggering material and cope, and if we aren't ready maybe university isn't the place for us *yet*. The world doesn't offer us the same warnings and exposure through literature and fiction grows our horizons in a safe way.  Reading Anne Frank teaches us empathy that a history class isn't going to have.  Learning how Anne Frank was edited brings another level of critical discourse to the table (lines between fiction and non and story telling, etc), and then reviewing a fictional short story like *Apt Pupil* gives us a safe way to interact with the horror in a more modern context that is applicable across a larger sense.

Tess gives us reflections and conversations about consent, rape, and social  power.  Catcher and Lolita both explore unreliable narrators and  the impacts of sexual violence but in very different ways and methods.

Students are going to confront those feelings for good or ill when they read the material, I just meant the actual unpacking isn't meant to happen in the classroom.  Again I only want lit professors to speak to literature and the many ways critical review brings depth to our minds and lives.  I agree with you about books like Lolita and it drives me nuts so many educators are shying away now because of those trends but we've been banning books for decades and now we found a way to edit and censor our experiences even further.

Personally I am a better person for the challenging material I had to confront in the classroom - I never would've done that work or had that exposure if I hadn't been assigned.  I grew into a person who sought to challenge myself in that way on my own, but my educators had to lay that groundwork.

Let's imagine you are a teacher and you make the kids climb a fire tower every spring to teach a biology concept.  Yeah you could read an article or watch a video but the fire tower is such an effective method.  Some kids sprint up the high vertical stairs, some need help and it is a lot of work, but you get the whole class up there and most kids love it, but some hate it because the heights are scary, but everyone learned the lesson and it is an experience.

Now one day you get a kid that uses a wheelchair and you can't do the fire tower this spring.  That is okay! You use pictures, videos and still teach the lesson.  Sure you could take the class and leave the one kiddo behind but you still need to teach the lesson to the kiddo who couldn't come so you just adapt that year - no big deal.  Everyone still learns - maybe you find a wheel chair friendly overlook that gives a similar view but not quite the same.  Maybe, it took extra time to find that place and make the arrangements, so maybe you didn't have the time or the replacement available even.

Every few years, replacing one lesson is some fashion is no big deal.  Maybe one year it storms anyhow so no one can go.

However, now your classroom has 3 kids in a wheelchair.  Every year.  How long are you keeping the fire tower lesson? And maybe 2 of those kids can walk independently and only use the wheelchair as needed, so *maybe* they could do the fire tower but you wouldn't really know until you were there and by that point you would be stuck on the stairs with no wheel chair in sight. Again, do you teach the lesson? Probably not, and the other kids don't get to go but they still learned the lesson through pictures or you tube videos so technically its fine, but you know its not just about the lesson plan - that climbing those steps and seeing it with your own eyes and having that experience taught more than some bullet points on the standardized test.

I ask because I've found that in lots of social situations, if something feels *weird*, that's because it's not something that happens commonly.  If I'm hoping to contribute to the world being a more interesting, engaging, and welcoming place - then saying something weird is likely to be a good thing.  There are potential risks (I risk being someone people want to avoid, I risk accidentally saying something I didn't intend), but I feel that it's a calculus worth considering.

On the other hand, if it's *awkward*, it falls under a different heuristic.  In a lot of cases, I find that social situations that feel awkward mask underlying inequalities.  In those cases, I feel an ethical imperative to push against the norm.  The easiest concrete example of this would be actually responding, verbally and with eye contact, to a panhandler.  Panhandlers make people feel awkward because they make concrete the abstract notion of wealth inequality; as such, treating them with the kindness I'd treat a coworker involves looking straight in the face of uncomfortable truths about my lived experience (that I am significantly privileged).  Doing that repeatedly helps me practice how to elevate situations from ""awkward"" to ""a good learning moment"".  I'm not always up for that - but if I am up to it, I consider it a good thing to do.

Even five years ago, young people just out of high school who were starting college were better prepared, and had spent at least some of their earlier years expected to learn how to handle their emotions.  But not only at the current crop kids of the lockdowns, they’ve all ONLY been taught under the current methods that are known to fail, and have been coddled since infancy. It has nothing to do with the college or program, and everything to do with how schools are required to teach kids, and how teachers are forced to pass kids even if kids don’t turn in their work, and how parents have started to do everything possible to make sure their kids don’t experience discomforts.  Those of us who let our kids experience discomfort and tell them “too bad” on occasion can be seen as bad parents, if not abusive, simply for refusing to remove every obstacle in our kids’ lives.

Go to r/teachers  or any of the subreddits for college profs and ask about it how kids in schools are handling adversity, and you’ll laughed out of the forum because their younger students can’t, whereas five years ago, they could.","ltrfua8"

That’s why I appreciate content notes/trigger warnings. Because maybe I feel strong enough today to read something like that and be totally fine. But maybe I don’t, and I picked up that book for escapism and to stop ruminating on the event. On days like that, any reminder of what happened is…hard.

I agree that it's not a solution for every instance and I actually think it's not a *solution*, full stop.

Even in your story, you  had a choice to engage or not, and unexpected things can cause reactions as well, so it's not like people are actually able to completely avoid a topic. Plus, we all know many teachers will never adopt this kind of thing. So it's really not the massive movement it's being framed as, and it's disingenuous to have this kind of moral panic about it when it's genuinely a small proportion of teachers just trying to be more sensitive.

The reason I asked is because you said she's not representative of most men, and also argued that Gender Essentialism is correct. 


However based on your response it's clear that you're not actually a Gender Essentialist. You share several of their beliefs, but you don't agree with their primary tenet.


Allow me to explain. Gender Essentialism asserts that the origin of gender is a certain innate essence (hence the name) which resides eternally, unchangeably and universally in everyone, which makes all humans either male and causes them to develop and possess distinctly male features and abilities, or else female and possess certain distinctly female features and abilities. Without exception.  


Traditionally Gender Essentialism philosophy usually considered this essence spiritual in nature, but nowadays modern Gender Essentialists generally considers gender to be rooted instead in biology, specifically the sex chromosomes. 


Unlike you, a Gender Essentialist would usually insist that a woman with XY chromosomes is a man. They would say it doesn't matter if they they looked like woman or claimed to feel like a woman, in their view that is a man who is delusional or faking being a woman and their chromosomes are telling on them.  


One of their key counter-arguments would be that gender relates to reproductive ability and a person with XY chromosomes cannot give birth. Hence why I raised that point.


However like yourself when faced with examples where such claims are ridiculous and patently false,  Gender Essentialism would similarly maintain there is nonetheless still 2 only genders in humans and that ALL humans are either 1 gender or the other. Period. They would similarly dismisss the existence of intersex individuals, or others with characteristics which don't conform to the 2 gender model, as irrelevant mistakes of biology, which don't need to be accounted for when considering human genders because they're not proper humans and can safely be ignored. ","lu595am"

Then the episode was over, and I asked where that scene was.  As someone who grew up with an alcoholic abusive mother, the Christmas in that episode would have been my idea of a great Christmas.  But to people who didn’t grow up experiencing alcohol-involved violence and abuse and melt-downs, it was more than they could handle.  I wouldn’t have put a warning on that episode. A warning, if anything, would be for the people who had such great lives that that would be their idea of a rough day.

Now, you said what was hard was that there were characters with similar names to you and some of your relatives, not that you experienced violence.  I’m going to guess here that you haven’t had an abusive partner.  Being the one in a position of being abused isn’t something you’ve ever had to give much thought to, and this was a first time for you.
