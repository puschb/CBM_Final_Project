There is a massive change in the middle portion of the book that takes up a large chunk, however. And I had major issues with it. There are several characters that are suddenly introduced, and it becomes overwhelming and I did not care for them at all. The impact of this portion fell flat for me.

I know it gets lots of hate, but I think people tend to overlook that this book purposefully doesn’t take itself seriously and is a reflection of actual fairy tales, so quick moving storyline with unanswered magic is part of the magic itself.

"lse61f4","tarekd19","2024-10-17 17:20:45 UTC","i finished the audio book over the summer. It's definitely not one of King's finest. It drags a bit for awhile before it even gets to the fantasy, which plays out like King's take on Alice and Wonderland. It's fun enough on its own but don't keep expectations high. It probably gets best in the latter quarter of the book. Some weird character and plot decisions too that i felt weren't really fleshed out but it might be because i listened to it rather than read it. Also King doesn't seem to understand HIPPA and his writing for the teenage boy in the 2010's feels very inauthentic at times, where he needs to make his hobby watching classic movies on AMC so King has a way to stay in his comfort zone while talking through the character. 

Overall it was fine, the first King book i'd read in years. I don't think i'd revisit it. I actually think it might do better as a mini series/ movie than the book that it was, except it might take too long for Alice to get to Wonderland. The audiobook even has King himself do a brief voice for his self-insert.","lsdcvid"

Nope, the book was just setup like that for…some reason. The writing itself was good, but the two halves felt so disconnected from each other it broke my immersion.","lsdcvid"

We know how fuckable they are as soon as they appear, even if they’re only in the book for a short paragraph. “Tall and toned.” “Generous breasts.” Has a backside that moves “bewitchingly” as she walks away.

I'm generally not a 'deep' reader, so his writing is fine for me.  It's much more ""story telling"" rather than ""literature"".  And he's damn good at telling a story.  I was surprised how much emotion I felt in some parts of 'Fairy Tale' and 'Joyland', similar to how I felt when I got into his writing 30 years ago.

"lsegfc2","IAmThePonch","2024-10-17 18:14:47 UTC","It was a combination of many things

First, and foremost, I just don’t think I “get” holly. He loves her to pieces, and apparently so do a lot of other people considering Holly was the sixth book she’s appeared in. But I remember reading mr Mercedes’ and thinking “she was fine for this story, didn’t find much special about her.” I don’t find her endearing or intriguing, just kind of bland when she isn’t being unbearably twee (like the way she “swears” makes me cringe- it’s so poopy).

Second, yeah the near nonstop references to recent events grew to be exhausting. I get it, he’s telling a story theoretically based in our world, but some pages had multiple references to Covid and trump and everything else. It felt a little weird how he used characters and events to sneak in his commentary on these things. And I say this as someone that despises trump as much as the next rational person, too, mind you, it’s not a “brbrbr muh freedom” situation. An occasional reference here and there would have been fine but by like page 20 I grew tired of the nonstop references and when I looked up the plot summary I really don’t understand what it added to the story.

Lastly, king has this infuriating habit when he writes these crime/ mystery stories where characters are investigating things the reader already knows about. For instance in mr Mercedes bill is investigating the killer and trying to figure out who he is, but we already know who he is by page like 30 or something. I had the same issue with the dark half- amazing first chunk that gets bogged down by sheriff pangborn investigating George stark and trying to figure out if he’s real. I already know he’s real, I’ve read about three murders he’s already committed! And I had the exact same issue in Holly. She’s going through this pain staking investigative process learning details we already know from the flip flopping scenes with the elderly killers. It felt super redundant and got old well before the halfway point. King, it seems, just can’t do crime procedurals (aside from maybe Later which I did enjoy).

Sorry for the essay but you asked lol","lse84t9"

I get it confused with Talisman (Jack's travels), and The Dark tower with the city they get stuck in with the drums and such.","lse9xmo"

The sense of wanting to know what the big deal was, yeah. All that foreshadowing and build up was incredible writing. Easily the best part of the book.","lse9xmo"

"lsey8pk","superfastswm","2024-10-17 19:49:19 UTC","Well, look, I didn't know it was gonna be bad for most of the book. This was my first King novel, and for the first half-ish with the old man, the boy, and the dog, it was pretty interesting. Good mystery, good character development, good dog, I was intrigued! Then we enter the fairy land, and while yes, there were some inturesting ideas explored with its worldbuilding and lore, there wasn't anything that I felt made it superb, but that was okay, because we had all that cool mystery and foreshadowing in act one, so that'll all get sorted and be worth it in the end right?

No. No, not really. He wins the day through the power of having read a book sometime before the book starts. There was good potential, but then it sort of flopped at the end. Very dissappinting.

Also, it was the only book I had on a trip to Nevada, so I was a little desprate.","lsew7ia"

It's totally fine to read a whole book and decide at the end it was a dud. That's my ultimate opinion of the book. It will make a better TV show.","lsey8pk"
