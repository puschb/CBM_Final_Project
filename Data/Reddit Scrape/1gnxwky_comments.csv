“In the chats I have had with this wonder man, I have always found his English fluent, but a bit on the mixed side. If you remember, he was with Mrs. Bingo Little for a time before coming to Brinkley, and no doubt he picked up a good deal from Bingo. Before that, he had been a couple of years with an American family at Nice and had studied under their chauffeur, one of the Maloneys of Brooklyn. So, what with Bingo and what with Maloney, he is, as I say, fluent but a bit mixed.

He spoke, in part, as follows:

“Hot dog! You ask me what is it? Listen. Make some attention a little. Me, I have hit the hay, but I do not sleep so good, and presently I wake and up I look, and there is one who make faces against me through the dashed window. Is that a pretty affair? Is that convenient? If you think I like it, you jolly well mistake yourself. I am so mad as a wet hen. And why not? I am somebody, isn’t it? This is a bedroom, what-what, not a house for some apes? Then for what do blighters sit on my window so cool as a few cucumbers, making some faces?”

“Quite,” I said. Dashed reasonable, was my verdict…


“Wait yet a little. I am not finish. I say I see this type on my window, making a few faces. But what then? Does he buzz off when I shout a cry, and leave me peaceable? Not on your life. He remain planted there, not giving any damns, and sit regarding me like a cat watching a duck. He make faces against me and again he make faces against me, and the more I command that he should get to hell out of here, the more he do not get to hell out of here. He cry something towards me, and I demand what is his desire, but he do not explain. Oh, no, that arrives never. He does but shrug his head. What damn silliness! Is this amusing for me? You think I like it? I am not content with such folly. I think the poor mutt’s loony. Je me fiche de ce type infect. C’est idiot de faire comme ça l’oiseau.... Allez-vous-en, louffier....

>After years of patient study (and with cricket there can be no other kind) I have decided that there is nothing wrong with the game that the introduction of golf carts wouldn't fix in a hurry. It is not true that the English invented cricket as a way of making all other human endeavors look interesting and lively; that was merely an unintended side effect. I don't wish to denigrate a sport that is enjoyed by millions, some of them awake and facing the right way, but it is an odd game. It is the only sport that incorporates meal breaks. It is the only sport that shares its name with an insect. It is the only sport in which spectators burn as many calories as players — more if they are moderately restless. It is the only competitive activity of any type, other than perhaps baking, in which you can dress in white from head to toe and be as clean at the end of the day as you were at the beginning.

>Imagine a form of baseball in which the pitcher, after each delivery, collects the ball from the catcher and walks slowly with it to center field; and that there, after a minute's pause to collect himself, he turns and runs full tilt toward the pitcher's mound before hurling the ball at the ankles of a man who stands before him wearing a riding hat, heavy gloves of the sort used to handle radio-active isotopes, and a mattress strapped to each leg. Imagine moreover that if this batsman fails to hit the ball in a way that heartens him sufficiently to try to waddle forty feet with mattress's strapped to his legs, he is under no formal compunction to run; he may stand there all day, and, as a rule, does. If by some miracle he is coaxed into making a miss-stroke that leads to his being put out, all the fielders throw up their arms in triumph and have a hug. Then tea is called and every one retires happily to a distant pavilion to fortify for the next siege. Now imagine all this going on for so long that by the time the match concludes autumn has crept in and all your library books are overdue. There you have cricket.",""

I had read the book twice before that in highschool and middle school too but reading it in college was the first time it really resonated with me. It has such powerful messages about feminism and Jane is so representative of all the amazing women I've had the privilege to know in my life. She's so independent and forward thinking and she always stands true to what she believes and always believes in herself even when nobody else will. She's such an icon and personal hero for me. 

That line is also just incredibly relatable because she's just casually describing how she annoyed Rochester and he was mad and crusty. Its just ridiculous and so funny to me to use that word choice. Its like she's describing a stale piece of bread 😂",""

3. My german teacher gave me a YA western comedy called ""Der traurige Sheriff"" (The sad Sheriff). It's hilarious from start to finish and I still reread it once every year or two, more than twenty years later. Sadly I don't think it ever got translated from german into other languages. Quotes I randomly use in everyday life: The ""horse hanging trick"" which according to the indians in the book is a ""great trick but only if indians come from one side. If indians come from other side, whole trick is kaputt"" or after firing blindly one shot out of a window: ""some joker said I hit five of them but that can't be true, I didn't even aim"".",""

>Ford Prefect: “You'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace.  It's rather unpleasantly like being drunk.”

>Arthur Dent: “What's so unpleasant about being drunk?”

>Ford Prefect: “Ask a glass of water.”



However, sometimes I come across humorous passages where I'm not expecting them, case in point, BG Bernard Fergusson's WWII memoir, *The Wild Green Earth*, wherein Fergusson fondly recounts several humorous anecdotes about his experiences with Army pack mules:

>“With dawn the tempo of the crossing \\[the Chindwin River\\] increased, particularly so far as the animals \\[mules\\] were concerned. They do not greatly care for river-crossing at the best of times; in the dark they look on it as President Coolidge’s preacher looked on sin: they are against it. With daylight they can see what they are in for and some of them are prepared to have a shot at it” (p. 65).  


>“Wherever there is a steep hill, the mule likes to subscribe to the old Scot’s saying: ‘A stout hert to a stey brae’ \\[‘steep slope’\\]; he likes to take it at the double. Woe betide the muleteer who gets in the way; unless he can keep a firm hold on his beast he is flung down and trampled… So here they came, these gallant mules: trotting or galloping up the hill, with nostrils dilated and an uncommonly wild look in their eye; completely masterless, and deeply resentful of being halted for a compulsory breather. Many a man whose duty it was to stop them went flying when he tried it, howling horrible blasphemies as he hurtled into the wet jungle. A few loads slipped; more often a portion of the track collapsed, and the mule rolled over and over down the hillside until he lay, breathing great gallops of air, helpless until his load was taken off him. Even this wasn't an easy job: first the surcingle  had to come off, then the load, then the girth; and before you were ready for him, there would be a heave and a plunge, and the beast was on his feet—and, like as not, on yours” (pp. 44-5).",""

He lay sprawled, too wicked to move, spewed up like a broken spider-crab on the tarry shingle of morning. The light did him harm, but not as much as looking at things did; he resolved, having done it once, never to move his eyeballs again. A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse. His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he’d somehow been on a cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police. He felt bad.

She’s funny and educational. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory and From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death are her 2 adult books. Both about her experiences as a mortician and questions people have about death and yet funny, interesting and heartwarming.","lwjrj3m"

Once it caught on as a cult classic, Tommy Wisseau really tried to lean into the quality and content of the movie as if he had done it on purpose. It was always apparent he had intended on it being taken seriously.

What’s even crazier about the situation is that the book *The Disaster Artist* often focuses on how Tommy has a seemingly endless wellspring of cash that he used to fund the movie entirely by himself. Now it looks like he’s funneling all that toward court fees. 

The saga continues.","lwjlohk"

"lxo695u","WhichTonight","2024-11-17 23:28:41 UTC","I didn’t realize that about him and must say that disappoints me.  I really struggle to separate the person from their art (and in his case, other than his fiction, I’ve spent hours reading where he’s writing and connecting to moments of his life that I would have found it especially difficult had I known). With social media and even their own writings or posts we know so much more about actors, directors, writers, artists, etc than we knew about those that were protected by agents in the old days. This can bring about protections for the innocent but also lack of privacy for innocent parties and of course the dilemma we have as fans. I’m open and forgiving to friends and might say, their life, their choices but with a writer, I somehow feel like the relationship between author and reader is so intimate and they’ve broken this sacred covenant and I can’t read them anymore or certainly in the same light. I have yet to read the book Monsters:A Fan’s Dilemma by Claire Dederer but it talks about this same thing. Dederer argues that audiences can’t divorce their reactions to an artist’s work from what they know about the artist’s life.","lwyg50g"
