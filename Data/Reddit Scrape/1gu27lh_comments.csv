**Grim Tales, by Edith Nesbit**, a collection of ghost stories.  Nesbit's work tends toward the melodramatic, and her endings come across as telegraphed to modern readers who are familiar with the genre, but I think the craft of her writing has aged well.  Similar to Mary Wilkins Freeman, some of her stories seem corny now, but others are still very effective emotionally (I think ""From the Dead"" was the best in the collection, including in this respect).

Working on:

**Packing for Mars, by Mary Roach**, a pop-science book about space travel.  It's good—by this point, I've read almost everything she's written, so I know to expect that—but the discussion ""flows"" from topic to topic noticeably better than in a couple of her other books.  The tone of the writing displays her usual combination of dry humor and enthusiastic curiosity:

> It seems odd to be talking about the dangers of fire-retarding suds and open-toed shoes rather than the dangers of riding a jet that repeatedly pulls out of a kamikaze dive into a climb so steep that the engines shudder.  This mix of extremes—workaday paranoia and aeronautic abandon—seems to typify the world of government-funded space travel.  NASA's buildings are plastered with warning signs for the most Tinkerbell dangers.  […]  Wet-umbrella bag dispensers are installed at building entrances, courtesy of the Safety Action Team, to keep the floors dry.  It's as though NASA were populated by legions of hopeless pratfalling Mr. Bean types.

Later:

> The [Holloman Air Force Base] staff played hot potato with my call until someone could locate the Person in Charge of Lying to the Press.  The PCLP said that the room that houses the base archives is locked.  And that only the curator would have a key.  And that Holloman currently has no curator.  Evidently the new curator's first task would be to *find a way to open the archives.*  Now I was sure of it:  the chimp-to-the-moon files were locked up in there along with the [Enos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enos_(chimpanzee\\)) in-flight sex tapes and pictures of Colonel Stapp in a tutu.",""

I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this one. Neil Strauss also wrote *The Game* after a deep dive into the world of pickup artists, and while I haven't read that one, I've generally been the kind of person who dislikes seeing dating and relationships as a ""game"" to be ""won."" But *The Truth* pleasantly surprised me, a solid recounting of the author's journey to connect ""dating"" with ""building a stable, loving relationship."" I don't want to spoil too much, but it's noteworthy that one of the big takeaways is that a lot of self-awareness and work on himself led to better outcomes with others.

"lxr5ncx","caught_red_wheeled","2024-11-18 13:41:05 UTC","So there was something special I wanted to read this week, partially because of something else that happened and partially because I wanted to take a short break from classical literature.

My dad lost his battle with melanoma over the weekend, so I chose to reread **Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach** in his honor. My dad had some pretty severe dyslexia, so he didn’t read very much at all. It wasn’t enough where it really affected him a lot in his life, and he became a highly successful engineer instead, but English was always a struggle for him. He read mostly magazines and things that had pictures (he didn’t really know about graphic novels, but I’m sure he knew he would’ve read those too). 

One day, in seventh grade, my instructor assigned Jonathan Livingston Seagull class. I love that book and so I came home raving about how good it was. For whatever reason, my dad suddenly wanted to read it too. So when I was done I asked if I could keep my copy for a little longer and lent it to him. He devoured it and I remember it was probably the first and only time a book brought a smile to his face (he was neutral or annoyed when he had to read otherwise). 

We got into as much of a literature discussion as we could, but I remember he loved that book and couldn’t stop talking about how Jonathan tried to go back to his flock. I can’t remember why he liked that scene so much but it really stuck out that it was his favorite. It’s a shame that the fourth part was still unreleased because that gives the conclusion of that and shows that Jonathan was at least somewhat successful, even if it wasn’t in the way he envisioned.  I’m not sure what my dad would’ve thought of that part, but I think he would’ve liked it. 

Unfortunately, my dad couldn’t quite understand my decision to pursue English and Spanish education (to become a literature instructor, although I mostly do it with English now), and originally was concerned I wouldn’t make enough money. But I’m glad that we were able to share a moment with a book together. I was able to give him a piece of that world and show him a little bit about why I love literature and teaching it so much. I think he came around understanding my decision near the end, because he was really proud that I got into my Master of Arts in English: Literature Concentration program a month before he passed. Either way, I’m glad I got to share a little bit more of the world of literature with him before the end. It probably wasn’t because of that book since it was so long ago and I doubt he remembered that, but it was a nice way to remember it for myself.

Sentimental thoughts aside, the book is still one of my most favorite books of all time and probably always will be. However, as an adult I like it for different reasons. I have a noticeable physical disability (cerebral palsy), walking with a walker and a limp. However, I was (and still am) classified academically as gifted, even for the private college prep school I eventually ended up in. I also had some medical issues that were untreated and undiagnosed because no one knew they existed yet. So I ended up missing a lot of school but not really being able to explain why. With all of that, there wasn’t anyone really like me there and I was targeted by bullies over it (nothing aside from verbal insults for the most part, thankfully), so I ended up identifying a lot with Jonathan and felt like an outcast.

Looking back as an adult, I identify more with the second part and the unreleased fourth part. The second part is where he goes to heaven and finds people who think the way he does. I spent a lot of time job and career hopping, especially since my physical disability excluded and still excludes me from most menial jobs (like most aspects of retail, a lot of aspects of administrative assistant work, and all food service/waitressing). A lot of my search was because of only finding and holding temporary in-person jobs, getting caught up in the COVID-19 lockdowns, trying to take classes to apply for remote work in related fields that then popped up because of the pandemic (like different types of writing), and then not having the experience required even when I could apply. However, just as much of it was trying to find where I belonged professionally, so to speak. I finally found that belonging teaching adults at my current job, which is why I’m going back from my masters in August so I can do more of that. If that and everything related goes well, I’m also planning get a PhD at some point so I can teach four year colleges. So I still have a ways to go in that journey. But I really feel more of a sense of belonging and a lot more stable now than I did when I was younger. So at this point not only am I finding others like me, but I will (hopefully) continue to. And that’s what happens with Jonathan in the second part.

In the fourth part, it talks about the Jonathan’s teachings have spread to the flock but not entirely.  They know that what he did was important and that it must be remembered and preserved, but not how to do it for themselves. I really saw it as sweet because he eventually did get his goal in a sense where he was able to show them the importance, even if it wasn’t enough for them to pass all the information on. 

As a teacher, I feel like a lot of my students reach that point. A lot of them don’t always completely understand or don’t remember long-term what I teach them, but they don’t forget that I have taught them and that they usually understand and feel a lot better about the material after I teach them. It helps them understand why they should know so that they can continue to use the skills, even if they still have trouble sometimes or don’t retain it long-term. A lot of them thank me profusely afterward, even if I’m not with them for a long time and there’s no guarantee they will remember after. 

And I think that’s the beauty of it. The flock goes from shunning him to memorializing him and his students, making sure that they will never be forgotten in a positive way. They may not completely change their ways and there might never be someone like Jonathan again, but the other seagulls will never forget the one that tried to fly higher and became the closest thing to an angel or even God. It’s very sweet after a bit of a bleak ending in the third part when it shows the flock would never change and the outcasts are pretty much alone. But regardless of the ending, it’s still a book that had a profound effect on me and one that I will never forget.",""

**Stoner, John Williams**

>went in blind, kept waiting for something to happen, like the character's life sucked, and he didn't make great choices and THAT WAS IT. No redemption, no meeting up with a lost love (which was controversial regardless), no happy point, it was just all depressing lmao, but well written. Was 3 stars until the last couple chapters but I gave it 3.75/5 for the beautifully written ending

**1984, George Orwell**
**Animal Farm, George Orwell**

>read Animal Farm as a teenager and it went so over my head, remember thinking ""the pigs are bourgeoisie or something"" with no idea what that meant. On re reading it's painfully obvious who is who and I don't know where I got lost lmao. A lot of the same themes are covered in both books, fear, paranoia, propaganda and an oppressive ruling class. Both are great, 1984 had some slow points but I had an idea of the story already so maybe its well paced for someone going in blind. Either way both 4.5/5.

**Mother Night, Kurt Vonnegut**

> Very short, about the fictitious life of an American playwright, living in Germany before the 2nd World War, who goes on to become a double agent, posing as a Nazi propagandist and radio host. I really enjoyed this book, Vonnegut is great at making horrible people seem real and this little story is conflicting, every character is deeply flawed (some through no fault of their own really) but somehow I still found them funny and wanted to find out what happened to each of them. 4.5/5",""

**Blood Justice by Terry J. Benton-Walker**-This series continues to be a lot of fun, the things it's setting up for the third book seem interesting. 

**Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters**-This made me cry, a lot, it's a really good exploration of queerness in victorian society. Also some of the spicier scenes get *very* spicy, but I'm not complaining...

**The Gilded Ones by Namina Forna**-I put this one off for so long because I expected to be disappointed, but I ended up liking it a lot. It's pretty standard YA fare for the most part, but I love how the setting incorporates the author's own experiences with a very misogynistic society. 

**The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by VE Schwab**-I could be really snarky about this book but I probably shouldn't, so I'll just say that the prose and the magic realism vibes were nice but it wasn't really my thing. 

Currently Reading: 

**The Bone Ships by RJ Barker**-I've had my eye on this book for a while, the closest library to me didn't have it  but I went to another nearby town recently and took the opportunity to check out their library. I love this author's brand of quirky fantasy, it's so fun and fresh. 

Other books from the library: 

**Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan**-Another book that I've been thinking of reading for a long time. The cover is pretty and I like chinese mythology retellings, there's not much more to it...  

**The Merciless Ones by Namina Forna**-It really says a lot about how much I liked the gilded ones that I'm already planning to read the sequel, I can't wait to see where the setting goes. 

**Black Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James**-My local library has a copy of the sequel to this, so it's been on my radar for a while. I'm always down to read some african-inspired fantasy, it's interesting and a bit different. 

**Timberdark by Darren Charlton**-This is a sequel to a book that's probably up there with my favourite books of all time, so I can't wait to see where the really unusual setting goes in this book. Do I think Wranglestone needed a sequel? No. Am I complaining? Also no.",""

**The Five Year Lie, by Sarina Bowen**
New book! I was interested in seeing a romance author forray into thriller and decided to give it a go. It wasnt super thriller-y. Definetly more of a soft mystery and honestly? Didnt hate the romance which is new for me. I gave it 4/5.


**Weyward, by Emilia Hart**
I enjoyed this one a ton! It was obviously super heavy and tragic but the experiences these women went through are unfortunately common. It was really nice to see sisterhood and matriarchal influence be what really helps the women of the story get through what they endure, and to hand lessons down throughout generations. I gave it 4.5/5


Started:


**Swan Song - Elin Hilderbrand**
This will be the last book by this author I try to read. I dont care for the writing style and have noticed shes fond of the same tropes book after book. I am mostly finished and do wanna see how the mystery of the story in particular plays out, so I am going to keep reading it.But her book seemed to consistently be low performers for me.


**Pumpkin Everything by Beth Labonte**
A local book club pick, this isnt my usual cup of tea but i am enjoying the fall descriptions and am interested to see (hopefully) the emotional intelligence of the FMC and MMC improve by the end of it. Im just glad its a short book.


**Night for Day by Roselle Lim**
Batting 0 this week on the exciting reads. This is another interesting premise of a book and I do like the characters so far, but I have learned that Roselle Lim is a YA author and that has justified the quality of the writing for me. I feel like Im breezing through this. 


Im definetly picking something heavier and more prose heavy next week. ",""

Now that I've actually read the book, I can absolutely say the miniseries is one of the best adaptations I've ever seen.

My favourites were the 2 by **A.M. Burrage, Playmates and The Sweeper**, **Afterward by Edith Warton**, and **The Upper Berth by F Marion Crawford**. 

I'm now continuing my read of **The Monk, by Matthew Lewis**, an early Gothic novel from the 1790s and the first I'd say that employed more overt (for it's time) sex scenes. Lewis also wrote it when he was 19 and I feel like has that teen angst to it which is also always fun to read historically.

The author's mother died of breast cancer when the author was 12. The mother struggled with cancer for 9 years and when she knew she was going to die from it she created a 2 boxes of keepsakes, one each for her daughter and son. In each box each keepsake is separately boxed and is to be opened at certain milestones in life, the most common ones being birthdays, but there are others. Many of the keepsakes are jewelry but there are notes and letters.

Using the timeline of the keepsakes as a timeline for the memoir the author looks back on her childhood with her parents, then on life without her mother, and finally on life without her father. She offers glimpses into her wider family and her own inner life. Upon reaching adulthood she looks back at her parents' marriage and lives with greater understanding of both them and herself.

I found this interesting having lost both of my parents over 20 years ago, and having no other family to whom I could turn to for family memories. I only have the things they left me.",""

Slowly continued. It's recommended reading for my current meditation practice and I'm curious about buddhism, taoism etc. anyway. I was told not to take any of the texts literally, but it's proving difficult, because so many illustrative arguments are factually wrong, even with basic knowledge of modern natural sciences. For example, no, it's not a law of nature that there are four seasons, as can be observed in many places with progressing climate breakdown. And telling me to simply don't think about much of the text isn't satisfying.

Continuing with As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner

The Crimson Campaign, by Brian McClellan

Started - 

Templars: The Knights who made Britain, by Steve Tibble.

The two McClellan books are part of the Powder Mage Trilogy. A flintlock fantasy series. I'm enjoying it. I like to dip into fantasy every month or so. I prefer high fantasy, magic, etc. but this premises caught my eye. 

This series is set in a world roughly analogous with Europe at the very start of the industrial revolution. Very interesting premise. Set in a world of traditional, divine right of Kings. The first novel begins with the capture of a King and a move towards the foundation of a Republic. There are magic users, 'Privileged', who are small in number but are trained and sworn to protect the King. They're the most powerful magic users. There's then 'Powder mages' a relatively new development in the world who came about from the introduction of gun powder. They can manipulate bullets and snort gun powder to heighten their senses and enhance their speed, strength, etc. and finally there are people with 'knacks' - they aren't magic users but have unique abilities, normally only one. 

Examples are a character that has an absolutely flawless memory, another that doesn't need sleep, etc. 

I know some people aren't great fans of the way women are written throughout the story, which I can kind of see. But the premises itself is interesting and I'm enjoying it.

The Templar book is great. It gives an overview of the development of the Knights Templar and how they functioned. With a particular focus on the order in Britain and British members. It covers pretty much the entirety of the Templar movement, from it's inception, to it's decline. Great read.",""

President Jack Ryan, four decades ago, was an intelligence analyst instrumental in facilitating the secret defection of a Soviet submarine commander and his boat. Now his daughter Katie, a young Naval intelligence analyst, is investigating a new nuclear torpedo loaded on the latest Russian submarine.  A group of Russian oligarchs longing for the glory of the old Soviet Union plot to use this new weapon in a first strike on the United States to kickstart Russia's return to status of a world power. Katie becomes involved in the hunt to find the submarine and prevent disaster in a mission that highlights her inherited intelligence, acumen, and impulsiveness.  This reads like a sequel to the wildly successful **Hunt for Red October**. I really enjoyed this one.

**Little Fish, by Casey Plett** \\- a reread. I read this first in 2019, and I remember liking it a lot. I liked it even more the second time around. It's a really nuanced depiction of life as a trans woman in Canada, and it's sort of overwhelmingly a little depressing, but in a way that doesn't bog the narrative down at all. I really recommend it as an insightful character piece.

**Wandering Stars, by Tommy Orange** \\- I wanted to like this one so much more than I did, because *There There* is one of my favourite books, but I didn't feel like the stucture of this combined prequel/sequel worked particularly well. I liked it, but it didn't hold up to its predecessor, imo.

**InuYasha Vol. 39, by Rumiko Takahashi**

This bit of arc is going slower because I time my manga reading out with my non-manga reading and Orlando has huge chapters.

**Adulthood is a Myth, by Sarah Andersen**

Quick little read. I guess I realized I like only some of her comics through this. I didn't enjoy it as much as other web comic collections I've read. That said, I'm still going to read all 4 of her other comic collections haha

**Gender Queer, by Maia Kobabe**

I really liked this book. There are parts where my opinion or view on life was different from the artist's but that's okay. It's Eir life story and that's how E experienced it. I didn't think it discredited the book at all like some reviews online suggested. I loved all the queer books E mentioned!

**Dinosaurology, by  Raleigh Rimes**

Ultimately I found this Ology a little lacking. I love dinosaurs, but the through story on this one and then the little dinosaur fact sheets made a non-cohesive reading experience. Also, there were a lot of ""notes from the publisher"" clarifying information ""written"" by the author and those also served to make this less immersive.

Currently Reading:

**Orlando, by Virginia Woolf**

The leg running bit is funny. It cracked me up how the language in the book is often over the top and then when the gender change happens it's just ""he was a woman."" I am excited to see where Orlando's life goes now after the change. I'm at the point where she's home in England and also trying to figure that out for herself.

Started:

**Dungeonology, by Matt Forbeck**

I am a little skeptical of the D&D tie in to the ology series. It's a lot more technical than the other Ologies so far and the fact that the D&D books have their own style of publishing means the publisher for this book didn't even attempt to make it seem like this volume was real and Volocamp its actual author. There aren't as my interactive elements so far, but looking ahead there is a very impressive map that folds out. Nearing the end of this series and looking foward to what I'll do for my ""fun"" category of reading after. Goosebumps or Deltora? Decisions decisions.

**Horoscopes for the Dead, by Billy Collins**

It's been a while since I read a poetry collection, but I wish I hadn't picked this up for my return to poetry. I can't for the life of me remember why this was on my ""Want to read"" list, but it was, so here we are. The poetry isn't bad, it's just not my style. I will finish this volume, but I don't think I'll read anything else by Billy Collins.",""

Bright Objects, by Ruby Todd

A small Australian town is rocked by general weirdness around the discovery of the brightest comet in recent history. MC is a young widow who is following threads related to the death of her husband and the comet, which become weirdly entertained. A bit slow if you’re expecting a thriller’s pace, but I liked it. 3.75 stars for me. 

The Body in the Garden, by Katherine Schellman 

Cute cozy historical mystery, feminist heroine, slow burn romance subplot (part of a series), basically no spice. My before bed time calm down book. 

Started

The Might Red, by Louise Erdrich 

One of my favorite authors. I’m finding myself laughing more during this one. One of the main characters is an 18 year old girl who sees her life going in directions she doesn’t want (or does she?) and her internal thought processes make you want to scream at her to flex her agency, while at the same time being so, so relatable.",""

I was browsing the used bookstore, and this title caught my eye. I picked it up for $2, and frankly it's a little scary by how contemporary it sounds. It's about this literal ""snake oil"" salesman who uses a flamboyant radio preacher; the demonization of black people, Jews, and intellectuals; and the promise of economic prosperity after the Great depression to win the presidency. With the help of a private militia, the country devolves into a fascist state.

**It Didn't Start With You, by Mark Wolynn**

I did not enjoy this book at all. The author seemed to take the idea of epigenetics and ran it in through a psychoanalytic lens without any of the scientific nuance of epigenetics whatsoever. No specific theoretical framework to work from, either, just hearsay that cherry picks from other theories without actual citation. Toxic family dynamics will flow through the generations and influence the behavior of later generations, yes; but not through some psychic genetic mechanism as the author heavily implies. I should mention I am inclined toward cognitive and behavioral theories, myself, so I am biased.

This one brought to mind another series, *SaiKano, by Shin Takahashi*, in how in it's atmospheric yet vague way it vaguely depicts a world at war. And a devastating one at that. Fighting for who knows what reason. Though in this case aliens factor into the whole thing. Which gives us the background of a story where our main character in true fashion happenstances his way into gaining control of an alien robot. Who when it's not big and fighting it takes the form of a cute girl.


So like the aforementioned series I likened this to, this series is deliberately vague and requires the reader to piece together the information that we're given as to just what's going on. And I tell ya, this one is a doozy. And the main character and all the side characters around him aren't exactly paragons of say, ""typical expected behavior"" either. It's really hard to describe, especially without spoilers. But the point is though, this one makes for a very surreal experience. And the artwork certainly helps in that regard. Though unlike the series I likened this to, this one clearly was given the heave ho without the chance to fully tell whatever story it had planned leaving a very open ending with numerous plot points just left up in the air. To the point where it basically says ""yeah sorry about, you're gonna have to use your imagination on this one"" in the afterword.


So yeah. Messy ending, but getting there was a heck of a surreal experience to say the very least.",""

Both books have great plots, with action, romance, and espionage. He is a great writer, puts a lot of thought into settings and build up, makes you appreciate the characters and especially the romances between them. 

High Command is a book about an English expatriate sneaking back into Russian-occupied UK to execute a high ranking official and rescue his lady love. At one point Emmerton spends 20+ pages on how the main character met his girlfriend at an inn on the English coast. It is so well written and beautiful. The action sequences are great, as is the high level dive into the war games of the US, UK, and Russia.

"lxr31q5","dlt-cntrl","2024-11-18 13:23:39 UTC","As always, it depends on what you like.

The things I like about his books are:

He writes women quite well, they're not wilting flowers.

He gives a lot of entertaining information about the subjects he includes.

He absolutely loves horses, and that comes through. Not all the books are about racing but do contain horses in some respects.

The stories are always interesting and different. There is always peril and action.

The only book I've struggled with is Field of Thirteen, a short story collection. I just prefer his novels, there was nothing wrong with the book at all. In fact I found the end to one story really shocking and so it was my favourite.

In my opinion the books do get better over time, but are all a good quick read. Perhaps get one and see how you feel about it?

"lxses44","logicless_bt","2024-11-18 17:49:24 UTC","So, I did like the atmosphere and air of urgency. That's something Andy Weir always does well with (in addition to the science aspects, obviously). 

That said, the characters are basically cardboard cutouts, the minor ones especially but even the major ones. Mark Watney's traits in The Martian are 1. childish humor, and 2. science. Jazz's traits in Artemis are 1. childish/sexual humor and 2. science. Weir must have listened to critics' complaints, because he removed trait #1 from Ryland Grace in Project Hail Mary. The problem is that he didn't really replace it with anything. Sure, Ryland is a teacher, but on a character level that translates to a vague sense of goodwill and belief in humanity -- and since he's on a mission saving humanity, that falls extremely flat. No character grows or develops in a meaningful way: even when Ryland learns the major twist about how he ended up on the space ship, he basically shrugs it off and continues what he's doing. 

Also, the prose and dialogue are extremely disinteresting. I almost put the book down in the first 10% because the dialogue was almost offensive as a reader. Characters simply exposited to one another back and forth.  

That said, I did finish the book and I'm not shy about DNFing. I did especially enjoy everything to do with Rocky, and again the sense of urgency and impending doom was compelling. 

The main sci-fi book I would recommend is Embassytown by China Mieville. Loved the writing, and there was a psychological realism to the characters that I could not get enough of.","lxrvhgi"

If we are discussing whether you agree with the inherent message / deeper meaning, etc. - I think not everyone will agree with everything, the execution lacks subtlety. Though I agree with some of the stuff the book tried to say. Not much to ponder about. Are you looking for a book to read/ listen to while doing random things and pass some time? YES. Are you looking for something deep and moving to dive into? NO.

If you ask me if I will look for similar books - yes, again.

Those Across the River (werewolves, southern Georgia circa 1935) was my first time reading any of  Buehlmans work, one thing I can definitely say is that I really enjoy how the author uses different historical time periods and the superstitions of the time to really fuel the horror part of it. :) I think it’s definitely worth a read, not very difficult in terms of medieval language either.","lxva92i"

It reminds me a lot of what Tolkein wrote about creating a world instead of just a story (different, although, since it does take place in the real world, lol).

I guess I'll find out.","lxt4sdo"

Would definitely recommend The Goldfinch but it is a bit slower.","lxvdjrr"

"lxxkdbh","SmothyCoffee","2024-11-19 14:38:05 UTC","Aw the movie will always be on top I think. Spirited Away is probably another one of my faves but I love putting Totoro on before bed (even ended up getting a cat bus tattoo lol) 

  
So are the sequels more or less separate stories then? Will defos give them ago, I really like the writing style and honestly find Sophie and her ways of thinking really quite funny in the book","lxxhr5p"

"lxrzo29","julieputty","2024-11-18 16:33:14 UTC","I think the Felix ones aren't quite as tight in the pacing but the feel is very similar. He's also a smidge nicer to his MCs than his dad and does fewer standalone MCs (these might be related).","lxryy97"

"lxxn34o","RaineShadow0025","2024-11-19 14:53:21 UTC","Totoro is great too, and Kiki's delivery service.

Yeah, it's not a direct sequel. Howl and Sophie do appear in them, but we follow different characters at first, and it's a different setting. You'll see when you read it.","lxxkdbh"
