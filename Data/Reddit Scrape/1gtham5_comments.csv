Chomsky is reflexively anti-American, which while it may show a lot of the USA's bad spots, also leads to a bunch of really bad positions like supporting Russia against Ukraine, China against Tibet, and denying the Khmer Rouge genocide, which killed **1/4 of the Cambodian population**.

But I think the argument stated--that American foreign policy is driven by corporations and sold to the public through fake idealism--is actually true, or at least was until about 2015. God knows the British, Russian, and Spanish empires did the same, though they were talking about British civilization, communism, or God.

What's interesting to me is that the sort of non-interventionism previously the province of leftists (not liberals!) is now increasingly taken up by the right, for nativist and isolationist reasons. The remaining neocons have been kicked out of the Republican party and are now, if active at all, with the Democrats--look at what William Kristol and Liz Cheney have been up to lately. (It has political implications--I talked to a lady with three sons who was thinking about voting Trump because she was worried about one of them getting drafted in a war Kamala might start.)

What Chomsky offers as a critic of US foreign policy is a drumbeat of what's bad. He never points to anything good, because that's not his point, it's only to tell you what's bad. This academic says he's come to believe that's better than what apologists for US policy offer. And it's true, with a very politicized topic like foreign policy, much of what's written is to justify one side or the other, not to enlighten the reader.

Chomsky has the advantage of being anti establishment so people starting to realize it's not always as you're told tend to feel like their eyes have been opened by his stuff.

But, foreign policy is a bunch of complex problems carried out by very imperfect humans, such as the vast majority of political leaders and functionaries. So it's all filled with mistakes, evil motives and misunderstandings, to name a defects. By focusing 100% on what's wrong, Chomsky offers a wildly distorted picture of US foreign policy. Sometimes he's right, certainly US foreign policy has had some very bad parts. But you could say the same for any nations foreign policy or any groups of nations, like the UN for example or any of the alliances.

And that's where Chomsky is not helpful. He starts his inquiry with what's wrong with US foreign policy, looks for flaws in every action, and ends with what's wrong, so you get a sort on one trick pony or as Orwell put it in his essay on Dickens, one more ""smelly little ideology""",""

"lxnlfjg","Dimpleshenk","2024-11-17 21:31:19 UTC","I've read a ton of Chomsky and think he is a great intellectual and admire his work. That said, I take a lot of issue with the omissions inherent within his body of work. He is completely focused on the abuses and damages of U.S. policy thoughtout the 20th and now 21st century, but he piles on that topic so single-mindedly that he does not provide balanced or comparative commentary with things being done by other world powers. I know he doesn't subscribe to the idea of Pax Americana, but he rarely discusses the alternatives in-depth at all. Chomsky also will lay out a ton of facts and details about American intervention, abuse, control, hegemony and then leave the reader with nothing when it comes to the question: What should the U.S. actually do instead? What should we do to fix these problems? Chomsky asks big, big questions and then he leaves the answers dangling and empty. It's like he just complains, complains, complains, and then shrugs. Even if his complaints about ""the problem"" are true and well-established, why has his advanced intellect spent so little time and energy on the 2nd half of the equation: The solution to the problem? Chomsky's biggest ""solution"" in many of his books has been simply that we must commit to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Okay, I am on-board with that -- but is that it? That's way too easy and a total cop-out. Chomsky could recommend all sorts of programs for U.S. to reduce intervention, intevene more reponsibily and productively, cooperate with other nations more effectively, reforms in the UN to give its decisions more teeth, reforms to that the US can't easily veto UN decisions, or something. But Chomsky rarely goes into that, just mentioning it briefly and then moving on to his vague ""human rights"" statements.

Also, Chomsky spends so much time writing about U.S. abuses but doesn't stack them up against the abuses and likely abuses of other major industrialized nations and forces. The U.S. pulled all kinds of shit all over the world to shore up its power, but now China and Russia are spreading their power, cooperating, consolidating, and making major movies to overtake the U.S. And guess what? Both of their governments and political cultures are \\*way\\* more genocidal, authoritarian, and anti-free-speech, anti-freedom-principle (even as lip service) than U.S./Western culture is. Chomsky has acknowledged this at a low level from time to time, but it seems that his ""wheelhouse"" is to pile on about U.S./West abuses and so he avoids comparative issues regarding the other major forces and the benefits of the U.S./West at least being in a position to promote human rights as being vastly preferable to the alternative, which is governments overtaking the U.S./West when they have absolutely no cultural or social concern or incentive to promote human rights whatsoever. In fact we know fully that China, for example, will not only destroy human rights but destroy the free flow of any and all communication while executing and silencing all dissenters with extreme prejucide. Chomsky could at least factor the alternatives into his ongoing, thorough discussions and analysis, but he tends to get really suddenly terse and tight-lipped about those topics, whereas he can fill two-hour lectures with litanies of negative details about things the U.S. did in the 1950s in Laos, or in the early 1970s in Latin America (and again, of course Chomsky is right, and there's nothing inherently wrong with informing people about those topics).

It's also generally strange how little Chomsky addresses issues about science (such as global warming), religious culture and history (and how that plays into abuses by the U.S. and all other nations), and the highest-level decisions and powers of the International Monetary Fund and other prime movers and shakers. Yes, he describes them and describes what they do, but he gives very little information about what their actual plans might be, who is at the top (name names), what their ideologies are, and the nitty gritty of how they pull strings. Chomsky is always at one particular level of detail -- neither philosophically wide, nor nuts-and-bolts detailed -- but in a general zone of newspaper-level information that describes the basics but doesn't delve into the fine areas. I always read or listen to Chomsky with great interest and hunger, and find myself feeling like he left out the most important questions and details, like he made a road map and said ""now you go figure out the rest, I don't have time to get into the whys and hows, I'm just painting a general picture here.""",""

That's not a conclusion from looking at all information in context, but rather an axiomatic starting point, from which he must then gather what information exists to support that.  And if or when that is insufficient, downplay the information which contradicts that, or invent information that exaggerates that.

Which is not to say there aren't horrible things in the United States's history which ought to be pointed out and talked about.  But people never seem to walk away from a Chomsky book with a *better* overall view of the world and the United State's place in it.

Older liberals tended to be closer to free-speech absolutism--it was a **big** difference between the American and European left. There was a famous case where the ACLU defended the American Nazi Party's right to march down Skokie in 1977. They even did so in Charlottesville in 2017, which led to a fall in fundraising and their shifting on defending the free-speech rights of Nazis.

No such 'excuse' for Cambodia as far as I know--he seems to have distrusted the reports and never admitted he got it wrong. For the Khmer Rouge, I suspect, like many intellectuals, he fell into the common belief that the USA is the world's only imperial power.

Other U.S. oil companies would have liked to invest there, as well, but U.S. sanctions remained firmly in place.

He claims that the US somehow orchestrated the breakup of Yugoslavia. Imam from the region and I can tell you - Yugoslavia fell because of decades of pent up resentment against Serbian jingoism and suppression of the many Yugoslav ethnicities.


The first time the people's of Yugoslavia had the chance to get out, they did. And Serbia, with few exceptions, responded with brutal genocidal violence, which lead to even more resistance and desire of the suppressed to get independence.


He has this imprrialist-putinist idea that peoples in Eastern Europe have no free will when they want to ally with western powers. He claims that any desire of a eastern European nation to move away from the kremilin must be orchestrated by America. 


In reality, we, Eastern Eurpeans have agency and actually want to have a strong ally (like America) to help us resist destructive Russian imperial power, which has tried to erase our independence and destroy our cultures. Make nommistake, even without such an ally, eastern Europeans hate Russia with a passion and will resist any encroachment and ""sphere of influence"" bs.





Chomsky, however, claims that whenever we want to ally with the US or Western Europe, we do it because we are somehow manipulated, somehow forced into it. But when we move towards Moscow, this is somehow good and understandable.


This is deeply paternalistic and insulting. He can go f himself, with his shallow imperialist analysis. His take on the world has no basis in reality.

Vladimir Putin is very happy to use Chomsky's works describing U.S. abuses as a basis for his own propaganda and falses narratives justifying Russian invasions and abuses. Putin very much will say, ""I was forced to invade Ukraine because of CIA meddling in (blah blah blah)"" but Putin is doing the exact kind of meddling shit (or worse kinds) than Chomsky describes about the U.S., and Putin has a long history of ordering assassinations of journalists, poisoning or imprisonment of dissidents, and utter evil actions. Chomsky soft-pedals these topics and stays on his own topic of criticizing the West, and it's fucking imbalanced and weird. 

You also have other people like Glenn Greenwald, who started off as a gay porn producer and who has promoted sex-tourism that focuses on the ability to travel to places like Brazil and hook up with underage/teenage male prostitutes. Greenwald then remade himself as a modern-day Chomsky, using the Chomsky formula to pose as a journalist, and Greenwald fooled enough people into thinking he was a modern-day Chomsky that he ended up with a cushy column at The Guardian. Greenwald then had a huge, Pulitzer-prize-level  story dropped in his lap by the naive Edward Snowden, and they all ended up (surprise suprise!) in Russia basically giving Vladimir Putin a big gift-wrapped information-rich present. Greenwald is now in the anti-West (but mainly extreme-right, which overlaps) camp, carrying water for Peter Thiel's power-grabbing interests, and Snowden is Putin's subject -- living in Russia and obligated to never, ever say anything critical of Putin/Russia or be executed/""disappeared""/etc.

Chomsky knows full well his contribution to the quasi-intellectual, bad-faith propaganda discourse -- to the extent that his own high-level, well-meaning career has been twisted into a tool for other purposses. But Chomsky is so fucking weak/embarrassed/whatever that he doesn't forcefully disavow it. Chomsky has admitted that Greenwald is scum, for example, but avoids the topic because ""they used to be friends.""

So Chomsky’s position of the holocaust is that it was a genocide because we have records of high ranking nazi leaders planning to kill all the Jews in Europe. If you don’t have records like that, it may be inaccurate to call something a genocide.","lxmwurd"

Articles like [this](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-rebuts-chomsky-s-theory-of-language-learning/) quite astoundingly (and funnily) claim to refute the theory by providing evidence which supports it.

>The research suggests a radically different view, in which learning of a child’s first language does not rely on an innate grammar module. Instead the new research shows that young children use various types of thinking that may not be specific to language at all—such as the ability to classify the world into categories (people or objects, for instance) and to understand the relations among things.

Then with pol pot, he’s right to doubt how the US uses its power over perception, but he should also be carefully examining how the Khmer Rouge exercised power over perception *given the US effort particularly*. Of course they were spending all efforts to fool him and other western intelligentsia, wouldn’t the US effort necessitate it?

And so on and so on.

Well first of all it's not so simple as ""Chomsky is a genocide denier"". With regard to Cambodia there are some writings of his from the 70s in which he claims that the massacres were in the thousands of people instead of tens of thousands. That's not the same as some nazi claiming the holocaust never happened.

Second, in the current reality even a genocider can have some positive aspects or be right about some things, look no further than all the Biden vs Trump discussions. Biden has spent all his life defending the American establishment, including supporting heinous war crimes... yet people will say (correctly) that when voting they have to think if the alternative (Trump) could be even worse.","lxmipxx"

2. America rarely intervenes on the ostensible basis of free trade. Even if that is the root of it, in order to sell it to the American public, the state has to dress up its activities in all sorts of moral language. This is the same as every imperial power. The inconsistency of
American intervention is because it fails to serve it’s supposed ideals and values. Instead, it serves its “national interest”, which wants foreign markets open to American investment on good terms for maximal profits. The principle it follows is not free trade, it’s just economic prosperity.

3. I don’t believe even postwar American power has consistently supported free trade in principle, even when the free trade doesn’t happen to explicitly benefit American special interests.

No it hasn't, largely because Chomsky never actually said that all languages have to have infinite recursion.

This is a misunderstanding that was spread by Daniel Everett in *Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes* - a book which catalogues the unique Piraha language of Brazil. Everett noted that Piraha doesn't feature recursion and tried to use this to disprove Chomsky's theory.

However, not only has Everett's report on the Piraha language itself come into question (there is some evidence to suggest that Piraha speakers do utilize recursion, albeit in a roundabout way), but his fundamental understanding of Chomsky is incorrect. Chomsky never argued that languages require recursion - rather, he simply stated that a concept of recursion is necessary for a being to be capable of language (i.e., it's not about having recursion, but being able to understand it). Chomsky and others pointed out that the Piraha largely speak Portuguese as a second language - which does feature recursion, showing that the Piraha are capable of understanding the concept.","lxn69h2"

That’s very sensible, because free trade benefits the country with the most power and leverage to use it to its advantage. The problem is that free trade agreements and international trade organizations are designed to prevent underdeveloped countries from using the very policies that are necessary to grow. Countries that refuse to buy into the rules of the system are punished for it.

2. Except free trade agreements get in the way of democracy, for the very reason I described above. If a country’s population wants to protect their industries to nurture growth, free trade agreements prevent them from doing that.

3. You don’t understand. The US will oppose a free trade agreement between two enemies even if it doesn’t exclude anyone else.

Morality or altruism has never been the only basis for entering a war, ever. This is not a criticism of just the USA, but all humans and countries. No country risks their resources and citizens’ lives if there is no prospect of geopolitical benefit, whether that’s gaining some ideological (religious), political, or resource advantage.

Russia had the largest front and did the most ground fighting, but without US imports it would have been a much tougher fight for them.  Additionally, the final blows were only possible after Nazi  ground forces were split between three fronts.

US aid after the war was specifically mutually beneficial.  Both the US and Europe benefitted greatly from both US aid and the US becoming a superpower.","lxnv3e7"

In long term it is putting quite lot at risk. If obvious land grab is ignored, firstly, Russia will continue (Georgia, Crimea, Donbass, Ukraine see the pattern?). Baltics probably next, or Moldova before that. Secondly, we will see nuclear programs all over the world, because what else can you do if you are middle size country with aggressive neighbour claiming more and more land with almost no consequences? We haven't seen anything like that in Europe for over century.

\\> only support the idea of supporting Ukraine in a way that it doesn't threaten their safety

So? What is your point here? Chomsky don't want to do that EVEN in way that doesn't threaten his safety. Your stance is that people who support Ukraine are suppose to enlist immediately otherwise this is hypocrisy??

And while I wouldn’t say they were fighting an uncleared war in the Pacific Ocean when escorting Allied convoys, they were indeed supplying Allies via the Lend Lease Act which was beneficial to bolstering Western defences without directly engaging in the war.

I guess my point, to clarify, is that I believe no country to be moral. I don’t think the US to be above or below other countries, rather equally as corrupt as all machines of self-interest driven rule and policy, which I believe all tribes, proto-states, and countries to be.","lxnwjrk"

This says a lot about you.

Being obsessed about someone going 1 mile over the speed limit instead of murderers does not make you a criminal expert. It makes you a weirdo and at least a useful idiot for the real criminals.
