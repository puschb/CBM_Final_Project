I‚Äôd like to take it in another direction. A lot of the books I‚Äôve disliked over the years have been because I missed some crucial plot point while reading and came away feeling either confused or dissatisfied. I now try to make an effort to read a brief synopsis of I‚Äôm starting in on a new author.

As a very lowbrow example, I recently tried reading ‚ÄúShogun.‚Äù I hated it. Then I watched the show. Upon returning to the book, it made a lot more sense and my enjoyment of it spiked.

In short, certain activities and products can be unenjoyable to people who do not expect to enjoy them or who do not understand them. Dust jackets and synopses are our friends!

As for the letters themselves, I got the impression there must be a lot of women out there just now finding their voices to say bad words out loud. It was basically akin to what I call ""cum & quiver"" fan fiction. And we know there is no shortage of that.

I listened to the audiobook which is what I do now. The letters were read by various women of different ethnicities, which was a nice touch.

I was trying to stick with it but bored waiting for it to get to the point, when it was fairly obvious exactly where it was going by a few chapters in. I ultimately couldn't finish it, I just read a synopsis and thought yep.


Now that said, I don't think that's the book or Crouch's fault. I have diagnosed issues with maintaining attention but ironically almost never had any issues reading for hours on end. I've always devoured masses of sci fi, usually quite quickly and rarely had issues finishing. I just think his style just doesn't suit me. I think it's probably better for people who have a more typical reading style. Possibly less familiar with the genre would help, but honestly I don't think plot predictability would have even been a problem (how many authors and books are truly original) for me if only the plot wasn't pausing to smell the roses and make sure you're still paying attention every 2 minutes.","lu18he9"

It probably speaks to the Japanese far more than white westerners. It's a fascinating book and I loved reading it but it has aged out considerably compared to the pop sensation it probably was back then.

I just think this book is impossible to understand completely unless you're Japanese in Japan, it seems wholly personal to that space. You also have to contextualize it in the times of student revolution in the late '60s or whenever the book was placed, it has massive historical context I didn't even really understand. But it's a book I think about far more than many others, it's really a very individual, idiosyncratic and powerful experience.

Wisdom requires integrating knowledge and experience from a myriad of different sources, bringing them altogether and understanding how to balance them.

In my case growing up as a Muslim brown girl in a school where the only other POC were your siblings and 9/11 happened when you were 6 years old you become so aware of bring other and having to continuously suppress yourself or ignore racism and micro aggressions so you can be seen as one of ‚Äòthe good ones‚Äô. Watching your parents trying to report to the police people throwing lit fireworks through our letterbox and them dismissing it. Also, because I was lighter skinned and have more Eurocentric features than my siblings, it was assumed I was mixed race and hearing comments like if you just had lighter hair you could look white like it was a good thing.

then going to a secondary school and university that was incredibly diverse, having POC friends for the first time, not having to constantly explain your culture, no one making fun of the food your mum packs you, or asking what the henna on your hands was etc was a revelation . And that latent rage in you for all those years of having to ignore the prejudice you faced.

I doubt her recounting of her parent‚Äôs coparenting relationship entirely and honestly think she is either delusional and looking at her childhood through rose tinted glasses or she‚Äôs a liar. Maybe both‚Äîthe easiest lies to believe are the ones we tell ourselves, I suppose.

"lu38ovv","electric_wolfman","2024-10-27 23:06:15 UTC","I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm using that term incorrectly but I‚Äôll try to hit some points that bother me. I‚Äôll also admit I‚Äôm working on my first 52 book challenge this year and was ready to get this one done so I may have missed important subtleties that clear everything up. 

The hobbits have a long way to go on an incredibly difficult journey, and they are delayed in getting started, but they always seem to be at the right place at the right time to meet just the right people that will help them in the journey. Just missed the cloaked riders as they are leaving the shire, Tom Bombodil shows up at the exact time to save them, Merry and Pippen escape at just the right time so they can meet Treebeard just before the Ents are needed at Helms Deep. The Orcs decide to kill each other just before Sam finds Frodo. Sam and Frodo meet the marching Orcs at just the right place where they can blend in to enter Modor. 

Gandalf miraculously survives and comes back to the party just before he‚Äôs needed again. His memory is different but somehow he remembers the exact things needed to help the story move along, then he‚Äôs somehow just the same as usual. 

Last thing I‚Äôll mention is Frodo has an unbelievable (to me, in the world of the established story) attachment to the ring right at the end. Gollum‚Äôs relationship with it makes sense, he had it all that time and it changed him. Bilbo had the ring for decades, wore it often , but still gave it up when Gandalf was just kind of mean to him. Frodo had it for a few months, wore it a less than five times (I think - very little at least), but couldn‚Äôt part with it way at the end of that journey. I realize it‚Äôs all powerful but that doesn‚Äôt align for me with how it impacted less strong individuals, and just seemed like a convenient way to end that part of the story (and Gollums).","lu2si7m"

The book is about humanity, about connection and how when we strip literally everything else away, who and what are we as a society. How do we collectively relate and live when there is nothing else.

I had a similar reaction to the Alchemist and wondered why on Earth people were raving about such a trite childish story dressed up in mock profundity.


But since then, I've noticed how once you start understanding the world in a new way, it's very hard see the world the way you did before. What seemed like the best you could do with the information at hand can seems obliviously naive now. Thoughts like ""how could you not notice all the signs that was a bad idea?"" Or, ""how could anyone who is not a simpleton not know how to handle something so simple and obvious?"" can naturally spring to mind. Even knowing you aren't a simpleton and objectively struggled with those concepts and situations when you were younger!¬†


We all learn different things at different paces and wisdom isn't a linear process, so even though I struggle, I make an effort to accept when someone struggles with an issue which seems obvious to me, that it's no mark against them, because there was always a time it wasn't easy for me either and there's always things which they could do easily, which for me to attempt would leave me looking like flailing fool in their eyes too.¬†","lu22dpc"

Ironically, teenage angst and anxiety are too familiar, still too much the defining features of their own lives. You have to have some distance from that time to realize not only that *you* were the annoying, whining teenager (something that is just too painful for may teens to admit ""hitting too close to home""), but to have compassion for that stage of life.

I think a lot of well meaning high school English teachers assigned it in the hopes that it would inspire fruitful self-reflection but instead many students just put their own disowned adolescent self-loathing on the book","lu1x7e8"

The audiobook that I have 12 hours long and that will probably take me a few days to read unless I get so, compulsive about it that I must finish it ASAP or something because of how intriguing or interesting the book is. And I will also be switching back-and-forth between where the crawdad sings and also homers the Odyssey, another audiobook. I listen to because of my blindness. And the crawdad book will be my primary book where it will get the most, and then the Odyssey is something that I read, one chapter at a time and I just finished chapter 5. Which I think is 33% of the way to the Book and chapter is a couple hours long. But it‚Äôs not a hard and fast rule necessarily go back-and-forth, but I like to use different types of books aspallet cleansers going back-and-forth between them


When I am done with the crawdad book, I will come back and try to reply to this post just to give an update about how I felt. Thank you for the reply.","lugornm"
"lv1z8ro","One_Engineering8030","2024-11-02 18:21:25 UTC","Hello, this is my follow up. I just finished reading where the crawdads sings. As a sidenote, I listened to the audiobook because I am blind, and that may add a lot to the characters in that I was hearing them performed rather than coming up with my own Voices for them, etc. But it doesn‚Äôt really affect my take on the story itself. That‚Äôs just a sidenote because I know a lot of people make a big distinction on a readers opinion if it‚Äôs an audiobook rather than on an actual physical hardcopy. 


I am glad I read the book as I found a lot of it interesting. My favorite parts were everything to do with the main characters interactions with the town while growing up and also her figuring out a way to survive after her family had abandoned her. And most especially her life out on the marsh as she not only had to thrive in the environment, but also became more observant than me standard residence of the area. 

I do have some of my own personal biases when it comes to certain certain genres in the context of the other half of the story, which turns out to be a who done it. I was thrilled with the first chapter, but then in the second chapter when I started springing forward in time to describe the scene of a dead body being found I was kind of upset because I‚Äôm not necessarily a fan of who done it at all and the minute I saw that swift I knew it was gonna be a who done it and I also spent the entire rest of the book, completely distracted from The story of her survival and getting to know the very few people that she interacted with into seeing how the author is going to try to turn the tables on the reader and offer, twisting after twisting as a lot of these types of books do. It‚Äôs hard for me to not try to solve it and such which is why I typically don‚Äôt read them, but I can say that that half of the book through the investigation Turned me off mainly because I just wanted to get back to the other half. 

And I don‚Äôt want to reveal any spoilers here for anyone else who may stumble across this discussion thread, but I pretty much knew how it was going to play out unless the author decided to go against character and just do something completely different with the players involved. I‚Äôve seen these types of movies and read these kinds of books before where the table is turned in such away and so many red hearings are thrown in. You‚Äôre like oh yeah they‚Äôre trying to give an explanation for how this could‚Äôve happened or trying to throw the readers off because that clue, which isn‚Äôt an actual clue, but red hearing, etc. 

And my one genuine complaint about the pacing and story ark of the story is that the last 25% of the book or so is a courtroom battle. And because nothing had been resolved at that point it just felt like a courtroom battle for the sake of having one in the story because I had already presumed the ending. I just had to wait for it to get there and in between me and the final solution was that courtroom battle. And no amount of painting character to be appear innocent, or another character to have had strong motive, and then another character to have yet another strong motive none of that really affected the fact that the ending was telegraphed time and time again throughout the course of the story through the actions taken by the main characters and the observations made by the main character throughout the story. 

And like I said earlier, I do come with some vices regarding certain types of stories, and one of those types of stories that I tend to be biased against is the uneducated town OutKast turning out to be a genuine savant who just happens to be not only wiser, but also more intelligent And observant with more life experience and every single other person involved in the story. It‚Äôs not necessarily as bad as the way other stories present characters that no one makes any presumptions about other than their trash that also turns out to be a huge savant, whether it be mathematical or otherwise , I‚Äôm looking at Goodwill hunting, but still it never quite delivers the payoff for me personally. One thing I can say about the way it‚Äôs for trade in this particular story is the main character did lift life at the Isle of the nature and the bugs and the birds, but they observed, and they did see things 24 seven living alone and that environment that other people with all their books and all their degrees, and all their studies Can‚Äôt quite figure out the room because they don‚Äôt live in the environment as immersed as the main character has been their whole life. 

And I don‚Äôt want to say anything more obvious to reveal spoilers because since I am blind, I cannot hide the stuff behind spoiler tags as I am using voice to text to compose this message, as I do not have a workable or efficient keyboard on this device cause it‚Äôs touchscreen , but I do have a lot of thoughts of how the author tried the hardest to make the reader fall in love with a certain character or characters by painting them as much more innocent than the other people in that setting happened to be, which only made it much more obvious which way the author was leaning when it was gonna come time for a final reveal. 


Anyway, it‚Äôs much easier for me to complain about things, all things, than it is to give proper praise for something so I hope this post doesn‚Äôt come across as though I‚Äôm trying to crap on everything you love about the book or whatever. Because I did enjoy the book There are certain aspects of it that don‚Äôt happen to fall into the categories of books. I typically want to read and a lot of that is because I‚Äôve just seen so many detective movies and the like and red detective novels in the wild. This book wasn‚Äôt necessarily try or had done before and this way, I just find myself falling into my old routine. I‚Äôve been distracted from the main story by the plot device who done it. And I was really disappointed on one hand because the book took place in North Carolina when my personal experience has been in the Louisiana swamp and the crawdads down there, and because I went into this book without knowing anything about it other than I picked it up from a recommendation thread I just assumed that the crawdads would be down there so the disappointment is really only that I‚Äôve been to the Louisiana swamp and I‚Äôve spent months there, but I‚Äôve never been in the North Carolina swamp only the main cities, but that‚Äôs just a laughable take on my part. I‚Äôm not being critical of it anyway. 

Anyway, thank you for requesting my feedback after I finish the book. It‚Äôs what really drove me to set aside the odyssey by Homer that I was halfway through reading in order to really stick with this so I could shape and opinion and share it with you. I hope that was sufficient and again I apologize if half of this is not legible or understandable because I‚Äôm using voice to text and God knows what AutoCorrect is gonna do to this wall of text. I just created. Have a great day.","lugornm"

Since you wrote such a long and thorough review I did take the time to read out of courtesy, but I actually wanted you to tell me what you thought about the 7 1/2 deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle! That‚Äôs the book I was advocating for people to stick out the slow first 100 pages for in order to get to the really good stuff. So let me know what you think once you‚Äôve finished listening to that one. üòâ Happy listening!","lv1z8ro"

I‚Äôm really sorry about that wall of text. I have not finished the 7 1/2 deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle but because I was talking about it the other day and because I blasted through this one first I did plan on getting back to it to finish. I know it‚Äôs a relatively short book compared to the crawdad book which means it‚Äôs probably gonna be Another two or three days before I finish that one. I do have a lot of stuff going on on Monday. Thank you for your reply and setting me straight, I‚Äôm sorry about all that spam that wasn‚Äôt necessarily expected on your part. But I will finish that book because it was already on my to do list. Have a great day and it‚Äôs possible that I will have an equally long reply then. The difference here is is because this is an actual Agatha Christie book and I know going in that it‚Äôs a crime novel. I‚Äôm not gonna be surprised. Be a turn of events at the field like I was with crawdad where it also had a, very strong thread of done crime mystery so to speak, so because I know what I‚Äôm getting into. I‚Äôm not necessarily adverse to seeing it play out so I don‚Äôt want you to think that if this book is like the other one, I‚Äôm gonna react exactly the same way. The other Book just started trying to do something a little different and then went down the path. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to which is why I said the things that I did. Anyway, next time you hear from me should be after I‚Äôm done with that book in a few days. Have a great week.","lv34ke8"
"lv43jnm","One_Engineering8030","2024-11-03 01:39:34 UTC","Oh, here is a small follow up to my prior reply, I said Agatha Christie by accident. I meant Stewart Curtin. I was corrected when I opened up my book player and it read out the author name, and I laughed because the Agatha Christie book I was thinking of, something else on my to read list. But I‚Äôve got this thing loaded up and I‚Äôll get back to you in a couple days. Sorry for all of the nonsensical confusion on my part.","lv34ke8"
"lw18eqb","One_Engineering8030","2024-11-08 05:29:55 UTC","Hello, I just finished the 7 1/2 deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle. 

And as a brief reminder because I am blind, I listened to the audiobook version. And I was going to give a couple thoughts. 

This was one very very complex story to fully grasp on a single read through. If I want to understand every single maneuver made by each character and each persona, I would have to read the book again a time or two. 


That‚Äôs not exactly a complaint because there are several books that I sometimes have to reread completely or at least particular chapters in order to fully grasp the message that the author might be trying to convey, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm letting you know that I‚Äôve only given the book a single pass so far, I haven‚Äôt reread it or anything like that. And also, unlike a lot of other people might have faltered within the first 100 pages. I did not have any trouble being hooked or staying interested in the story during those early chapters. I think I know what you meant when you said the story suddenly connects or hooks you or speeds up at a very certain point early in the book if only readers would stay long enough to get there, but I had no problem staying it staying up until the point the first reveal of the situation was made, and the explanation about the rules that must be followed throughout the rest of the book. 

I can also say that by the time we got to the seventh persona so to speak, I was thoroughly overwhelmed with the number of messages being left behind and the number of conversations with different people from different points of view that had taken place up until that point and so on. Trying to keep track of all of the evidence Was also a bit of a task for me personally given my current situation because it‚Äôs really not easy for me to quickly jump back-and-forth in a book to find out why a particular item or discussion is explicitly relevant in the actual scene taken place at that moment. I did do a lot of jumping back-and-forth between The very beginning of the book that listed the invitation and the names of all the people that were invited to the party and their jobs or relation to the family or rules in the party itself, simply, so I could keep track of which guy was a lawyer which guy was a doctor which guy was a artist. And luckily that was easy to bookmark and jump back-and-forth to when I needed it because it was just one very brief section that listed all of that. Whereas it‚Äôs a lot more difficult when I‚Äôm trying to keep track of the ownership of something like a gun or a piece of board game or something 


So other than some of the obstacles that I face in that regard on my first read through, I can say that this is the sort of story that normally I would probably grab a notepad and keep notes for myself as I go to trace things like timelines or the daily activities of one persona versus another through that same day, etc. I did not have the benefit of doing so I haven‚Äôt tried to do anything that complex since I‚Äôve gone blind last year and I know basic braille. The truth is since I haven‚Äôt tried taking notation like that I don‚Äôt really have the practice skills or efficiency to really do it effectively and so I didn‚Äôt do that in this particular case. I also thought of taking audio notes on my phone, but I quickly realize that juggling through a bunch of note files while reading in order to get to Pate info for notes that I took for myself was a little more cumbersome than it might have been had tackled this job after having a lot more experience being blind, and trying to accomplish something Like that. 

As for the story itself, I think it was highly inspired, and I can compare it to a number of other movies or stories that I‚Äôve read, not necessarily in the negative way where I‚Äôm trying to accuse the author of getting all of his inspiration from those places, but just in a way where I would look at the story through the lens of a movie, like memento by Christopher Nolan, or the movie knives out, or a movie like Groundhog Day with Bill Murray. Just different lenses I would look at this story through because of how certain parts of the books would resonate with me. 

So I‚Äôm glad that I read the story all the way through, it was a long read at 17 hours or so, and it has given me a lot to chew on if I ever go through a second or third read through to better understand a lot of the actions being taken by the numerous other characters in a scene as observed by our main character. 

In the end, I think that much like a lot of other who done it type Books this one did an amazing job of layering twist upon twist motivation upon motivation and opportunity upon opportunity for the characters involved. 

I also liked the morality struggle that the main character had at the end of the book with their known motivations versus their supposed motivations as guest by another party, and then the final decision to reject, and or accept their innermost feelings and what that would mean for the different parties moving forward. a little introspection in that regard is always welcome by me, and I also like how the book would layer the main characters, actions, and motivations with those of the persona that they have inherited for any particular day and how those other personas would inform and control/inspire a lot of the feelings and actions taken by the main character often much to the main characters own chagrin and revulsion. it was an interesting concept that had the main character struggling to come to terms with their desire to do something and their taste for it without forcing the main character to have an actual entity of the persona that they‚Äôre constantly debating with a conversation mentally or something. Yes both parties might be in control and one since or another at any given time, But it‚Äôs less that they‚Äôre struggling against each other and more that one can just force the hand so to speak without any input or pushback from the other. 

OK, I think I have chatted your ear off quite enough MS post, ha ha. Once again, I hope that this post is somewhat legible and understandable and I apologize if it just seems like a bunch of nonsense. Have a great weekend.","lv34ke8"

I have not personally read Where the Crawdads Sing, I read enough reviews to convince me I probably would not like it. I went in 7 1/2 Deaths blind (pun intended üòâ) so did not expect the journey it took me on, which might have made it all the more thrilling for me when the pace did pick up.","lv43jnm"
"lv4d8rj","One_Engineering8030","2024-11-03 02:41:57 UTC","Yes, I also like to go in the Books blind, because with the audiobooks that I listen to from the library, they all have introductions from the library of Congress that tried to give a description of the book kind of like what‚Äôs on the back of a book jacket. And those things have have a mountain of spoilers a lot of the time. And I don‚Äôt like to know specifics in that regard before I start a book. Because while some people do not see a problem with spoilers, I do feel like it takes a lot out of a book to know specific events, or even an overall theme of where a story was going before I start one because I like to be taken on a ride and a journey with no known destination.


In that sense, I am also approaching the Evelyn Hardcastle book the same way because other than some recommendations that have been made in certain request threads, I don‚Äôt know the specifics about the book other than like you said the story is very wonderful and really picks up the further you get into it. And I love , not knowing what yet to come. And thank you for your comments about my replies. Sometimes I forget to stop talking and actually carriage return.","lv4boe0"
