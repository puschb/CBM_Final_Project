i don't really feel right actively cannibalizing the more privileged one, but i dont put my own contributions in there anymore.   i also try to put in multiple books at a time, because a free library with one or two items in it is just sad and doesn't inspire anyone else to start using it.",""

"lup7cd8","Antique_Ad_1635","2024-10-31 14:20:19 UTC","Options for helping fuel your local (less well 'funded') free library:

\\*When you resell your books, always ask them if they will give you back the books they won't put on the shelves, because you want to put them in the free library. (Most stores now just take everything even if they don't think they can sell them, but if you mention free libraries most of them will give them back to you for that purpose. They want to help too.)

\\*There are also often library sales where they will sell you kids books for a discount in bulk, which is good free-library fodder. Especially if your local Friends Of The Library group knows what your goal is, they'll help out too, as they end up with donations they can't resell.

\\*As OP stated, Goodwill/HPB Outlets and other thrift stores will often do bulk sales on ""poor condition"" books, many of which are sold by the pound and actually have decent reads in them.

\\*Hosting a ""book drive"", similar to a food drive, in your neighborhood get surprising results. (If you're part of a community, like a church or whatever, you can often organize a big one of these and have books for multiple donations.)

\\*Make sure your friends with younger kids know that when the books (and toys!) fall out of favor with their young ones that you have a place to take them that won't reject them for 'condition issues'. I found out a lot of these get thrown out!",""

"lupu8w4","Jeciao","2024-10-31 16:21:52 UTC","I worked in a library in a diverse community with moderate poverty and above-average crime rates. Across the street was a shelter for people experiencing homelessness, and within walking distance were various businesses and schools. Our regular patrons included kids, teens, parents (mostly women), and individuals facing housing or mental health challenges. We used to have a book swap rack in the vestibule (an area not covered by the security camera) where patrons could take a book without checking it out and leave one if they had any to share. Only mass-market paperbacks were allowed. Once finished, they could return the book at the front desk, though people often put them back directly on the rack.

One day (I wasn’t on shift at the time), a man came in with a cart and took all the books. He repeated this on another occasion.

The reality in communities with limited resources is that a few people may misuse these services, impacting the whole community. We eventually moved the rack inside to prevent this again, something we should’ve done years ago, but in my five years working there, this was the only time our swap system was taken advantage of.

Unfortunately, incidents like this cause hesitation around supporting communities with honor-based systems, where there may be a greater risk of theft. It’s often the kids and families who would benefit most who miss out as a result. I don’t know what to say or what the solution is. I read another comment that mentioned people need income first, and books second. If we improve people’s lives, things like this might not happen. I like the thought of that.",""

"luro0mu","Deleted","2024-10-31 22:15:17 UTC","What makes me sad is the same thing. They installed 4 free little libraries in 2 housing properties. The 1st property the little library is on a hill for some reason & the door doesn’t stay shut. So the books just fallout. When they 1st installed them we were super excited but were only met with really old children books, bibles, devotional & board games that didn’t have all the pieces. We go right up the street to the park in a beater neighborhood that has a free little library & there are always so many good books. I often see parents putting new books or children getting a book or two when we’re at the park playing. I also noticed that reading is not encouraged in the area we stay in. So the books that were in the free little library when they 1st installed them the children ripped them up and they were just all over the property. I’m an avid reader & encourage my children to read to. I keep my books unless it’s a book I DNF then I put them in the free little library or I give them to a friend who may be more interested in it than me. For my children if they don’t have an emotional attachment to the book we ask friends and children around the neighborhood if they want any books. They also like to keep books but as they get older they get new books & grow out of their old books. So we can let them go more easier. I can say that since we started giving books to the neighborhood children that more of them are reading. I often get asked by one of the children if I can buy them a book & I go straight on ThriftBooks & get it for them. Our little library wasn’t even installed properly and is more for show than actual usage. I don’t donate to the free little libraries in the better neighborhoods because I find the children & give them the books.

We partnered with our local Half Priced Books store and they donated the books for our cart. This was run by parents with permission from the school. 

The school was 80% Hispanic and most students were in the ESL program. They loved the opportunity to have access to books. We had fiction and nonfiction. Some of the most popular books were nonfiction like kids cookbooks or how to write cursive handwriting.   

Most of these students had never been to a public library because their parents did not speak English or were undocumented so they were fearful of filling out any forms thinking they could be deported.  After finding that out I arranged for all the classes at the school to take field trips to the library where the students were able to get their own library cards.

I think it's a vicious cycle. If an upper income person goes to the library and a homeless person on drugs is attempting to bathe in the bathroom sink and there are kids starting fist fights and the elevator is currently stuck because 20 teenagers decided to pack into it and jump at the same time (a recurrent issue), then they'll say ""fuck this, I'll just buy my books."" Then when a levy for the library comes up the next election, they will vote against it because they don't use the library anyway.

Unless people learn to care for themselves and their neighborhood, it's not guaranteed to help if you just add more valuable items.

That's a pretty privileged take on the situation. 

It's very easy to have free libraries in more middle class and affluent areas, where both money and time are more abundant. Those libraries take quite a bit to setup and maintain, and rely on people donating books for free.

It's absolutely not fair to say that poorer communities don't value their kids, or education, or access to books.

One is by a busy mall and right next to a train line, absolutely premium location. It's almost always a total ghost town inside because the area has gotten rough. I've personally found a used, bloody needle half buried in the grass at that library and I'll just say, one needle buried in the grass where you just let your toddler play is enough - I don't go to that library anymore and I'm clearly not alone.

  
By contrast we have a much smaller, slightly crappier library that sits in an area that's not really great for foot traffic or near anything important but the area is safe and clean. This library is always PACKED. Every seat is taken, every computer is in use, kids are always seen hanging out in the kids section. It just shows that people won't use public libraries when they feel unsafe, no matter how good the library is, and that should be taken seriously.","lupmkqw"
"luqbgeg","Kindly-Article-9357","2024-10-31 17:51:05 UTC","My local library is a \\*gorgeous\\* building. When I was a kid, I absolutely loved being in there. I could and did spend hours in there, at least once a week. Not once do I ever remember seeing someone behave so badly they needed more than a warning to straighten up. On occasion a few teens might speak too loudly, but a stern shush from the librarian quickly put them back in line. It was accepted that people who were not able to abide by the expectations for respect of the quiet were not welcome. 

I tried to instill the same love of the library in my own kids, but things were already changing by then. I noticed way more unaccompanied kids who obviously weren't ready to be unsupervised in public. They demanded more time and resources from the staff to keep them from disturbing other patrons. 

I also think a big contributor was that local care homes started bringing severely disabled people to the library for outings, because it was free and a low-stim environment. I understand their reason for doing so, and yes, disabled people should have access to and be welcome everywhere anyone else is. Yes there should be some considerations extended for them that you don't extend to abled people. 

But it shouldn't be at the expense of others trying to utilize that space for its intended purpose. When you have a library that's supposed to be a quiet and low-stim place, and then you bring in groups of people who are not able to respect and preserve that quiet and low-stim place for others but can't be shushed because that's abelist, others \\*will\\* get upset and frustrated and stop using the place.

The last time I set foot in my library was 10 years ago. It was obvious the people in charge still loved it dearly, that they were still doing their best to put on amazing programming and to meet the needs of the community in spite of the challenges. But it was also full of mentally unstable and stinking people who are only there to kill time in the heat or AC until they have to leave. It's full of unattended and ill-behaved kids whose parents are using it as a free daycare. It's full of organizations using it to avoid paying for their own programming and spaces for mainstreaming profoundly disabled people.

These days the library devotes much of its resources to addressing the challenges they face managing its patrons. A lot of how they do this is by tailoring services to these groups. I don't need those services. The environment is incompatible with what I need and want in a library. Not only is it no longer an enjoyable place to be, it's no longer a \\*safe\\* place to be.

The key to having a successful, popular library, is you have to be brutal about “curating” the junk.

Once a week (trash day) I go in there and get rid of all of the books placed there by people who feel guilty about throwing out their old crap books. 

I toss the Hawaii tour guides from 1985, the college textbooks from 1990, and the really beat-up and discolored brown pulp fiction books (the small softcover books printed on cheap, thin paper).

Nobody is ever going to read any of those.  It’s never a lot, maybe two or three every week, but if you don’t do it, it will take over your library quickly.

Exactly. It's the ""crabs in a bucket"" effect. Those who steal the books, damage the education (and therefore future wealth) of those kids who're interested in the books. The reason they steal and sell the books, is because they were not educated to value the books as an educational tool themselves.

Education is also *certification*. The document that states someone has achieved a Bachelor of Science, for example, will likely be more accepted than the very same knowledge without the document. Speaking for states in the WEIRD demographic in particular.

Other than that, (formal and institutionalized) education isn't something one does alone at a desk by just reading. It's interacting with teachers, practice and feedback. It's children getting meals in school so they don't have to learn on an empty stomach. It's university students building networks.

Except it is false.  Your first sentence:

""The difference in behaviour explains why those areas are high income or low income""

Those families are not poor because their children cause trouble.  The kids behaviour does NOT explain why their families are in that situation/location.  There are absolutely some % of those kids who are perfectly well behaved - do you think they are less poor?  If the naught kids suddenly started being 100% well behaved would their parents economic situation instantly change?  That they'd just not poor because the kids stopped messing around?  No.  The behaviour is probably a symptom of their situation, but is is not the reason behind that situation.  So no, the difference in the kids behaviour does not explain why they're in a low income situation (otherwise the rich parents with dipship kids would also be poor right?).  So your statement was false.

The flip side is true though - that statistically being poor leads to worse outcomes so the behaviour is partly explained by the economic situations.  But just because A leads to B does mean B also leads to A.","luodtgu"

I think from my experience from a lot of kids from lower socioeconomic backgrounds that I tutored is that school is frustrating and they believe they can't do it. If you go to the r/teachers subreddit, you'll see that teachers don't have enough resources and students can even graduate without learning the skills necessary to actually read and/or write well. Students are frustrated that they're not understanding the work so they take pride in social skills instead because they've been failed by the school system. They see ""book smarts"" as less valuable to the microcosm they're in.

Also, depending on the neighborhood you grow up in, there may not be any role models around that are college-educated. If your family hasn't gone to college, it makes it less likely that you will go to college. If your parents never had time to read to you and instill a value of learning in you, then it's less likely that you will have that. A neighborhood may value street smarts or social skills over everything else. 


Finally, I think that people that come from higher educational backgrounds can talk about things that are not a main concern for people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. For example, at college, I had friends who talked about going to Europe and even Florida for spring break, and I could do literally none of that. My main concern was rent, money for textbooks, work and where my next meal was coming from. Also, they may feel judged or embarrassed for not having high levels of education and feel that these people who aren't like them won't respect them.","lur86mr"

I could've phrased my comment better, but kids can be very bad at understanding consequences. Sometimes a kid will not understand something can burn them until it does. They just won't get that a boiling pot of water is hot, when they've been told, when they've literally seen it boil things, until they get close enough for it to hurt. You can do your best to try to protect them, but sometimes the lessons won't stick no matter what you do. Occasionally you need to make the consequences before something else has worse ones.

I hope I don't have to make this clear but I'm not advocating for hurting kids. Sometimes, though, a kid will only learn through being hurt, so it's best to make that hurt be in an environment that supports them through that, and minimize the pain as best as possible. In rare cases, it might be better to create a situation where they're going to be hurt in a lesser way to save them greater hurt later. Because if you eliminate hurt entirely, they will not be a functional person, and they won't know how to deal with hurt.

Yeah, cool I agree that's not too surprising.  Like if I had my all my money taken away tomorrow, that doesn't suddenly erase the fact I had stable loving family growing up, that taught me valuable skills about health interpersonal relationship, managing money etc and now have a good university level education.  I can go to that job interview I need to get back on my feet, present and speak well and get hired, then be reliable employee etc.  There's a good chance I'd be able to get back to being middle class after losing it all because I have a stable set of middle class skills I can rely on - I know how to be middle class and how to manage that.

But that has nothing to do with someone who grew up with shitty parents on food stamps being semi-malnourished, getting a shitty education in an underfunded school in a shitty community having a much higher chance of staying in that shitty situation does it?  In any one case each individual is free to make their own choices and all have potential ways out of their situation, but statistically people stay in their lane - poor people stay poor, rich people stay rich etc.  So at a person level, it's absolutely on the individual not to fuck themselves up, but if it was 100% only up to the individual then every generation would have massive social shifts as each individual fell/rose to their true place.  But that isn't seen, and most people don't drastically move social/economic situations, so society at large obviously has to play some part in it.  That doesn't mean an individual can't escape their circumstances, loads do, but denying that your initial starting conditions play a part is just absurd.

It's like denying that someone born into the US has better chance of getting rich/famous than someone born in slums of Hati.  Starting conditions matter, so does personal accountability - but one doesn't mean the other isn't relevant.

> I never blamed anyone.

And:

> The kids behaviour explains it

You get to pick only one of the following:

- The kids behaviour explains their families economic situation (the original claims that started this whole mess).  So the reason their families are in that situation is the because of the kids.  It's their behaviour that explain it, therefore their behaviour caused it.  So the kids are to blame.
- The kids behaviour does not EXPLAIN why their families.  Instead the kids behaviour is a likely symptom of their situation, but doesn't explain their families economic situation at all.  So the kids are not to blame.

You can't say ""the kids behaviour explains why they're poor"" but also be like ""but I'm not saying it's the kids behaviour that's the reason"".  If the kids behaviour is not the reason then it doesn't explain it.  

When you use the word ""explains"" that IS the blame, that is the reason for something happening.  Words have meanings.  Look up [explain in the dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/explain) and it literally says ""To explain is to give a reason for doing something"" - so by using the word ""explain"" your giving the reason for something.  ""The behaviour explains it"" literally means ""the behaviour is the reason for it"".  

So while you might not intended to say that it was the kids fault, it's literally what you wrote.  If you meant ""the kids behaviour is caused by their situation"" that's the exact opposite of ""the kids behaviour explains their situation"".  Hence the downvotes for blaming the kids.","luom6vr"

Yes, they have a higher chance of remaining mired in poverty.  But what is the more important factor that dictates a young person's success for future decades: that they are poor or that they have bad attitudes toward public order, industriousness, sobriety from hard drugs, respect for authority?  Conservatives and progressives are perpetually at odds on the latter, with conservatives trying measures like drug enforcement, more policing, and Broken Windows standards to try to change people's behavior.

Did they work well?  No, they did not work well, and there were big problems with excessive incarceration and more.  But there were some satisfactory outcomes.   But what do progressives offer along these lines?  You barely acknowledge that *behavior matters.* Sometimes progressives push for inane policies like this:   2021:   [Baltimore will no longer prosecute drug possession, prostitution, low-level crimes](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/baltimore-will-no-longer-prosecute-drug-possession-prostitution-low-level-n1262209).

>most people don't drastically move social/economic situations, so society at large obviously has to play some part in it. That doesn't mean an individual can't escape their circumstances, loads do, but denying that your initial starting conditions play a part is just absurd.


We don't deny it.  We fully agree than both external conditions (poverty and a disorderly community) and behavior come to play.  Is it 50-50?  Could be, though social science in incapable of measuring these things.  It is progressives who are one-sided.

>Two contending views of what causes poverty—people’s own behavior or their adverse circumstances—will have some validity at least some of the time...(yet)...most of the academic community has coalesced around the view that bad behaviors are a consequence, rather than a cause, of poverty...

>A much more common reaction from scholars...was to suggest that talking about the culture of the underclass was tantamount to “blaming the victim.” Bad behavior and poor choices, in this view, were an understandable adaptation to poverty and the lack of opportunity in people’s lives....scholars continued to define the underclass simply in economic terms.","luv2a3q"

It is not a deliberate thing.  Rather it works like this: They are raised in disorderly communities, with the following common: Frequent public intoxication by various individuals, open air drug dealing, public quarrels and domestics daily, hookers doing tricks in parks, trash all over, groups of unruly youth on street corners, boomboxes at midnight, drivers ignoring red lights and speed limits, and more.

Kids 6 - 11, the critical years where youth form values, see all this disorder and consider it a norm.  They then bring unruly attitudes to school,  threatening and quarreling with other  students and sometimes telling teachers to f--k off.

 Conservatives have tried various law and order initiatives to bring more order to these communities, including Broken Windows policing. Progressives have largely opposed every option.  Unfortunately, now we have progressive outcomes like this: 2021:   [Baltimore will no longer prosecute drug possession, prostitution, low-level crimes](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/baltimore-will-no-longer-prosecute-drug-possession-prostitution-low-level-n1262209).

If you didn't want to actually know the answer you shouldn't have asked.  Because I simply told you the answer.  Other people also told you the answer.  The fact you don't like the answer must be frustrating for you, but at least now you have it.  Even if you don't like it.

I'm sorry you didn't appreciate my help more.","luv4k0f"

The problem is that you believe that ""explanation"" = ""blame"", when that's simply not true.

Nowhere in the definitions of ""explain"" or ""reason"" is blame mentioned. You are misunderstanding what the word means, and then blaming me for misusing it. Ironic.

Reason for something happening has nothing to do with blame.

For example: if I say that ""the reason why the clothes are wet is because of rain"" or ""the rain explains why the clothes are wet"" I am not ""blaming"" the rain (that would be preposterous).

I'm afraid that one of the replies hit the nail on the head:

"luyomxp","shadowrun456","2024-11-02 02:50:15 UTC","I did not ""blame"" or ""fault"" anyone. Your answer of ""explain is the same as blame"" is objectively false.

I am not going to start using different words just because some people misunderstand what they mean -- that would be giving in to the anti-intellectualism. Your replies have only confirmed that the reason for me being downvoted is because people can't understand that explaining something is not the same as blaming someone.

>Also your water example doesn't work because getting wet is neutral. Getting wet is neutral. Hence it's not a bad thing. If however you change the context of your example so it IS a bad thing, then it does become blame

Whether something is a ""bad"" thing is, by definition, completely subjective; therefore, it makes no sense to claim that the same sentence can become ""blame"" or not based on whether the thing it describes is ""bad"" or not. I thought that ""clothes getting wet"" would be universally understood as a bad thing, but apparently not -- it just proves how subjective ""bad"" is.","luv8p6p"

Ahhh ok sooo you didn't blame them.  Lets for arguments sake take that at face value.  So you're now agreeing the ""explains"" means the kids are the reason for the families situation?  Like the poor kids trashing the library made their family poor and the rich kids made their families rich?  

So your line of reasoning is ""the kids caused their families to be poor, but that's not blaming them"".

Ok, fine.  I won't blame them.  But your still wrong - the kids did not cause the families to be poor.  So your original statement is still wrong.  This argument that ""it's not blame"" is a hilarious quibble, but sure whatever.  But your OG post very literally did say the kids caused it.

Since you're not countering that - glad we agree that your original statement was false.  I too agree the kids behaviour does not explain why their parents are poor.
