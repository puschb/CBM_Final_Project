BUT I hate the last ten to fifteen chapters. Everything goes downhill the moment when the King and Duke storyline wraps up and a certain somebody rejoins the cast. The final chapters are amazing precisely because they almost unravel the moral of the original story. One famous writer (Hemingway? Steinbeck?) says that he stops reading the book at this point; i.e. ""the rest is cheating.""",""

But it can be a funny book to read as a progressive.  The author is conservative and his political leanings are mostly subtle in this book.  The first half could be seen as a conservative allegory in some ways, and I appreciate that he does so with such subtilty.  Even the more obvious examples I find beautiful and even very sympathetic.

It's a series of discussions between a white pastor raised with privilege and inherited wealth and a black ex-convict turned non-for-profit founder raised in poverty. While it claims to be an open and honest discussion on the disparity between white and black social mobility and how to begin addressing it as a united front, it honestly just doesn't. Both authors avoid talking about overarching systemic sources of inequality, and even outright cite sources pointing out inequities as somehow misleading. Even the black author seems unaware of the broader social issues that contributed to his upbringing and hardship, or at least he seemed willing to ignore them in favor of only discussion personal choice and Christian ethos as his answer. Overall, for a book stating to want to start a dialog about how to solve a complex problem, it was very reductive and religiously baised as a result of both authors being as myopic as the people the felt they were writing to.

Postman doesn’t think that television is an appropriate form for news because of its instant nature and how quickly it moves on, making the point that new stories are forgotten and can’t be ruminated on. I don’t find this the case, at least in the UK where I’m from stories are given time to be discussed often with multiple interviewees coming back throughout the whole news show section ( a few hours) obviously with 24 hour news stories this is extended.

Postman also makes the case that television cannot be appropriate epistemology, and the written word is much more appropriate. Postman admits that television or visuals can invoke more emotion than the written word and for me that is a part of truth. How we react to things is truth, how I emote is truth and can lead to action which postman denies. Charities obviously use this to effect when asking for donations, in this instance it’s much better to see than to read and is the more appropriate way to invoke action.

I also am aware it’s been a long time since the book was written and can’t speak of how it was in the 80’s and do think television has shaped us to be more entertained. I’d have loved to see what Postman thought of TikTok","lrlr6co"

If, perhaps, this is the only way to achieve the perfect society, then we should ask ourselves a question? Would it be worth it? It certainly is for people in the story not knowing our world. Perhaps all the bad things in the world cannot be completely eradicated without loosing the good things, we need to be acquainted with sadness and despair to feel the happiness, we need hatred in order to be capable of loving.  This was my interpretation but it has been a long time since I have read it so my memory of details is a bit hazy.

Herbert is justifiably praised for how evocative and beautiful these scenes are.

But if you spend time around burnt-out psychonauts for a while, you start to realize that he’s just describing spatial distortion, time dilation, and ego death. I’m NOT telling anyone how to have fun. But some people get so in love with the artificial feeling of mind-expanding enlightenment that they just never ease up. It’s sad, you see them wearing down and losing control of their lives, and they’re just convinced that what they’re doing is some kind of higher calling, NEXT time they’ll finally understand how to change the world or whatever. Seeing those sensations presented as genuinely world-changing breakthroughs just depresses me. It doesn’t make me wonder about the nature of consciousness, it just makes me wonder how I can reach my friends who dive too deep into psychedelics.

Best explanation I can give is how someone who’s known a lot of alcoholics might not like to read Dionysian hymns or texts. It’s not that there’s no artistic value in art exploring how alcohol can allow us to break social chains. But when you’re used to seeing the dark side, you get uncomfortable with art that focuses exclusively on the good.","lrlt4gc"

Frank Herbert disowned his own son because he was gay. He made the bad guy in Dune a very one dimensional bad guy who was bad for the sake of being bad. It was a homophobic choice to make the Baron exhibit the traits he did.

IDK, I am pretty open minded about what people do for fun. But IMO, the way we swoon over Herbert’s genius makes it one of those things psychonauts hold up as evidence that what their doing has deep importance, something that’s worth pursuing to brain melting degrees. I’m not trying to ban it or anything, but I think we need to acknowledge how much of his writing is pretty run-of-the-mill drug talk, not a genius insight into the nature of time and consciousness.

Also his attitude towards sex and women are very. . . dated. The “Destination Void” series in particular tries to make some pretty broad statements about how men relate to women, that the authors present as universal truths rather than the opinions of two horny dudes from the 70’s/80’s.

I read the gospels for the first time right after college (didn't go to church often as a kid) and was absolutely shocked at all of the stuff that I had no idea originated there. Just every other page, I was like ""THAT'S where that comes from!"" I recommend at least the gospels for that alone. 

Wouldn't really recommend starting at the beginning if you're not super into doing that for its own sake. The first book is pretty hard. My kid went through a hardcore religious studies phase and couldn't do it. He was like ""It's all begats. Begat begat begat. I don't care who begat who!"" lol.","lrlwcfd"

"lro0j62","Deleted","2024-10-13 03:09:07 UTC","Yeah, I can see your perspective. There's actually a very interesting article I found on it today. It's called Designing a Brave New World: Eugenics, Politics, and Fiction. In summary, the article argues that a lot of the current perception of Huxley's work is due to a sort of revisionist history of Huxley's life. The author claims, with quite a lot of evidence that Huxley was at least in favor of the following:

- a eugenics program built to enhance human potential. This program, vaguely defined by Huxley's writings would work to conserve the best of humanity. How Huxley wanted to deal with whom he considered inferior was up for debate.

- an authoritarian regime. Towards the late 1920s and early 1930s, Huxley and many other leftwing eugenicists began arguing for a planned society, and a strong executive leadership chosen based on merit -- not democracy. 

Huxley also believed that a society where everyone was equally intelligent, capable, and genetically beautiful was not possible, due to the fact that the hard labor that maintains society requires lesser minds to work at it. In other words, Huxley argued that there needed to be lowere classes to do the sort of menial labor that keeps society afloat. If you've read the book BNW, this seems incredibly familiar to the vision of the antagonist of the novel.

However, the article doesn't conclude that Huxley is in favor of BNW -- Huxley in an interview (I believe) claimed that he was not in favor of BNW, but was not in favor of John's world. A compromise between the two visions must be made -- although in the late 1920s, Huxley surely was leaning towards the eugenics and authoritarian positions of the book. 

You can also see this intellectal wobbling within the novel -- there's no direct condemnation made of BNW's society apart from John's viewpoint. In fact, all the main rebels against the society are people who are atypical. Bernard, Hemholtz, and John. Their arguments against the society only apply to their inability to fit into it -- not some genuine issue with the systems core functionality. However, BNW does allow us to understand how much we'd lose to obtain this sort of utopia. 

In other words, I find BNW to not be an outright condemnation of that world, but rather an exploration of it that laves room for thought. I think it was built this way as a result of Huxley himself still building his values as a young intellectual.","lrmt9eb"

Here you go.

It’s a fable with a message that turns poisonous the more seriously you take it.

Yes we should feel empowered to follow our dreams, but the book implies that if you truly believe and try your hardest all things will work together for you to attain what you want.

If a person actually believes the message and sees someone struggling with disease or financial problems the logical conclusion is that they didn’t want health or prosperity enough. That the Ill the befalls them is somehow their fault because of their own failure.

There’s a branch of evangelical Christianity that had adopted effectively the same message often called the prosperity gospel. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology

This kind of magical thinking is encouraged particularly among people in multilevel marketing schemes, and targets of schemes where the focus is on recruiting other people to further your own goals. A person convinced that success is solely determined by how hard they can believe, who does not take material conditions into account, is already halfway convinced to become someone’s down line in whatever Multi-level marketing scheme they are pitched.

It has the benefit of stopping someone in an MLM from realizing that they have been swindled because they will think their failure is due to their own lack of commitment, not due to them being taken advantage of by a sophisticated scammer.","lrr7ail"

Judging the swarthy, spooky foreigners for their barbaric and unenlightened ways while also being fascinated by them is pretty much a core tenant of the genre. Do you think the Victorians didn't have any social taboos regarding sexuality and continental Europe?

EDIT: ""With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire."" - Van Helsing. The desire in question is to suck out everyone's blood, seduce their women, and generally ruin the whole country. 

I think you can make a pretty decent argument that the book presents the idea that rationalists, Protestants, and Catholics can come together against people who are even more different, which is a viewpoint that makes sense for someone in Stoker's shoes (Irish Catholic in Victorian London, which was a major port for immigration). Gothic horror novels are all about the tension between fear and fascination for dark, Eastern, mystic things that moderate, enlightened humanists know they shouldn't be interested in. Some impactful earlier gothic horror used Catholics from Western European regions like Italy as the source of the ""fascinating, but immoral/irrational/barbaric"" elements of the story. I don't think it's unreasonable that a well-educated Irish Catholic in Victorian London might say, ""Wait, there are people like me who are WAY more integrated into English society than Eastern European immigrants, why not write about traditional enemies teaming up against someone way weirder?""

We can definitely say Stoker's dead, and there's no point in trying to guess what influenced him in his writing choices.

Like, “oh that place was garbage, no wonder she was sickly. Here, in good old Yorkshire, she’s thriving and healthy. Fuck those people and their acrid, hellish landscape.” Read the book. Or maybe you don’t get it because you’re not Indian and you’d rather defend a white author than understand that a native might find it offensive. I have no intention of engaging further on this with you ✌🏽","lrt34rl"

I'm not defending the book or it's author, only pointing out that calling India hot & dry isn't a racist stereotype.  I'm defending the English language, not England itself or English authors.","lrt3rbh"
