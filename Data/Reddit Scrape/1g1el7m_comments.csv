"lrfwwk1","AdmiralAkbar1","2024-10-11 17:24:45 UTC","1. You're correct that the civil war has been massively influential on the South's economy and society. Another angle to examine (which IMO would be more interesting) is to compare and contrast the situation between poor whites like the Ewells and poor blacks like the Robinsons, how they view each other, and how their society views and classifies them.

2. It's important to remember that the book is also autobiographical to an extent; Harper Lee was born and raised in a small Alabama town in the 1930s. It's just as much about shining a light on an overlooked area of society as it is reflecting on her own upbringing and experiences.

3. A key thing to remember is that the state government at the time was unequivocally racist, and that whether de jure or de facto, it treated black people as second class citizens. It would be far more worth examining the difference between what the system promises to do vs. what it does in practice because of the people who run it and their biases.",""
"lrg183p","fragments_shored","2024-10-11 17:48:06 UTC","So I want to caveat all this by saying I'm not an expert in TKAM or in Southern socioeconomic history, but as an American who grew up in that region (and, incidentally, a lit major), it would not be accurate to say that poverty in the South started with the Civil War, although the war was economically devastating. You have to look back much further to the origins of the plantation system and its reliance on slavery for unpaid labor, and then trace that forward, with close attention to the various forms of institutionalized racism that kept emancipated Black Southerners in poverty: from sharecropping and Jim Crow laws to continued voter disenfranchisement today.

Nor do I think it's wholly accurate to call Maycomb a poverty-stricken place. Rather, I think what's notable is how sharply Scout observes the wide range of social classes within the microcosm of her town, from the Black characters whose lives have been shaped by systemic oppression, to the contrast between the ""hard-working""  poor but virtuous white characters like the Cunninghams versus the ""white trash"" Ewells, to working-class and middle/upper-middle class characters (including the Finches). In a classroom setting, there could be interesting comparisons with writers like Austen, and US/UK differences in this kind of social commentary in fiction.",""
"lrg1cib","JonaFerg","2024-10-11 17:48:45 UTC","It’s important to remember that Harper Lee’s father was a lawyer in Alabama, and she was Scout’s age in the same era that the book takes place. The Scottsboro case was happening at that time, where a number of Black men were falsely accused of raping whites women on a train. The trial was closely followed across the state. Combine that with the date of publication (early 1960s, Civil Rights Era) and you can see the motive of her writing. Race is the primary issue in the book, although poverty is deeply imbedded as well. 

Harper Lee’s motive is to have her readers keep fighting for Justice even in the face of difficulties. Atticus tells Scout “Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win,” as a way of telling her the prejudice is strong, but you must keep fighting for what is right.",""
"lrgoxw6","joeallisonwrites","2024-10-11 19:59:08 UTC","Unrelated to your question, but I truly wish that there was a book more relevant to your students. I LOVE To Kill a Mockingbird, but if I were in the UK it seems as though there must be *much* more compelling, localized novels.

> The American Civil War is not widely taught here in the UK and I don't think this is on many teachers' radars, but the fact of Alabama being on the ""losing"" side and the collective memory of the Civil War seem quite relevant to the book.

This is a *tremendous* loss in your ability to teach the book. We are steeped in the civil rights movement and a broad array of things dating back to the founding of the U.S. that are all long-term contributors to the circumstances viewed by Scout.

> I'm really interested in poverty in the book as a social ill alongside racism. Is it fair to say that poverty in the South in the Depression was traceable back to the Civil War and Reconstruction as well as the Depression itself?

Poverty in the south predates all of those issues, and is still frequently (and improperly) attributed along racial lines. (To be fair, poverty is as old as money. You're surely familiar with the notion of feudalism and serfs, so you can draw a comparison there.) There are very old versions of the saying ""land rich, cash poor"". It's a complex discussion, but the picture of the southern plantation was *not* the only picture of farm life - there were plenty of farmers that were absolutely destitute. For many of those people, and more, the Dust Bowl absolutely devastated them. To that end, asking about those top level events is like looking at a dam full of holes and asking if 2 or 3 of the holes are the reason the dam is leaking.

> Is it fair to tell students that in fact Lee is trying to crack open this image and present a three-dimensional view of the time and place?

I think the more fair view is that Lee telling a complex story about deep southern, post-reconstruction life and race relations through the eyes of innocence. I wouldn't particularly call it three-dimensional - most of those around her pass around and through her life.

> From the viewpoint of 1960s America it might have been easy for some readers to dismiss a poor, racism-ridden town in Depression Alabama as beneath their worldview.

The broad opinion from those outside of the south was that southerners were lazy idiots. It was the source of most South-as-a-target jokes. The arguments you might see today about Trump supporters have a lot of similarities with arguments at the time (and earlier) - I'm not sure that most people view a Trump supporter as ""beneath"" them. This may be a linguistics issues, but I wouldn't categorize the views as ""*beneath* their worldview"". More accurately: wrongheaded, mislead, and the product of their environment. If I were to apply the ""beneath"" label, I'd say that farming was generally looked down upon, and much of that attitude does have a direct line to divisions over slavery and the Civil War.

> One of the themes in the book seems to be that the apparatus of government -- education, the courts -- is faulty and does a poor job of people's actual lives. It isn't equal to the social problems on the ground. Is it fair to say this reflects a deeper mistrust between disadvantaged people and the state?

Sounds about right!

I think that one thing that is generally difficult to understand about the premise of the book is the separation from lived experience, an ocean away, and how absolutely normalized terrible things would be if you were a child in that era. Atticus is portrayed as a great, equitable character. From the eyes of the child. Scout would have realistically had an invisible wall between her and anyone that was black, which is a contributor to her innocence. The only true window through that wall is learning that it was safer for a man to appear to be drunkard than be in an interracial relationship. And drunkards weren't viewed kindly.",""
"lrgc83v","e_crabapple","2024-10-11 18:48:07 UTC","A brief historical gloss for non-Americans: prior to the Civil War, the South was an incredibly unequal society, with a few planters (ie, plantation owners) controlling all levers of the economy and government.  Below them were a much larger group of poor whites, and an even large cohort of black slaves.  The planters very intentionally established race laws and racial attitudes to keep those two groups apart, explicitly stating that as long as the poorest white could look down on any black man, they would be content.  The South as a whole was also extremely defensive against the North, and the 1840s and 50s were a time of absolute governmental combat as they fought to preserve and even extend slavery and its associated legal constructs.  This broke out into actual rebellion with the Civil War.

Following the Civil War, there was a 10-year period of Reconstruction, when most of the South was ruled by military governments and explicitly race-blind laws were attempted to be enacted.  Southern resentment toward the North only increased.  Once Reconstruction fell apart due to political maneuvering, and northern control was removed, the South very quickly re-established as many racial laws (""Jim Crow laws"") as they could, short of actually re-establishing slavery.  By the time of WWI, in the name of national unity, the North mostly capitulated to the South's various historical myths (eg, the war was not about slavery but about ""state's rights,"" the war was a great mistake and everything could have been resolved otherwise, black people really were happier as slaves; basically anything contained in *Gone With The Wind*.  Even now, I expect that my summary here is going to be ""controversial"" to some people).  Things on the ground in the South continued as they had since the 1870s.  This is the society seen in the book: incredibly racially divided (by law and by ingrained attitude), economically backward (even by the standards of the overall Depression), and nursing generational historical resentments.  

This was not even begun to be challenged until the 1950s and later; the book was written when the battle to overthrow Jim Crow laws was in full swing in the 1960s, and was topical for that reason.",""
"lrg0jqv","TheCloudForest","2024-10-11 17:44:29 UTC","1. Poor white rural poverty, particularly in the South, is part of parcel of the American experience from colonial times. There's a book called ""White Trash"" that delves deeply into this, but from the time of Benjamin Franklin and even before, there is a ""tradition"" of white free men living in the forests and hills far from civilization and widely seen as borderline animals, with depraved habits and customs from dirt-eating to aversion to employment to sexual licentiousness. The Ewells represent this type.


2. I think it's more a profile in courage (Atticus) and growing-up (Scout) than giving a voice to anyone. The Black characters, and certainly the Ewells, don't have much of a voice and inner life, being both fairly essentialized into tropes.

"lrg0d6a","callistocharon","2024-10-11 17:43:29 UTC","Not a historian or a literary scholar, just a regular USA-ian, but :

1. The American South historically always had extreme wealth inequality. If you were not a plantation owner, you were dirt poor and living hand-to-mouth. West Virginia exists as a state because Virginia joined the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy and the poor people in the mountains who didn't own slaves wanted to join the Union, so they formed their own separate state and did so. Reconstruction meant that a ton of money flowed into the South after the Civil War, there was also a phenomenon of ""carpet baggers"" from the North who traveled to the South with only their clothes and carpet bags in order to seek their fortune.\\*

 The recovery from the Depression also invested heavily in infrastructure in the South. Some places didn't get roads or electricity until the WPA came in and installed it, which, along with the invention of air conditioning in Houston, TX, is what probably lead to the boom in population in the South that we see today.

\\*Probably a bit more in the weeds than you want to get, but a large motivation for the Civil War was that several territories that had attracted people because of the economic opportunities were about to become states, including California, and they would have joined as free states, which would have swung the power in the US Senate in favor of free states instead of slave states, and the slave states really didn't like that.

2. I'm not sure it gives a voice to the voiceless because the POV character is Scout and the protagonist is her father, and Boo Radley feels a little incidental to the whole thing. If you want a book that does that more explicitly, that would probably be Native Son by Richard Wright.

3.  There is a long and storied tradition of mistrust of government and institutions, particularly in the South, but under Jim Crow it was understood that not only was the government bad at its job, it was actively protecting the various apparatus of stochastic terrorism that exists throughout the former Confederate states. But besides that, NASCAR started because bootleggers in the South needed cars with lots of carrying capacity that could outrun the FDA at the boarder and deliver goods to the speakeasies around the country. So yeah, it runs deep.",""
"lrfxvg4","firerosearien","2024-10-11 17:29:57 UTC","1) Economic inequality isn't really a focus of the book IIRC, but for context, the US South was always agrarian until well into the 20th century. It did not industrialize as rapidly as the North did, as huge slave populations performed most of the work. This was actually a huge reason the Confederacy lost the civil war, but it's also important to remember that even before the civil war most southerners were NOT rich - only a few of the very large plantation owners were. This has probably been explored more in depth on /r/askhistorians and I'd recommend searching there.

2) It's hard to argue modern notions of ""giving voice to the voiceless"" when the book is still told from a white PoV. It's a good philosophical discussion - compare TKaM with books written by Black authors - compare, for example Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry, whose author was a descendant of (at least one) slave(s), or Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston

"lrg7q6d","Dear-Ad1618","2024-10-11 18:23:24 UTC","1) Rural poverty predates the civil war. The use of poor people to police slaves (the patrollers) was a tactic used to help establish a sense of white superiority in the poor. The lever was applied with more vigor when poor whites were suddenly thrown into competition with free black labor. 

2) Yes, there was an expression when I was growing up that the only thing worse than a n*****  was poor white trash. Having a human face put in any of these groups was forward thinking at the time.

3) You understate the problem. The state and federal governments were engaged in actively repressing black rights and freedoms and wasn’t much interested in the problems of the poor. This was pre civil rights legislation and before the Great Society reforms of the Johnson administration. The Netflix documentary 13th explains the legislative mechanism for keeping de facto slavery in place.

Apparently she was a self-taught writer who perfected the craft over many years and had no idea the book would become as famous and culturally significant as it became.

I think it’s interesting that all she wanted to do was create a decent piece of writing. I can relate to that immensely. I think for Lee, the social commentary is reflective of her response to small town southern America, where she grew up. That it resonated so well with the readership as a powerful statement on many of the issues you’ve highlighted was somewhat unintentional. Maybe that is the reason Lee felt so uncomfortable discussing her work publicly on the promotional circuit. 

I dont think any of this reduces the value of the book but does give an insight into Lee herself and her intentions when writing. I think it makes the book even more interesting to know that it came to represent so much to readers when those aspects were almost taken for granted by Lee. Maybe because she grew up around characters like Atticus, the views she espoused did not seem particularly noteworthy to her and were more second nature 

Anyway, idk how relevant that would be for your students but I always think about this part of her journey as a writer whenever I hear about TKAM",""
"lrgpq86","elmonoenano","2024-10-11 20:03:33 UTC","I read a lot about US 19th century history. The way civil rights movements and emancipation movements operated at that time is kind of my jam. B/c of that I get pulled into a lot of history going of the US going in both directions, so this response is based on my reading in this area.

1. Poverty was a huge issue in the US at the time of the book, but it dates to at least the Founding, but probably to the establishment of the various colonies. Between the Founding and the US Civil War, the southern economy actually shrank. They went from having a GDP per Capita of about 175% of the north's to a GDP per capita of about 75% of the north's. There's all kinds of statistics about population growth, industrialization, rail miles, telegraph line miles, etc. that shows the southern economy shrinking compared to the northern states. Basically, the political powers in those states were controlled by a wealthy planter class who ruled for their own benefit at the expense of everyone else, regardless of color. So the trend towards poverty in the south basically is centered in its choice to prioritize a slave economy.  But, many choices after the Civil War, including opposition to public education and public works, left the south even more impoverished and it was poor in a way that's really difficult to imagine now. Part of why modern understanding of LBJ's Great Society sees it as a kind of over expansion of the welfare state is b/c it was so successful we can't actually imagine what society was like before that. 
     I would argue that Reconstruction did not play a part in the southern economies backwardness. There is a period after 1876 called Redemption. It's a period of white supremacist backlash to Reconstruction and it's characterized by violence and political repression, by the consolidation of Democratic political power and elite power, and the destruction of more populist institutions. It was an active campaign to burn down schools, lynch teachers, and destroy anything that might improve workers lives. The former Reconstruction armies were pulled out of the south as an occupying force and redirected to anti-labor movements. The best example of this is the violent put down of the Great Railroad Strike in 1877.

2. I would kind of disagree with. It's more of an explanation to White audiences by a White voice that has quite a bit of standing in the culture of what the Southern culture was like. Black people have very little voice, and while I think of Finch as heroic, it is a paternalistic hero. I believe that's necessary b/c at the time and in that place Black people couldn't be admitted to the bar. There was still very limited interest in the lives of Black Americans at the time, almost all of their stories were filtered back through a White lens. Ellison and Wright were both publishing a couple decades before and failed to make the break through. The Black experience just wasn't that interesting to most Americans unless it was a story about music, sports, or maybe a group like the 761st Tank Battalion. But this is a few years before the CRM really pushes its way into popular attention. Things like the Montgomery Bus Boycott had happened, but they were slower and seen as a more local problem. The more evocative protests, like the lunch counter sit ins would start in 1960 as well.

3. I think you have to determine what was the purpose of the institutions and for which people? Were they in place to maintain white supremacy and class distinctions or did they have some other role to play? I would argue that they were very successful b/c their goals since the 1870s had been to maintain white supremacy and counter populist economic reform. You can see the growth in strength in Alabama of the GLP party, a reform party aimed at labor and farmers. They gained victories until about the 1890s and you see Alabama rewrite their constitution in 1901 to basically disenfranchise not just Black men, but also poorer whites. Under that constitution only about 65% of White men could vote and almost all Black men were disenfranchised. 
     I should point out that being registered to vote played other important roles in the society and institutions. If you weren't registered to vote you couldn't sit on a jury. Even now, the improper disqualification of Black Americans from juries is a problem. There's a famous court case called Batson v. Kentucky that while claiming to prevent excluding jurors based on race, basically allowed it so long as you can find some non discriminatory reason, i.e. you can exclude every Black juror b/c you don't like their attitude.

The plantation slavery-based society of the American South had a deep class divide, with the plantations being owned by a  ""Southern Gentry"" class that had its roots in wealthy families that immigrated from England, while poor southern whites were largely descended from people who had immigrated from England as indentured servants during the colonial period, and had largely worked either in subsistance agriculture or as overseers or other hired workers for the plantation owners in the pre-Civil War South.

A lot of the heavily stigmatized aspects of African-American Vernacular English, like using double-negatives, phrases like ""ain't,"" ""fixing to/finna"" actually came directly from the speech of the lower-class whites who first-generation enslaved Africans had the most contact with and generally learned English from.

The book is very grounded in Alabama, so I would suggest focuses on that state rather than branching out to issues like the Tulsa Race Massacre.  The issues there are connected to US racism in general, but have a very different context.  I think you have to explain (and understand) Jim Crow, but I would focus on Alabama.

Beyond the effects of the plantation system, it is important to realize Alabama remained an agrarian state with little industry both pre and post Civil War.  Factories were further north- the textile mills of MA, the auto industry in MI, the general Rust Belt.  I think the distinction between urban manufacturing areas and rural agrarian areas may be more relevant to students in the UK system.

Harper Lee spent most of her adult life in NYC and as someone from the Deep South likely experienced regional bigotry.

And anyone that was seen as an outsider would have been looked down upon or even mistreated. This was made worse in the south due to a perceived class divide, anyone that got a degree(doctor/lawyer) was either from somewhere else; or while they originally lived in the town, they had to leave for college. This also had a racial dynamic in the south, you could be the poorest white person in town, but you were still seen as socially better off than the richest black family. 

1b) This also pivots into the sexism of the era. The main character is looked down on for being a girl that can read better than her level. She is expected to be a meek and pretty face that must keep herself chaste. That is why the white lady had to say that she was raped. She couldn't been seen as wanting sex or having enjoyed it. And the actual victim(the black man), couldn't have said no for fear of reprisal. 

2) You're close enough that the difference is pointless. This is the kind of story that every town in the south like that has, it might not have been common. It might not have ended badly. But at the end of the day, there is a reason that most black families teach their children to be wary of ""the system"". 

3) You can choose to see it as any number of things. Haves and have nots. Whites and blacks. Rich vs poor. There are certain groups that for some reason or no reason are able to have things swung in their direction, and others that have the door closed on them. For example, in the book, the father stays up late at the jail to stand guard against the town lynching his client. The respectable people in the town weren't actually all clansmen. They were putting on an act, using a convenient lie to cover up the ugly truths they didn't want to come out during court. And in the end, they weren't able to go through with it, because a little girl reminded them of their humanity and how disappointed they should be in themselves.

"lrgoa76","IrisMoroc","2024-10-11 19:55:29 UTC","The American south relied upon slavery, which by its nature results in them heavily favoring an agricultural society, as well as social inequality. Since the elites held all the economic power, they would have no interest in moving away from an agrarian society, even though industrialization would have led to economic prosperity for the entire south. Second, the nature of slavery results in vast economic inequality. Slaves are used as labor, but they give back to society very little since they are not paid wages. These wages would be paid to society and thus increase economic demand. 

So you can introduce basic concepts from economic theory - why slavery will produce poverty for everyone not just slaves. Slavery is a very bad economic model.

After the abolition of slavery, the south did a poor job transitioning from an agrarian society to non-agrarian and to this day has lagged behind. A legacy of slavery is that elites could remain in power by upholding the social stratification between blacks and whites through formal and informal means.

It’s never directly confirmed, but we’ve had some great classroom debates about if, knowing that, we can include Mayella as one of the metaphorical “mockingbirds” scattered throughout the book. Just how innocent/guilty was she? how much of her behavior was malicious and how much was sheer survival because of her father’s abuse?

For every ""Rich"" slave owning plantation owner there were hundreds if not thousands of poor sharecroppers barely scraping by.  This was accelerated and exacerbated by the the industrial revolution the North had in that machines were doing the labor in things like textile production so suddenly growing cotton (in the South) paid WAY less than owning a factory that made cloth (In the North where most of the infrastructure was).  This was a LEADING cause of the Civil War as well, but not as big a cause as slavery.  The South wanted to share the profits of the Northern Industrial Base more fairly.  Also keep in mind the Jim Crow laws that were put in place by panicking Politicians to effectively suppress the Black vote in the South extended the poverty (and the racism walking hand in hand with it) for black Americans for decades.  These laws insured it was nearly impossible for Blacks (Freemen OR Freed Slaves) to get a reasonable education and in turn assured them of only having a role in the lowest rungs of society and much lower incomes.  Which made it embarassing for white share-croppers to have to share that lowest rung of society with them as well creating MORE racism and hostility.

2.  Yes, but in a pretty heavy-handed kind of way....which makes the writing more accessible for lower grade levels but kind of super obvious and a bit naive when adults read the novel.

3.  Yes, but it takes a back seat to all of the racism, classism and just plain nasty people who keep the imbalances and injustices in place.  Also keep in mind that one of the VERY real criticisms levered against this novel is that Atticus acts as a ""white savior"" figure, but it's a very necessary role given the times and the rampant classism, racism and poverty.  It would be GREAT to have a black lawyer show up to save the day, but it would not be realistic to the era.

Even so, one of the more touching scenes occurs after the trial, when the black community donates food that was very scarce during the Depression to Atticus Finch as a way of paying him for his legal services and courage in defending a black man.  What the book also displayed for Northern readers was the entrenched racism operating in the Southern states.  

2,  You are right about the book giving a voice to the voiceless.  Lee is presenting a realistic look at the lives of black Americans, something that was not found in American literature prior to the WWII.  A key moral lesson is enunciated by Atticus Finch several times: we must all try to live in the other man's shoes.  This book is all about the importance of empathy, without which racism cannot be overcome.  

3.  You're right on this point too.  The book shows the failure of the legal system to extend human rights to the black population.  It also shows that even members of the system like the judge know that change is going to be necessary.   This was becoming an important national issue at the time the book came out, as seen by the Congress working to pass the Civil Rights Act, and the Eisenhower administration taking military action to put a stop to school segregation.

There are other story lines in this book.  

\\*Scout is coming of age; her older brother to whom she is very close is beginning to distance himself from her.  

\\*Harper Lee's ability to represent Scout as a full-dimensional, believable, and sympathetic person is an extraordinary tour de force for any author and one of the reasons the book continues to be read by young people.

\\*There are eccentric people to be found in small towns.    

\\*Some children grow up with just one parent and can be just fine.  It's the parenting they are given, not the number of parents they have, that matters more.

\\*Atticus Finch is one of greatest examples of moral courage in American literature.  In other books he might come across as too good to be true.  In this book, because Lee is such an effective portraitist, he is as believable as all the other characters, more so because he doesn't try overtly to be or do good.  It is his inner worth that shines brightly, not just his deeds.  It is also his faith that justice will eventually prevail, and that one must keep trying to make this a more equitable world, that is so critical to his personality.

\\*Harper Lee said that the most significant and poignant moment in the book occurs at the end of the trial, when Tom Robinson is found guilty.  The court room is cleared of its audience, except for the black citizens who are sitting in the balcony (they are not allowed to sit with the white people).  They remain as Atticus Finch assembles his papers, and then they all stand as he walks down the aisle and out the courtroom door.  Jem and Scout are sitting among them, and the Rev. Sykes says to Scout, ""Miss Jean Louise, stand up.  Your father's passin.'""",""

Some people unfairly condemn the book for this reason, but that has less to do with the book itself and more to do with how some short-sighted curriculums recommended it as a book to teach black history, rather than, say, Maya Angelou. 

As others have mentioned, class divide in the States is very different from the UK. It’s less about where you went to school and more about your race and what part of the country you live in, so that will inevitably be a topic.

Applicants to register to vote in many southern states were required to pass ""literacy tests"" that were either impossible on their faces, or that tested such obscure information that virtually no black person educated in the segregated schools of the American South could hope to pass them. Voters who had a grandfather who had been registered to vote were exempt from taking these tests, which meant that whites could register to vote freely, but blacks were usually legally excluded.

The US Civil War was direct result of the economy of the South, whose defining feature was slavery which ensured poverty for all non-slavers. Economically, the antebellum South was feudal lords and dirt poor serfs, with the difference being that a large number of the serfs got absolutely no compensation for their labor. 

And all of that revolves around one single thing: population. The South was—and still significantly is—rural. Very low population density. The opposite was true for Northern states, where most immigrants settled. That population density is specifically why slavery didn't last long in those states or some cases never started. With enough people, it is not politically viable to allow the absurdly wealthy to own people to use as a free labor. The poor who have no work available to them because they can't compete with a $0 salary wouldn't stand for it. And they didn't. But in the South there just weren't enough people out of work because of slavery.

As new territory became available, everyone wanted it. The Civil War happened because rich southern slavers wanted to expand their empires where no one gets paid for labor, which was untenable for a rapidly expanding population of Americans. The Northern states *needed* the new states to be free from slavery because they needed a place for people to go, to say nothing of the secondary economic stimulus of having a population of people with money to spend. 

Poverty as a direct result of the local kings siphoning the value produced by labor to their own pockets has been the core economic problem of the US South since the beginning of it. Not to suggest that other places don't have their share, but at least in the US, the South had and continues to have more of it. And the widely accepted culture that supports it is perhaps the most significant economic problem the country faces to this day.",""

"lrfwzky","atomic-knowledge","2024-10-11 17:25:12 UTC","1) I’d argue that the South’s poverty is definitely tracable to the Civil War and the destruction it brought, at least to some extent. Honestly though the South was in an economic predicament even before the Civil War, arguably since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the USA. Antebellum Southern plantation owners (even successful plantation owners) often had to take loans from northerners and were very often in debt. This is basically because the South didn’t develop any sort of decent industrial base (a big reason they lost the war) because they didn’t have a large consumer base (slavery tends to lead to highly concentrated wealth which stymies the development of a large consumer base) to demand manufactured goods. Long story short I think people ignore how dysfunctional the antebellum economy of the south was (usually because they want to glorify that period as some noble age IMO)
2) I’d agree with that assessment generally

Jim Crow laws served to perpetuate racial class disparities following the Civil War, the last of which was not repealed until after the publication of TKAM. 

2. I would question this only insofar as the book filters the voices of its characters through the lens of Scout's perceptions of them. It shines a light on social dynamics that were not always discussed in polite company, but it does so with a critical eye.

Because this book is often taught at the early Secondary level, there is a tendency to assume that its author or - at the very least - its contemporary audience must have related to it in the same way as children do today. For someone with the legal education Lee had in 1960, some level of exposure to Critical Theory probably ought to be a given. 

For example, many Americans are taught to view Atticus as a hero in the story. That's what my English teacher taught me and that's how he's portrayed in film. However, I'm personally of the opinion that this is part of a greater trend in American history to pacify and sanitize radical voices and critiques. Atticus is educated, upper-middle class, influential, and well respected in his community. However, his approach to the central events of the book is to work entirely within the bounds of a system he knows is rigged. He ""prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice"". These words are used 3 years after TKAM is published by MLK to describe the single greatest obstacle to Black Liberation in his letter from Birmingham Jail - the White Moderate.

3. Bob Ewell and his family are an interesting study of this. The Ewells lived in abject poverty. They couldn't maintain access to education, healthcare, or basic necessities. In that sense, the apparatus of government failed them. However, that same apparatus shields Ewell from accountability for his actions and the harm they cause - notably, in this case, harm to a woman and a person of color. The things that you can rely on government for and the things you can't are not wholly independent here. In both cases - withholding aid and shielding from accountability - government serves to maintain a rigid social order.

Bravery is another theme. It’s not the man with the gun (Atticus killing the rabid dog) it’s the old lady beating her drug addiction so she can die “free” and with dignity. 
The mockingbird is a symbol for Tom Robinson and Boo Radley - neither of them do anything but help, and they are “shot” metaphorically. 
That’s why in the end, the sheriff tells Atticus it would be a sin to let the town know Boo was a hero

The scene you will most likely have to explain to your students is the scene when Aunt Alexandra has the ladies to Atticus’ house and they’re talking about how their “help” is getting uppity (that’s a racially charged word, btw) and how Atticus shouldn’t be doing anything for Tom. Alexandra says: Does his food stick on the way down? 
Your kids won’t get that she is calling them hypocrites for taking his hospitality and denigrating him at the same time. 

Dill crying in the courthouse - this scene is what allows Scout to say it out loud: After all, he’s just a negro. This is why a child narrates the story. In her childish way, she can speak the mind of the townspeople, and you don’t hold it against her. That’s the prevailing sentiment and Dill is pointing out that it is flat wrong. Remember, this book was written in the 50s and published in 1960. Civil rights laws hadn’t happened yet. 

To prep your students before reading this book *to them* (I’ll get back to that) study and discuss the Scottsboro Boys first. That will help them get a good foundational understanding of the laws in the 1930s and how accusations were often more than enough. 

Back to reading to your students. They will not understand chapter 1, and it will ruin the book for them. They will need a lot of support throughout, but nothing like what they’ll need to understand that setup. Make sure you understand it yourself before you dive in. Scout describes the people of the town, and makes historical references that will baffle them if you don’t explain them.

After the end of slavery the southern economy was destroyed and suddenly the free labor was gone. The planter class while slightly less well off still had money while the newly emancipated Black population did not and they were largely illiterate and uneducated as required by law.  

This resulted in sharecropping as others have referenced but also Black women working as domestic laborers, partly because they had the skills and white women of the planter class did not and they still had the remains of the previous life to handle.  This would continue for a  /very/ long time and I think that's important to address if you're going to discuss the expectations of women at the time.  Mayella is supposed to care for her siblings, it's implied her father raped her. And she is expected to be chaste and pure, meaning she is seen as a sexual being despite lacking full autonomy.  Calpurnia is a laborer in a white household with a paternalistic man who supposedly views her as ""family"" as though that replaces her own family that she is not with.  Calpurnia and other women like her are the root of the mammy stereotype, sexless creatures happy to labor for white families and care for their children with no lives of their own.  

This is a sticking point of feminist movements in the US as white women fight for the right to work outside the home while Black women have already been doing so for over a century.  They fight for bodily autonomy and sexual liberation while Black women have been oversexualized (Jezebel stereotype) or been completely stripped of sexuality.

You can see many of these caste based issues continuing into modern times, post civil war in the North as well. For example, labor unions didn't admit blacks for example. More recent examples abound, particularly with the massive backlash from poor rural whites after Obama's election. This backlash can be thought of as a reaction to their perceived place in the social order being broken.  Much of the reactionary right in America can be explained by the threat that they feel to their place in the social order.

Poverty has always existed just about everywhere at all times, but I assume you mean whether the disdain and cultural attitudes in the book about poor people can be traced back to the Civil War and Reconstruction. I would, in fact, trace it back even further to the slave-based economy of the South from before the Civil War. The slave-based economy in the South meant that those who could afford slaves to work for them made a lot more money to then afford more slaves, and so on. This created a great stratification in society between wealthy slaveowners and nonwealthy people, and allowed or created a culture where wealthy Southerners thought of themselves as, and took on the trappings of European aristocrats. The film, Django Unchained, with its Calvin Candie trying his best to act like a cultured French aristocrat, is a pretty good representation of this. I would say the same factors that led, in Europe to words like ""villein"" or ""rude"" going from simply meaning a person of a village, or a descriptor for peasant-like to becoming words that connotated immorality and offensiveness, led to the cultural attitude in the American South that poor people were trashy. (of course, this answer is also somewhat simplified - you can trace the southerners' Aristocratic pretensions even further back to European attitudes, and of course there are very many reasons why people disdain the poor).  


2. That the book is meant to give readers a picture of ""a poor, racism-ridden town in Depression Alabama,"" I can see in many of its episodic scenes of Scout's childhood, but not, I believe, in its major message about racism. Organized, political white supremacy in the South (but also, in America in general), even today, exists both in its poor small towns and also in its wealthiest seats of power and privilege. The condemnation of an innocent black man for a crime that everyone knows he did not commit is something that requires a racist lawyer, a racist judge, and a dozen racist jurors.

The main theme of the book is how children grow up and realize that the world isn’t as black and white as you’ve been raised to believe it is. The whole reason it’s called To Kill A Mockingbird is about why you can shoot all the blue jays you want but never kill a mockingbird because their job is to sing sweetly.

Scout has to grow up hearing the kids talk about how Atticus is defending Tom Robinson and is rightly angry at the name calling. But her father gives her solid advice “Crawl into a man’s skin and walk around in it for a while.”

Then, when she and Jem are attacked by Ewell in the climax, who saves them but Boo Radley (who has been portrayed as the neighborhood boogie man), showing that things aren’t always as they appear.",""

Racism was widespread across the country, obviously much worse in the south.  They go back much further than the Civil War but could be traced through the war. 

Poverty during the depression was widespread across the country, not just the south.  Prior to the civil war the south was actually one of the richest regions in the world with per capita income surpassing that of even India. 

There was a disproportionate amount of income inequality prior to the civil war though it wasn’t much worse than the north.  10% of southerners held 75% of the wealth compared to about 68% in the north.

"lrgev42","dxrey65","2024-10-11 19:02:38 UTC","I remember reading a piece back in college about the history of the Southern economies, which talked about the plantation system as being derived as some kind of an idealization of Classical Greek patterns. There was an idea that you could have a patchwork of self-sufficient large plantations (or self-sufficient farming and ranching operations) spreading westward inexorably across the continent, which would be bound only loosely into a republican government. That was supposed to be one of the visions of the founding fathers for the country, which was supposed to lead to an prosperous class of noble land-owners, only minimally under government guidance or control.

That was in opposition to a more democratic vision of the future, which centered more on the development of populous cities. It was also supposed to be behind the Homestead Act, which was an effort to divvy up the western territories in some systematic way. In any case, the whole idea was certainly weakened in the civil war, but it wasn't fully abandoned until the Great Depression, when it was found to simply leave too many people in precarious situations without resources or remedies; the ""family farm"" being so much less stable than larger more industrial farming operations.","lrg183p"
"lrhvd4k","McJohn_WT_Net","2024-10-12 00:23:28 UTC","I agree with this take.  You simply can't read TKAM without being aware that the economic situation alluded to is the Great Depression, not post-Civil War poverty, the antebellum enslavement system (although that too is a topic), not agrarianism vs. industrialism.  The Great Depression was only a generation past when TKAM was published, and readers at the time of publication would have had vivid memories of that period.  The narrative constantly contrasts the struggles of the truly poor and the ""genteel poverty"" of people like Atticus, who is a white-collar professional whose economic constraints are mainly driven by none of his clients having cash with which to pay him.

TKAM is, among other things, a propaganda piece designed to teach white Americans of the early Civil Rights era how to gather the courage to act as allies in increasing freedom for the disenfranchised.  That's the reason Atticus is not only a carefully-structured hero, but also one of the single most deeply admired characters in all of American fiction.  For anyone who saw the conditions the African-American community struggled against, for those who were frustrated at the glacial pace of progress and the easy overturning of every Civil Rights victory, Atticus provided an example of how to do the right thing in the teeth of opposition from family and friends.  The book is less concerned about economics than it is simple matters of justice.

We're starting to lose the key to appreciating TKAM; one the one hand, great, it means we are not longer sunk in the desperation, racist violence, and homicidal resistance to change practiced by the white South during the Civil Rights movement, but on the other, there's a context and richness to the WHY of the novel that later-generation readers miss easily.  The very subtlety that hides the real message was chosen deliberately (by Lee's editors as much as Lee herself) to make the lesson go down smoothly.  Half the novel goes by before Lee introduces the central conflict: the false accusation against Tom Robinson, and his trial and imprisonment, with the central fractures of opinion between the white citizens of Maycomb suddenly apparent.  This pacing is deliberate, as is every moment in the narrative.

Just to address one last point: the support for the Confederacy and the regret for the loss of the Civil War, mentioned in places in the book, are described in a way that makes them seem faintly ridiculous, like an excuse for terrible behavior and general bigotry that no one really believes, but you let Uncle Fred go on about Those People without challenging him just so that Grandma doesn't get embarrassed when she worked so hard on Thanksgiving dinner.  This was a common phenomenon in the era in which TKAM was published.  None of the admirable characters expresses such an opinion, and occasionally, the heroes do challenge bigotry when they hear it.  Go back to the scene where Miss Maudie asks the tea party guest if Atticus's food sticks going down; that's a good example of a subtle, but unmistakable, challenge to prevailing racist opinions, and you can see clearly who wins that extremely polite argument.","lrg183p"

Some of the failure to industrialize was due to losing the war, but a lot of it was an ideological and cultural attachment to the economic system that they had constructed around the institution of slavery.

Race is a much more obvious problem in the US, but I also heard my fair share of really vile racist comments (and witnessed racist violence) while living in the UK. When I inevitably spoke up, I was often told to be quiet because racism was an American issue and they'd abolished slavery before we did (because that just fixed everything, lol).

>The attackers burned and destroyed more than 35 square blocks of the neighborhood—at the time, one of the wealthiest black communities in the United States, colloquially known as ""Black Wall Street.""

>More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals, and as many as 6,000 black residents of Tulsa were interned in large facilities, many of them for several days. The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 36 dead. The 2001 Tulsa Reparations Coalition examination of events identified 39 dead, 26 black and 13 white, based on contemporary autopsy reports, death certificates, and other records. The commission gave several estimates ranging from 75 to 300 dead.

>The massacre began during Memorial Day weekend after 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner, was accused of assaulting Sarah Page, a white 21-year-old elevator operator in the nearby Drexel Building.

>Fewer than one percent of lynch mob participants were ever convicted by local courts and they were seldom prosecuted or brought to trial. By the late 19th century, trial juries in most of the southern United States were all white because African Americans had been disenfranchised, and only registered voters could serve as jurors. Often juries never let the matter go past the inquest.

>Policing in southern slave-holding states had roots in slave patrols, squadrons made up of white volunteers empowered to use vigilante tactics to enforce laws related to slavery. They located and returned enslaved people who had escaped, crushed uprisings led by enslaved people and punished enslaved workers found or believed to have violated plantation rules.

>The first slave patrols arose in South Carolina in the early 1700s. As University of Georgia social work professor Michael A. Robinson has written, by the time John Adams became the second U.S. president, every state that had not yet abolished slavery had them.

>Members of slave patrols could forcefully enter anyone’s home, regardless of their race or ethnicity, based on suspicions that they were sheltering people who had escaped bondage.

>The first police forces were overwhelmingly white, male and more focused on responding to disorder than crime.

>As Eastern Kentucky University criminologist Gary Potter explains, officers were expected to control a “dangerous underclass” that included African Americans, immigrants and the poor. Through the early 20th century, there were few standards for hiring or training officers.

>Police corruption and violence – particularly against vulnerable people – were commonplace during the early 1900s.

>Jim Crow introduced a set of laws that systematically stripped black citizens of their rights while also relegating them to inferior ""separate but equal"" public facilities like schools, washrooms, and sections of the bus (among other indignities). Black citizens were denied access to basic rights, like voting, while also suffering under the weight of racial terror imposed by groups like the KKK and other white supremacists who organized lynchings and other forms of racialized violence.

>Jim Crow laws effectively relegated black subjects to second class citizenship based on a racialized caste system where white citizens were privileged above all others. This system of disenfranchisement was also supported by methods of financial control like sharecropping, which effectively reinstated the financial inequality of slavery through unfair practices.

>And systems like convict leasing guaranteed that black people would be returned to a system almost identical to slavery in everything but name.

>With ""convict leasing"" private businesses could ""rent"" the labor of prisoners to complete tasks. The businesses would pay the state and the prisoners would be forced to perform labor for free.

>As a result, Southern states started incarcerating newly emancipated black citizens at a higher rate, for anything from petty theft to vagrancy or other vaguely defined laws.
This practice lasted from the late 19th c into the early 20th c.

There were two competing visions for rural life and the third more urban vision that were all competing. The plantations fell first, and arguably the other two remain in tension; see all the politicians talking about family farms and giving rural areas more attention then their relative percentage of the population would traditionally indicate, but I get the impression that's a feature of States more broadly.","lrgev42"

The subject matter in TKAM was pinned down by Harper’s publisher. She originally wrote Go Set A Watchman, which deals with similar themes though   Atticus is a racist which surprises her, given the story of TKAM. Her publisher thought the white lawyer defending a black man in court would be a more interesting story and sell better. The ending of GSAW is Scout being physically assaulted by her Uncle, who she listens to when he says that racists are sometimes racist for good reasons, then she apologizes to her father for being angry that he supports segregation, and he says he’s always been proud she stands up for what she believes. 

It’s important to note the white savior trope in TKAM too. 

Really the two books could be used as a great example of why we should elevate black voices talking about their experiences with racism over works from the class of people that oppressed and continues to oppress them. They demonstrate the unconscious bias most white people have towards Black people, and its contribution to the continuation of racism, both intentional and unintentional, in our society.

The Ewells, who are the most immediate villains of the book, are white trash. Since they’re white, they are legally above black people, but it was theoretically possible for black people to situationally position themselves as more respectable. Atticus’ defence strategy for Tom Robinson hinges in great part on this: that the jury should believe an honest, dutiful black man over the trashy Ewells.

Lee landed in New York as an aspiring writer from the Deep South, initially working as an airline ticket agent, hotel clerk, and au pair for an editor.  The family for whom she was nannying gave her a Christmas present of enough money to spend a year writing, and she worked with an editor named Tay Hohoff to shape the initial manuscript, later published as ""Go Set a Watchman"", into something more polished and cohesive.  The stories of Lee's battles with the story and Hohoff are now legend in publishing circles.

At that time, a lot of projects in the publishing world were carefully midwifed under the philosophy of ""It's time,"" and TKAM is a good example.  What we now call a ""white savior narrative"" was, in that era, a call to action from progressive-minded potential allies in the Civil Rights struggle.  You see the trope carefully doled out in movies, TV, novels, and short stories of the time; Sidney Poitier starred in a number of movies aimed to accustom white audiences to the idea of Black heroism, TV personalities as diverse as Betty White, Hugh Hefner, and Rod Serling featured Black performers in roles in which their presence is not remarked on as progressive, and contemporary literature broadened the casting of their characters to include Black faces.  (It didn't hurt that white America was crazy about jazz, and the equation jazz=Black was an easy pitch to the gatekeepers.)

All of this was intended as a combination of the reflection of the opinions of progressive white Americans who could be valuable allies in the Civil Rights struggle, and a roadmap for how to participate in the face of homicidal opposition from segregationists.  The trial that forms the center of TKAM did not appear in the original manuscript, later published on its own as ""Go Set a Watchman""; I don't know that anyone can trace the origins of that particular part of the plot, but it seems likely to have had many parents, between Lee, her editor(s), and her publishers.

There are five Great American Novels in the canon that can be seen as a throughline in the public literary discussion of enslavement society, Reconstruction, the Jim Crow era, the 20th century, and the Civil Rights movement: Stowe's ""Uncle Tom's Cabin""; Twain's ""Huckleberry Finn""; Mitchell's ""Gone With the Wind""; Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird""; and Morrison's ""Beloved"".  The first two are intended to raise the consciousness of white America to the perniciousness of American racism; the third is a regressive, apologetic fantasy for enslavement society; the fourth, TKAM, is a rallying cry for white allies; and the fifth, published only in the 1980s (more than a century after the end of the Civil War that ended enslavement), is the first time American publishers were willing to amplify a Black author speaking directly to a Black audience about the era of enslavement and its tragic effects.  Had Morrison not been as sublime a stylist as she was, and had she not put in her time in the publishing industry long before her own work saw print, we might never have had ""Beloved"" at all.
