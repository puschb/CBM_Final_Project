 ""To find out more about this topic, I contacted my former roommate at Harvard, whose sister works extensively with something vaguely tangential to this topic, to see if she could provide information on it. We agreed to meet at a luxurious resort in Phuket where only the very rich and well-connected can get in. When I arrived after my first-class flight on the world's most prestigious airline, I was dismayed to find that my super expensive designer suitcase had been sent to Paris instead. Fortunately I had my exclusive American Express Gold Diamond Secret Rich People Only card, so I went to the secret department store where only people like Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein are allowed in, and I bought some of the most expensive items to replace what I would need for the trip.

After a refreshing dip in the pool where everyone was staring at my perfectly-developed body, which I keep up with one of the world's most exclusive personal trainers, I had a delicious dinner of the finest Kobe beef with those special vegetables that were imported from Gordon Ramsay's personal garden, I met with my roommate from Harvard's sister, who told me something that I'll tell you about in my next book."".",""

I've also seen this as a common complaint about Moby Dick, having many chapter dedicated to whales and whaling.

Henry James said that a teenage girl, with talent, should be able to write about the army after looking through the window of the Guards mess (elite regiment in London). Obviously he was exaggerating but I think he had a point. I think it depends on the sort of fiction: in some cases the detail is part of the story,  in others its just background. 

I'm an academic historian. There's quite a bit of fiction set in academia, which tends to be accurate *in basis* since the writers usually have experience, although they sometimes work off grudges or create comedy  by introducing things that aren't real but look convincing. I'd probably be irritated by a campus novel that was too far off-beam, or at least it would spoil my enjoyment. 

 But the actual work of history is very seldom represented, and when it is it's often so far from reality it's not even a caricature.  But we don't usually complain because an attempt to represent what historians actually do would be so *boring*.  One of my memories from graduate research is turning over the pages of old newspapers, scanning each one, hour after hour, trying to remain alert so that I'd see a small item on something when and if it appeared. You could pick out interesting things such as key moments from an interview I suppose, but really an interview works because of the whole thing.

The problem of real background is one of the reasons for conventional settings. Science fiction can be useful: i think it was Kingsley Amis who commented that if you want to write about colonialism, you can avoid people complaining that (wherever) isn't like that by going to Mars, where you can do what you like. Ursula LeGuin  does that to some extent.  Earlier,  the Western had a similar use: it wasn't compulsory to make a serious study of the socio-economic basis of settler expansion.",""

Just as an afterthought, this reminds me of reading the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey

  
Stanley Kubrick, who made the movie, commissioned a novelist to write a novelization of the move as it was being filmed.  My opinion is that the book falls very far short of the greatness of the movie, but still manages to solidify a few of the more difficult to grasp details near the end of the story.  

  
The part that is absolutely agonizing however, and somewhat reminiscent of the state of science fiction at that time, the book absolutely bores you to death with descriptions of sci fi gadgets and describing what the look like using the type of language that belongs in an engineering text.  It just goes on and on and on.  So much so, that I really started to feel like I understood why Science Fiction fans got sort of a bad rap in the 40s and 50s.  Like Marty McFly's dad in Back To The Future.  I mean you would have to be some sort of hyper nerd to be getting your jollies from all of these numbers and angles that just dont matter in the context of the greater overall story.  I was so annoyed thinking that the author was just trying to ""wow"" the reader at every opportunity by constantly throwing out how fast something was moving, or how far from earth they were.  

Its as though early science fiction had the habit of going on and on about the premise (fictional science) without using it as a backdrop for a greater overall story.  In this aspect, science fiction has since improved tremendously.",""

They put a facial database in a pair of glasses.  Not, like, they have a pair of HUD glasses with a database.  No, it's its own discrete thing.

That was what I noticed most about the approach to tech in the books, that every time technology is brought up, it is something itself.  It's a bit hard to describe but it feels like a particularly dated approach to tech.  Everything has a single purpose and was built specifically for that.  It's not a computer running software to search for a face, it is the face computer.  They don't track cars because cars have GPS and a cellular connection, it's track to source technology.

The girl was talking about her childhood and how she began playing the cello, her dad found a talented cellist there to teach her and within months she had surpassed his abilities so he had to find an even better cellist to instruct her. She talked about how cello just came so naturally to her and she was so good at it. 

Anyone who’s played any instrument would know how ridiculous the notion of a kid surpassing someone who had studied for years and played at a professional level in just a few months would be. As a teenager who put the hours in to learn piano, I found the whole thing a bit offensive. The crazy part is the book wasn’t even about her playing the cello, it was just one of the many things she had going for her and another example of how great she was.

There's a chapter where a character turns the pages of a magazine and the author describes everything he reads, including an article on nebula. This kind of scenes are very normal in the novel. The two most difficult chapters come early on - one entirely focused on beer business and another about illegal money transfer between mutual banks. That's nearly 50 pages and goddamn it, if you skip these two chapters you'll be lost in the next 1100 pages. There's also dense sections on the culture based on journalist clubs in Japan known as kisha clubs.

But the novel is absolutely great though, might easily be the best crime novel ever written. It's just that the first 200 pages are so scary, readers don't bother with it.

More like many chapters about whales, as well as ships and whaling. 

>it would still serve no purpose in the story as you could just read in Wikipedia 

I disagree. The chapters about whales, ships, whaling, life at sea, etc., are told from the perspective of a 19th century whaler. I would say they also help to build the world of the novel and put the reader in touch with the environment of a New England whaler. They serve to illustrate what was known at the time, which was a lot, compared to the average mainlander who never sailed on a whaling ship. And since most people at the time *Moby-Dick* was published wouldn’t have ready access to encyclopedias or scientific books about whales at their disposal, these chapters also serve to educate the reader. 

>everything is wrong, since it’s from long ago

This simply isn’t true, and even if it were, the information about whales and whaling from the perspective of Ishmael, the narrator of the novel, still serve the very important purpose of building the world of the 19th century whaler. The book isn’t meant to be a scientific source, it’s meant to be a narrative told from the perspective of one of the characters. The errors in knowledge are based on the beliefs, superstitions, and customs of the whalers depicted in the novel. They aren’t supposed to be scientific researchers, nor do they claim to be. Regardless, a lot of the information about whales in the novel is actually correct.","lvw61ci"
"lvw9v8c","arrayofemotions","2024-11-07 13:52:19 UTC","Oh dear. That's pretty far of the mark.

2001 is actually loosely based on a short story by Clarke. Kubrick didn't ""commission"" him at all. The movie and book were supposed to be a collaborative project between the two, with both working on the two simultaneously. To some extent it was. Until Kubrick had scheduling issues and the two started to diverge. The two were supposed to be published alongside each other, but the movie ended up being released first and Kubrick declined being credited for the book, which led to this false idea that the book was a novelization. It's well documented that Clarke wasn't particularly happy with how that all went down, and has implied Kubrick deliberately played down how much Clarke had been involved in the creation of the movie. Considering we know Kubrick could be a bit of a dick, that's very plausible. 

Also... yeah, as one of the ""big three"", Clarke was one of the biggest names in science fiction at the time. Of course the book is stylised in the way all SF was back then. Some of his other books really aren't like that though.","lvvzaf4"

I was super into the musical when I was 10, and have memories of slogging through an abridged version at 10, but I'd been meaning to go through it again as an adult eventually. The manga version kept a bunch of the cut storylines/relationships from the musical, and but still did a decent job reigning in Hugo's excesses.","lvxv8ur"

I'm going to have to give him a pass on using the most obvious historical individuals, given that there is ample precedent for that - **The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles**, **Relic Hunter**, the **Deus Ex** computer game, and every piece of 1990s and 2000s media filled with conspiracies and secret organizations pulled from the exact same bag of tricks - some, admittedly, better than others, though mostly everything was treading the same well-worn ground.

The real problem isn't with the ingredients, but how they are prepared, mixed, and cooked. Most of Brown's preparation was sloppy, his understanding was rather superficial (leading to a few real headache-inducing bits of business), and everything ended up feeling rather underdone *because* *he didn't follow through*, not because his initial choices were bad. On that point there is a whole 'nother discussion, but that's sliding from the point.

Name-checking the most obvious figures isn't ideal, but at least he did some research there - it would have been all the more aggravating had he screwed up that part of his world-building.

It's always been in my mind as akin to historical shorthand - if someone uses Leonardo, then everyone knows at least the basics (if only through film and television), but if you wanted to have, say, Taccola, then there's a whole lot of ground-work to do to get readers up to speed. It's also somewhat easier to get publishers interested if there's something familiar present, whether for good or ill...","lvwjdyc"

"lvxzogz","seeingreality7","2024-11-07 18:57:13 UTC","Stephen King has fallen prey to being an old guy, too, largely due to his dated cultural references. Young characters (often teens or 20 somethings) reference movies, TV shows and music that would have been before their time even if the stories were set in the '90s. Being set in the here and now, they're *very* dated.

Sure, there are young folks who develop an interest in arts and entertainment from their grandparents' or great grandparents' era, but it's uncommon enough so that it would be a notable character trait.

But it's not presented that way. He just throws in the cultural references as if they're perfectly normal for the demographic he's depicting.

But silver chloride or silver bromide papers used for printing are only sensitive to shorter wavelength/higher energy photons. So while you will have to process negative film in absolute darkness, you can use dim red light for photographic paper.Older or more specialized film might not be sensitive to red light, but those are very special cases.

And just consider the fact that you can perfectly well take pictures of red things with modern film - which, by the way was not the case in the early days of photography","lvwfmvj"
