"lt52wb0","Heavy_Direction1547","2024-10-22 08:02:08 UTC","I prefer a chance to solve the mystery but it mustn't be too easy. Agatha Christie was the master at finding that balance and sold a zillion books in dozens of languages accordingly. ""Cheating"" is resorting to the totally illogical or unbelievable for the sake of surprise and a disappointing failure of authorship. The conclusion has to 'make sense' but preferably only with hindsight or there is no mystery.",""

Took me a second to get used to the piecemeal time jump way the story progressed but I think it helped to make the ending more surprising despite all the clues being there throughout the story.

"lt5ddsv","jefrye","2024-10-22 10:02:56 UTC","I'd just like to point out that what is surprising to an experienced mystery reader may be fairly underwhelming for someone new to the genre. For example, several of the books already mentioned in this thread (I won't say which since I don't want to spoil anything) are surprising because they upend genre tropes and/or subvert reader expectations.....but a new reader won't have that background and so is not going to be as shocked.

There are only so many tricks in the world - evil twin! male/female switch! surprise illegitimate child! coded document! unreliable narrator! - and you'll start to anticipate them.

"lt6ao8z","TheUmbrellaMan1","2024-10-22 14:09:49 UTC","Inverse mystery novels have completely fallen out of fashion but I really loved Lady Joker by Kaoru Takamura. Due to the structure we know in the first act who the criminals are and why they are committing the crime and how. The joy of reading Lady Joker was seeing the detective and the journalists piece together the clues left behind by the criminals. Some of the clues were extremely clever. Lady Joker is a great mystery novel to check. It's a 1200 pages of a gripping howcatchem story which is perhaps also one of the greatest crime/mystery novel ever written. It's just that this novel is barely talked about outside of Japan.",""
"lt67i29","SugarAndIceQueen","2024-10-22 13:51:35 UTC","Not much these days tbh, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Readers *should* be able to follow the clues and reach the solution logically in a well-constructed mystery. After a while you become ""trained"" to see that construction so few solutions seem to come out of nowhere anymore when a book is well-written. It's what that veteran reader told you (but I hope they were nice about it) and it's not about intelligence, just experience. Everyone reaches that point after reading enough.

What surprises me nowadays is therefore not the mystery plot itself but when the authors break the rules successfully. As others have noted, *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* by Agatha Christie is the first mystery I read that pulled this off, totally blew my teenage mind. In the last few years, two more that have stood out are *The 7(½) Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle* by Stuart Turton (genre blend, plays with perspective) and *Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone* by Benjamin Stevenson (self-aware narrator, purposefully engages the classic rules of a mystery).",""
"lt53xkc","Liskasoo","2024-10-22 08:14:16 UTC","Peter Swanson is really good for clever twistiness - The Kind Worth Killing is great. The king of the twist is always Harlan Coben - I frequently think I've guessed everything, but then get surprised - but they're more crime thrillers than mystery, and sometimes really violent.

The murder was observed by a group of people and even filmed, but the murderer can’t be found. People saw the murderer enter the victim’s room, but he seemed to vanish when the victim was killed, etc. There is often an element of the occult as well, with hints of the diabolical.

I found *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* in Russian, a language I technically *could* read in, but usually didn't. So, when I got to the end, I *literally* couldn't believe it; I went back and skimmed most of the book again because I thought it was possible I had misunderstood it.

Often one of the pieces are missing, but never with Christie, so it's hard to surpass her. And when you have read enough mysteries one learns to really *read* mysteries and good surprises are rare.

"lt6g551","ImLittleNana","2024-10-22 14:40:01 UTC","This is so true. I try to take long breaks from mysteries but at a certain point we figure out against our wills just from breadth of experience.

I don’t think I’m brilliant, just very skilled at trope recognition. Knowing the easily recognizable guest star in the episodic tv mystery is the murderer doesn’t take a crystal ball, either. Probably why I enjoy new to me old British episodic mysteries. I don’t immediately clock the villain.","lt5jpej"

"lt7yz1d","res30stupid","2024-10-22 19:23:38 UTC","There was a really good game version released last December on all major consoles. Even when set in then-recent 2024, the game takes pains to keep the adaptation as faithful to the original novel as possible. And the twists that occur hit just as hard, even if you read the original book.

Like just who the new character added to the game, Joanna Locke, happens to be. Turns out she exists in the original novel, but her role is so inconsequental that you probably wouldn't think twice about her unless you thought about it. >!She's the cop who found Daisy Armstrong's body after Cassetti killed her and she's the game's second player character.!<","lt4ws9q"

"lt8xnno","SugarAndIceQueen","2024-10-22 22:24:09 UTC","Great encapsulation of the genre essentials. And yes, that's the one flaw with Christie (through no fault of her own): many of us read her books when we're very young, but she's so good that no mystery afterward can quite compare.

Hope you enjoy the Stevenson books! He's clearly an expert in the genre tropes and has a delightful sense of humor to boot.","lt7ozps"
