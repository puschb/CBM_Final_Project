"lxych2g","Difficult-Lock-8123","2024-11-19 17:03:36 UTC","Well, one of my most favourite books of all times is ""The Outlaws"" by Ernst von Salomon.

Naturally this makes him problematic nowadays and some people will look at you with suspicion when you recommend it, but the author was a very interesting and complex person (despite being a nationalist he never was a Nazi and actually helped multiple jews during the Third Reich) and the book is a fantastic and thought provoking window into a different time and the mindsets of young boys (von Salomon was 16 or 17 when he volunteered for his first Freikorps) and men who saw their world crashing around them and decided that they had to fight tooth and nail against that and for a rejuvenation.",""

If you want to read *Sapiens* or *Germs, Guns, and Steel* for entertainment, then go ahead (I've read plenty Harari and Diamond's books for fun, these sort of pop non-fiction books are good palate cleansers); if you're reading to learn, best avoid the generalist theory books and go for something more specific from someone specialised in that specific topic.",""

People act like her books only became popular because of Tik Tok but I was very into BookTube around 2016-2018 and her books were quite popular there as well. 

They weren’t treated as masterpieces but they were considered slightly above average cheesy romance books that sometimes delved into more serious topics and had wild plot twists, almost like soap operas. Most people read them and enjoyed them for what they were, even those with typically more “high brow” taste. They were many readers entry into contemporary romance, similar to someone like Emily Henry today.

I personally think the outrage over her books is overblown, particularly the idea that defenders of them are all crazed superfans who think the books are objectively amazing. Sure, there are some teenagers who are a little too passionate about defending her but I feel like it’s much easier to find videos of people shitting on Colleen or only admitting to reading her books as a guilty pleasure, than it is to find people treating her books like they should be high brow literature. 

Or course there are many issues with her books, namely that she isn’t very good at handling even remotely serious topics or doing anything taboo, and the fact that a lot of her choices are just…. Cringe. I think they’re similar to a lot of books that get popular with young adults - fast paced, accessible, and pretty shallow, with “edgy” decisions made that will make them appealing at first and quickly date them.",""

"lxyudf3","elmonoenano","2024-11-19 18:31:18 UTC","In regards to GGS, I actually like the book and learned a lot, not necessarily from it but b/c of it. But Diamond's work is kind of an example of the gap between popular knowledge and academic knowledge. When he wrote that, b/c he didn't really understand a lot of the topics he was writing about, he was about 30 years behind the curve. Since that book came out more and more evidence has been uncovered or reinterpreted to really bury his ideas. But b/c he was so wrong, books like Resendez's The Other Slavery got recognized by historians with prizes like the Bankroft, which helped update the public on more current scholarship. Now there's a lot of books like the 3 Cornered War and Ostler's Surviving Genocide that are making it to the main stream. There's some backlash against this, but that's kind of the way this stuff goes. But this has been going on within the field of history since at least Gibbon, when his Decline and Fall of Rome immediately sparked a backlash by other people reading Roman history. We've been going through the same thing in the US since the 60s as the Dunning School of American History has been replaced by a rejection of the lost cause myth. 

You kind of need books like GGS to get attention to create a space where people want to talk about a topic and you can introduce the public to better work. Gladwell, at least some of his work, is serving that purpose. His book on strategic bombing helped bring the public's attention to his errors and led them to look at US air strategy more closely when pretty much everyone was turning away from US military policy b/c of the failures of the GWOT.

Right now the author kind of at the early stages of this for me is Timothy Snyder. His historical works are great, but as he wades more into the public sphere, the more his work b/c prescriptive and there's more to object to. Do we really believe Putin and his oligarchs are deeply reading Herman Wirth just b/c he was hanging out with Dugin? That's more speculative on Snyder's part and the deeper he wades into that, the more opportunities there will be for error on Snyder's part. Definitely read Bloodlands, but read The Road to Unfreedom with a skeptical eye.",""

"ly2erux","NekoCatSidhe","2024-11-20 07:31:09 UTC","Do you mean on social media or in real life ? Because I think 90% of the authors mentioned in the comments are still very popular and celebrated by the general public (including Jared Diamond), even if a bunch of dumb social media dwellers who have never touched grass in their life have decided that they were actually ""TEH WORST EVAR !!!!!"" for a bunch of stupid reasons. No one really care what people on social media thinks, except journalists. You should probably read Guns, Germs and Steel and decide for yourself if it is good or not.

I mean, if you even dare to mention Lovecraft here on Reddit, people will come out of the woodwork to scream in your face that he was an evil racist, which may well have been true, but was also true for most people and authors in his time, so is not a thing I really give a shit about. They will also claim that most of his works are racist, which is in my opinion just plain wrong and show that they have not actually read them. 

And that is for an author that I actually agree was racist. If you mention Kipling, the same people will scream that he was a racist and an apologist for colonialism, but I have actually read most of his more famous books and short stories and came to the conclusion that he was actually anti-racist and in fact quite critical of colonialism. To be frank, no one is going to call colonialism the ""White Man's Burden"" and the ""Savage Wars of Peace""  if they see it as something positive, and the fact that people on social media will pretend the opposite just tells me that they have somehow become unable to recognize sarcasm unless it has an ""/s"" at the end. 

But in real life ? Lovecraft and Kipling are still beloved writers that are widely read and no one gives a shit what the social media circlejerk thinks of them or that someone who wrote books a century ago may not have had opinions as ""progressive"" as people on social media do now.

This is quite different from someone like Ferdinand Celine, who was a celebrated author in France before World War II, but who then became a Nazi collaborator and antisemite, and then had to spend his life after the war living under a fake name because otherwise people would have quite literally killed him (his publisher was actually murdered after the war).

Khaled Hosseini, Sally Rooney, RF Kuang, *maybe* Ian McEwan, and I'll risk incurring some blowback here: Aristotle.  And specific books like Middlesex, Life of Pi perhaps, and House of Leaves

She wrote ""The Lovely Bones,"" about a raped and murdered teen who watches over her family and friends from the afterlife, then possesses her friend's body so she can lose her virginity as a ghost. Readers ate it up, and Peter Jackson made a movie of it after King Kong and before the Hobbit films.

Turns out Sebold herself had been assaulted, and she knowingly accused a black man she wasn't sure did it, and had him imprisoned for decades. Sebold pointed out the wrong man in a lineup, and then with police prodding she pointed to the man the police wanted to charge. She willingly was complicit in a highly unethical conviction. Later, she wrote a book about the case, and in her book she made it clear she mis-identified the victim and was uncertain of his guilt -- to such a degree that the financial backer of the book saw the red flags and hired his own investigator, who uncovered the extent of Sebold's and the police's lying.

Sebold recanted 16 years later, and finally the wrongly convicted man (whom Sebold knew all along was wrongly convicted) was released after 21 years of having no freedom. Because he was arrested and convicted based on Sebold's false testimony, and police malfeasance, the state New York settled with the man for $5.5 million. Sebold released an apology letter in which she spoke in passive voice and avoided taking direct responsibility for the man's wrongful conviction, even though she clearly was the one person in a position to exonerate him.

The tldr for people who don't know; during an annual stream for his charity he promised to release a full chapter from book 3 in the coming months. Nothing came and people started asking questions to which he replied ""It's coming, I'm getting it fully voice acted as a special treat."" Still nothing. All we've gotten on news on it was a non-apology that equated to ""oops, shouldn't have promised all that.""

2). The wait and what he's been doing: Yeah the wait is killing some people, but it's what has happened in the meantime that hurts him the most. The longer it takes the more people go "" well he's at x convention, on this podcast, doing this stream, writing other things, producing on a tv show, etc"". Over the 13 years since book 2 the more he does in the meantime without just saying ""yeah I'm not working on it"" just makes it look worse.

3). Book 2 is needlessly long and repetitive. While I came to this conclusion on my own, it's one I've seen many people share.In the time it takes to listen to NotW an AWMF you could listen to the entire LotR trilogy and have 6 hours of your life remaining. A trilogy where people decry Tolkein for focusing on every little detail at times is shorter than 2 books from Rothfuss. Rothfuss's desire to keep this a trilogy is shooting him in the foot. Book 2 had enough breaking points it could have split off into a 3rd book and maybe then we could have gotten more plot progressors other than ""Welp, Kvothe is poor again. Womp womp."" Case in point, remember when Kvothe hung out with pirates for months? No? Probably because Kvothe skipped that part of the story because it was taking too long to tell it. In universe narrator is telling you the story is durdling along as you write it...might wanna split some shit up my dude.","lxyd5nx"

I went to the Native American History museum in DC this year and they had a whole bookshop area with various fiction and non-fiction books written by native Americans and of course there was nothing there by Alexie even though he is one of the most prolific authors. 

And unlike other commenters I do understand what you meant about his own childhood SA experiences: when something happens to you as a child you grow up not understanding that it’s wrong/bad to do that to others. The bad behavior becomes normalized so you’re unaware that it’s problematic until after you get called out for it later in life when it’s too late. So I agree he doesn’t deserve as much hate as he receives. 

I also just want to say in general something my literature professors told us in school was that we should “read and celebrate art for art’s sake” and by art they meant the written arts so like books. So what they tried teaching us is to separate the work from the author entirely. The book can exist on its own without the author now that it’s out there in existence. 

In other words: why should it matter to us if the author went crazy 40yrs after he published a book? We need to learn to separate the piece of art/writing as its own entity in the world, disconnected from its creator. I can understand not wanting to give the author more money/notoriety when they do something bad, but if their work shares an important message for society to learn about (in Alexie’s case, the struggle of Res life for modern day Native Americans) is it really best to completely cancel their work altogether?

It's *at risk* of being taken over by corpate ghouls only interested in monetizing it and using it to prey on the common people financially and gouge them wherever it can, but that side hasn't won. In the book technology is exciting and mostly a source of escape and joy. Ultimately a deeply optimistic view of the internet, which resonated with how most of felt in 2011. 


On the other hand now most people have a pessimistic, even hopeless view of the Internet. It's ruled by billionaires, a source of division, monetized af and scraping us for every last dollar, piece of content or private emotion.

Then it got lifted up higher and higher as a big deal. It was no longer an under-the-radar, underdog, word-of-mouth book. It became a ""celebrated"" book on best-seller lists, canonized as something important.

Then they made it a movie. Spielberg, of all people, signed on. The book was written by a Spielberg fanboy, but now it was becoming a Spielberg movie. Now the big studios and all the big-deal cultural people were suddenly involved in it. All the cynical overdogs -- the ruiners of the pure, the monetizers, the water-downers.

Then the screenplay had the gall to... GASP... \\*make changes to the story\\*! Also, the screenplay had the absolute NERVE to... GASP... make things easier to understand, or fudge plot details for brevity and expedience!

And -- HORROR AMONG HORRORS -- one of the scavenger-hunt/puzzle elements involved driving a car backward when nobody else had done so, and as everybody knows, gamers are obsessive and would have tried that within hours, and therefore the movie is an abomination for not having an iron-clad plot element that could not be torn apart by millions of nerds in their nerdy pile-on of ""we know better than the screenwriters and now we're mad!""

The movie is flawed, and dumb, and changes things, but it's a decent attempt to capture the ideas of the story and have some fun with the concept and entertain people for a couple hours. But how dare it be an imperfect version of an imperfect book? It hurts! The book was written \\*just for us\\* and these people went and \\*exploited\\* it! Waaaaaaa!

So now the book is lowered in people's estimation. Of course, it was always pretty artless and simple. The writer did the best he could with his ideas and worked them over and had fun making a catchy story. But why didn't he think it through more and make it a work of art to stand the test of literary time?

But of course anyone should keep in mind that any real narrative-driven book is inherently going to be very selective of the facts it uses, and alternative explanations are always going to be possible. What Diamond does though is prop up a whole internally consistent perspective that's not difficult to hold in mind. Then it can stand like a framework that other facts and events can be compared to - maybe they fit, maybe they don't. 

Sometimes it's really helpful just to have that framework to *think* from. As long as you're not treating history like a team sport it isn't bad. As human beings, narratives are the main things that stick in our memory, they can be fundamentally useful even if they're incorrect.

They are still great at shaking you out of the traditional western-lens of history and ask your own questions. My personal favorites of Diamond is Collapse.   You just have to check sources and read criticism whenever you’re digesting pop science if you plan to make changes or decisions based on what you’ve heard in the books. Pop science’s popularity shows that people want to learn about science but the way journal articles are written aren’t compatible with casual readers. And that’s ok.

"lxybvox","fasterthanfood","2024-11-19 17:00:37 UTC","I agree, although I think the situation within Hemingway and Kerouac is a bit different. In the case of those fiction writers, it’s that much of society (and in particular people active on Reddit) view the more “problematic” aspects of the authors’ lives and worldviews more critically than people did a few decades ago. That perspective is worth considering, but the books retain the same value IMO (which is to say, a lot for Hemingway, and in the case of Kerouac, maybe a lot for some people even though I didn’t personally appreciate _On the Road_.)

With Gladwell, it’s more that later research has revealed that much of what he claims is true … isn’t. This is very sad to me, since I fondly remember devouring Tipping Point one weekend when I found it at a hotel, and shortly after reading a lot of Gladwell’s magazine work. He remains a great writer, but we now know he’s a sloppy researcher who sometimes presents assumptions as facts. The books’ value is, unfortunately, greatly diminished.","lxy8u0p"

I feel like his writing falls flat, and he often seems like he's more of a hanger-on, even in his fictional narratives, than an actual participant in the story or dialogue.

In my own experience, having lived significant chunks of time out of a car/tent with no permanent home, I feel like Kerouac was dulling down something transcendental for the masses, and he failed to communicate the meaningfulness of the transient lifestyle in a way that actually connected.  

Everything I've read by him reminded me more of a summary than an actual story.  Put another way, after living the experience, his words fall flat to me - but they seem to connect much deeper with people who only ever dreamed of putting aside comfort and security for real adventure.","lxy8u0p"

By the way: it would be completely accurate to say “broken windows was a theory that became popular in law enforcement circles at the time, and was very appealing to readers who were both horrified at violent crime & impatient with outward signs of disorder”. It kind of became popular because the goals were popular. I don’t think any text debunking it at the time would have stopped that momentum. In fact, people still strongly believe in it! However, it is nonsense. In fact, it’s nonsense to say that enforcement alone is a deterrent toward any kind of crime.

She did incorrectly identify the person (last name Blackwater) who got convicted of her rape in the lineup, but she did not just point at the person after the police told her who it was and she did not lie about it during the trial. The incorrect lineup pick was accurately explained at the trial. Sebold, as well as the judge on the case, were told that hair found at scene was matched Blackwater’s. Blackwater was convicted to a maximum sentence by a judge and was released sixteen years later (long after Sebold’s book was released) but this had nothing to do with Sebold. 

Sebold wrote Lucky with the assistance of her case’s prosecutor (meaning all sketchy legal details were explained away by her advisor. The book passed legal vetting. It wasn’t until the book was being adapted into a screenplay that the financier (who also happened to be a well-established con man) hired someone to look into the details. Around the same time, it came out that the state had been using junk science to get DNA hair “matches”. This, along with the incorrect lineup were used to vacate Blackwater’s sentence which allowed his name to get removed from the sex-offender registry and allowed him to sue for wrongful conviction.

However, sometimes Redditors really do know their stuff and give good examples to bolster their viewpoint. That is, when there are topics I actually know something about, often in the Reddit threads there will be people who make strong points that stand up to my own knowledge and experience about the subject, and they're not full of it at all.

That tends to result in a nasty, retributive mindset: ""How dare these little people, who didn't make anything wonderful like I did, criticize anything that I have to say!"" You can really see these machinations at work in J.K. Rowling's case, but you also see it with RIcky Gervais and his recent ""comedy"" routines. I also suspect a little older-age pre-dementia -- a lack of resilience or elasticity to their mindsets and adaptive thought processes.

Normally a person might have some skepticism about over-reaching feminism, or transgender people demanding too many social changes too quickly for one's tastes, or even have some reasonable doubts about policies based on arguments that still deserve more public debate and discussion. Okay, fine. But J.K. Rowling, with her huge bullhorn to the public, and her huge accumulation of public goodwill, has lost all restraint and chosen to make a cultural matter into her main cause because of something stuck in her craw.

Just think -- Rowling could have made nearly anything her main cause. Global warming, for instance -- a real issue, with real consequence for all humanity, and against big powers that are trying to obscure key facts and understanding of greenhouse gases and so on. Instead, Rowling picked an ongoing fight with members of society who are the most likely to face prejudice and abuse.","lxyk4h9"

You had unscrupulous psychotherapists talking patients into believing they had been sexually abused by parents and other family members as kids and repressed the memories. Totally manipulating memories of childhood events of their patients. Needlessly destroyed some families in the process. Some patients filed lawsuits against their therapists.


I remember a website aimed at psychologists and psychology students from the early aughts where they actively encouraged therapists to lie to their patients about child abuse.


One example given was a patient having a childhood memory of their uncle pushing them into the backyard swimming pool and the therapist was encouraged by a superior to redirect the patient into believing the uncle molested them instead because supposedly that was less traumatic than the truth.

It was one of those cases of two disgusting people getting together and living at a time when people were somehow able to pass these ideas off as academic and progressive.

From what I understand the issue with Munro is more that she wrote about the situation with her daughter and used her stories to make excuses for herself. In this case, I think Munro and her daughter were both victims, but Munro is not perceived to be as pure of a victim as she didn't leave the man after she found out and tastelessly wrote about it when her daughter was the primary victim. It's kind of abusive if your mom is publishing her version of the abuse you received from her husband, even if writing was her natural mode. It just doesn't seem like something a good mother would do.

And people usually see the situation as more willful disbelief on Munro's part than truly not knowing something was wrong.

For me, I would never read anything by MZB again. I don't need or want her perspective. But I think it would be okay to read Munro without feeling icky as long as it's not the works about her daughter (I've never read her work, so I don't know what that entails).

Pop science, Pop history, and business books are very popular genres of airport books. One of the hallmarks of the writing style is that the author seems to be belaboring a point repeatedly and then fluffing it out with anecdotes - this is a deliberate stylistic choice because they are writing for folks who are looking to pass time and will be repeatedly interrupted.

Typical complaints

""He's too good at everything!"" - actually he's only slightly better at a lot of stuff than some of his peers. On top of that both older Kvothe and the people around him keep pointing out he's a bit of an idiot.

""Sex magic!"" - The guy walks into a couple situations where people were either already interested in him or ambivalent to sex, and takes that as him being 'awesome at sex'. The fact that increasingly people he has sex with don't have an interest in his techniques should make it clear he's not the God of sex. Also in the same book one of his female friends describes him as a dead fish relationship wise. Someone who no one wants to date because he's emotionally distant and is only slightly better than a night alone on occasion.

""Wish fulfillment!"" - if your wish is to alienate your friends, constantly create more enemies everywhere you go, and generally be a miserable arrogant bastard all the time, then damn you need to aim at least a little higher. The dude pisses off his noble aunt before he can even figure out she's his aunt, just because he can't get over his misplaced pride. 

There's *so much* going on in these books beyond first glance that even if there's never a third book, it should still be studied as a masterclass in layered storytelling. Are there issues with them? Yeah. If anything there's actually too much going on that it detracts from the story on occasion, and Kvothe is given too many outs in many circumstances that he never takes. Also apparently the story really needs to hammer home what old Kvothe is saying in the frame story ""This isn't that kind of story"", because for some reason people still think Kvothe is good at everything and that he's supposed to be good at sex or relationships.","lxyogs8"

Especially when you consider the number of male artists from previous eras whose actions would now be considered awful but at the time were acceptable or at least ignored. I can see the argument against *buying* the work of a current artist in that situation due to not wanting to financially support them, but if you already have some Neil Gaiman books and you love them, there's no reason you can't still love them and re-read them and get what you get out of them.

"lxzemv7","TrwyAdenauer3rd","2024-11-19 20:13:06 UTC","A big part of the book's success was that it came out right around the time 'nerd culture' took over mainstream media, so at the time the fact it was a novel that was dedicated to celebrating 80's geek culture but was also a major mainstream media release and not, say, a series of internet forum posts was a fun novelty. As geek nostalgia reached the over-saturation point the novel's concept and aesthetic doesn't really stand out anymore and there's less incentive to overlook its weaknesses just to have fun with the concept.

I think another big factor is actually this ""poem"" by the author which I remember being widely (and rightly) bashed around the time opinion flipped and I think contributed a lot to making him a massive joke people actively disliked:

>All the porn I’ve come across

>was targeted at beer-swilling sports bar dwelling alpha-males

>Men who like their women stupid and submissive

>Men who can only get it up

>for monosyllabic cock-hungry nymphos

>with gargantuan breasts and a three word vocabulary

>Adult films are populated with these collagen-injected, liposuctioned women

>Many of whom have resorted to surgery and self-mutilation

>in an attempt to look the way they have been told to look.

>These aren’t real women.

>They’re objects.

>And these movies aren’t erotic.

>They’re pathetic.

>These vacuum-headed fuck bunnies don’t turn me on.

"lxz0wez","Dimpleshenk","2024-11-19 19:03:14 UTC","I was surprised anybody (including the book publishers) expected Cline to come up with more lightniing in a bottle. Even while reading Ready Player One you could tell he was ""shooting his wad"" (there's a classy expression) with that book. I mean, he can't help himself from repeatedly describing things as being colored like ""blue gunmetal."" Then for some reason he repeats the expression about a woman's clitoris being like the little man in a rowboat -- though I suppose that's probably helpful for a lot of the audience of the book, who might not know about the clitoris at all. But it was bizarrely out of place in terms of the rest of the story, as if Cline had a kind of ""what the hell"" approach to everything, because he was definitely kitchen-sinking it with details. 

But you look at the plot and it's just Willy Wonka plus The Da Vinci Code plus Midnight Madness plus National Treasure with a whole lot of War Games, Tron, Running Man, etc. 1980s references thrown in. It worked because he diluted it to everything that had worked in other stories and made it click together. He basically took everything he knew and fine-tuned it for one story pulling all the things he loved together.

"ly1n2zq","FuckHopeSignedMe","2024-11-20 03:41:50 UTC","I think it's more than that. *Ready Player One* was written at a specific time for a specific audience. It's very much the embodiment of that early '10s ""let me name drop everything to show I have an encyclopedic knowledge of nerd culture"" style of nerd. 

That was endearing when the book came out, but less so today. Nowadays it sorta comes off as overly commercial due to how every popular nerd franchise sorta expects people to be like that, while back then it was usually just the people who were really into it who'd go that way. The level of nerdiness the book was trying to capture back then is just seen as entry level nerdiness now basically, and nowadays that level of nerdiness also requires you to be able to critically analyse your favourite franchises and so on.

I don't think it would have mattered if Ernest Cline had have broken away majorly from that style of writing. Even if he went on to write completely different things, *Ready Player One* would have been remembered as his very dated but very successful first novel.","lxyv31c"

I think this book really suffered from the political reality of the 2020’s. Reading a book about how a billionaire makes people in poverty play games all for one person to inherit that wealth just doesn’t hit the same after the last few years.

"ly2ptyx","CrosstheBreeze2002","2024-11-20 09:33:39 UTC","I mean, that's not what anyone thinks the problem is. People who love poetry mostly just ignore Kaur, because there's nothing in there to interest them.

The problem is that Kaur has become synonymous, for some demographics, with the very idea of poetry. This is a pretty big problem, because if you give someone whose only exposure to poetry is Kaur a poem by, say, Wallace Stevens, they're not going to be equipped to understand what they're looking at.

Other than shape and a certain tendency towards the gnomic, Kaur's work has very, very little in common with actual poetry. This is why she's popular, which is a worrying situation in itself. But that popularity creates a feedback loop—if she is held up as the _yardstick by which poetry is judged and understood_ by a lot of young people, then poetry is doomed, because poetry worth reading is a hell of a lot more difficult, recalcitrant, and demanding than Kaur's lazy, lowest-common-denominator verse.

Poetry is something people need to learn to read; one needs to recognise certain patterns and techniques, and develop a means of balancing prosody and syntax (much like learning to hear structure in classical music, for instance). Kaur makes none of these demands, while providing a facile but instant reward. She sets a worrying precedent, because real poetry is not like that, and yet her work has been held up as the equal of living poets like Mark Strand, Jorie Graham, or Alice Oswald.

So the effect of Kaur is not deleterious to those who already appreciate poetry. It is deleterious to young people with an interest in poetry, who gain a false idea of what poetry is and can do, and to the hard-working poets who produce work of complexity and value, who find themselves overshadowed by shallow, half-hearted pronouncements that call themselves poetry.","lxyqdea"

The most basic one is they misunderstood what the Chicago School of Economics is and confused that with the actual University of Chicago School of Economics. The Chicago School is a grouping of similar monetary theories, where as the U of C School of Economics is the university that the people who are mainly responsible for the ideological group came form. The Chicago School is mostly about macro economics and monetary policy. Levitt on the other hand teaches at U of C but his work is in micro economics and individual incentives, which is very different. And I think b/c the hosts misunderstood that, they misunderstood the rest of the book. They also didn't really understand how the concept of Exogneny works in economics. They faulted the work in the book for a whole bunch of exogenous factors, which is something economics is well aware of and always trying to figure out, and which Levitt's work, and the work cited in Freakanomics is trying to point out.

But on the other hand, you know who is *not* writing books for the general audience? Historians and scientists. With the exception of *A Brief History of Time* and a couple others, most scholars seem to consider it beneath them to actually take the time to talk to regular folks about their field of study, instead solely publishing articles and books for a minuscule audience of the 100 people in the world that understand what they do. However they have infinite time to bash Diamond, Taleb, etc. who are at least trying to connect the scholarly world with the society in which it exists.

The effort is flawed but it needs to happen. We can't go around complaining that the average person doesn't know shit about history and science, and then complain when that average person picks the only books they can find at Barnes & Nobles that are about history and science. At the end of the day my frustration lays more on the scientists' side than the general audience.","lxyhg6k"

Of course it's going to be wrong, but people taking big shots are always going to be proven wrong in the years that come. As far as a pop-science history of mankind goes, I think GG&S is pretty solid. If it's the only book you ever read and take all your science and history from it, of course that is a mistake.

I always felt Murakami's droll descriptions were as much a part of the story as anything else, as a way of conveying the protagonists' grounding in reality, despite their often aloofness as people — the fact that they could describe what goes on at the bottom of a well just as easily as the exact steps in which they put away the groceries lends a touch of magical realism to an otherwise surreal world.

This building-up of the (male) protagonist's singular experience as the only one the reader is allowed to understand is most problematic when he writes women because he uses them as just another object to anchor the protagonist in space. In Wind-Up Bird, for example, his wife having gone missing isn't portrayed to be nearly as important as the fact that she is no longer there with him. I don't love his frequent use of sexual themes for this reason, that the women are written in for the sole purpose of propelling the story, but then I'd have to consider which characters, places, words *aren't* written for a purpose, and that's a slippery slope.

Never mind that she was born female and even has a child to whom she gave birth.

"lxypoqn","gearnut","2024-11-19 18:08:24 UTC","It's a lot more well reasoned than many of her critics treatment of her, but her online behaviour on the topic of trans people has been dismissive at times (particularly thinking of her tweet about ""people who menstruate"" being women). She also has expressed very regressive views around autistic people's ability to function autonomously in the past (which is very lightly touched on in the article, but not enough to demonstrate her view of autistic people). Holding a strong view opens you up to criticism, especially if you express it publicly, but she is correct in being aggrieved towards the people who have been aggressive to her.

It's a complex topic with lots of viewpoints, Twitter is not, and never has been an appropriate place to engage in discussion of topics with nuance, attempting to use it as such is about as effective as putting a salmon on the floor and asking it to climb a tree.

She's an intelligent woman and there are pragmatic solutions to the concerns she raises in this article, but providing them will take funding that simply isn't there if we are to avoid trans people falling through the gaps and be made unable to access services. I am a cisgender man, I was violently abused in childhood and when I came to look for support in adulthood I found that there were lots of services for women who had been violently, or sexually, abused, and quite a few for men who had been sexually abused but very few for men who had been violently abused, nothing that I saw was specifically for trans people and very little was for everyone (NAPAC are a blooming godsend in this area). There is gender segregation for a reason, but it would have felt incredibly difficult going through that search as a trans person I would imagine (it was difficult for me without having to contact the ones for women only to be rejected, or potentially getting rejected when you turn up because you had the wrong gender presentation at the time of the abuse, or at the time of the counselling).

Not all areas have such an obvious solution as using the disabled toilet, but readily accessible services and facilities open to both genders and safe for everyone to use in a dignified way would go a long way towards addressing concerns from people on both sides of the discussion. Single sex spaces can keep going and trans people aren't left to fall through the cracks in ineffective systems.

Edit: I accidentally got on my soap box a bit there. It's a persuasive piece of writing, it just leaves me in the position of viewing her as either being careless in her discussion of a difficult topic she knows a fair bit about (disappointing for an intelligent person who claims to care about marginalised communities, especially someone who wrote a whole book series where discrimination on the basis of an innate characteristic was portrayed as being an evil behaviour), disingenuously claiming to care about people she not so secretly hates (there are far more effective and easier/ less risky ways of doing this), or lacking the ambition to live in a society where people don't fall through the cracks (bearing in mind her historical outspoken support for Labour governments this seems unlikely).","lxybg85"

"lxzmfvn","Dimpleshenk","2024-11-19 20:52:11 UTC","She  identified a different guy in the lineup, and knowingly changed her identification in accordance with the police coaching her. From there, she knew full well that his conviction was based on extremely flimsy and unreliable witness testimony -- of a white woman who could not tell two black men apart and was willing to lie in court about her level of certainty after already misidentifying one of them.

I can understand that she was traumatized, but she saw him 5 months later and she demonstrably had a hard time telling different black men apart, so it was wrong to go into court and say she was absolutely sure it was him and let him be convicted. Sounds more like she hoped it was the right guy, or she had a hunch it was., and that's just not enough for justice to be served.

Any amount of reading about witnesses will tell you that there are too many emotional factors involved for their testimony to be the basis for life-altering guilty convictions. After-the-fact, the desire to catch the guilty party can be so strong that a person has a ton of incentive to turn their internal ""maybe"" feelings into ""definitely"" feelings.

(It's a shame that there wasn't DNA evidence that could directly link whoever did it and make witness testimony less relevant, because the best outcome of the case -- other than her never being attacked at all -- would have been for the sure guilty party to be slam-dunk convicted.)","lxzj3qy"
"ly8d8zr","Dimpleshenk","2024-11-21 10:36:23 UTC","Shame on you for ""shaming"" without explanation. I read the books, have followed the case for years, and have scrutinized dozens of articles about this subject. Sebold herself has admitted she blew it, so what is your disagreement? You're using your ""authority"" as working with abuse victims, but you can't be bothered to give any sort of reasons for your disagreement? Screw that. Guess what, I work on crime cases and have seen all sorts of case law about these matters up close, and I take what people say on the stand under oath very seriously. Apparently you don't.

And yes, I am well aware of exactly how traumatizing and reality-warping an experience like Sebold's is. It changes people from the inside in ways that can't be put into words. It also does not negate the reality of her actions afterward, and the trauma that the falsely accused and convicted man also suffered. That's the point. I am sorry you don't care about that.","ly7om30"
"ly5soyn","Dimpleshenk","2024-11-20 22:06:12 UTC","As I recall, she doesn't say she was pressured so much that the police reassured her that her false identification was because of X, Y, and Z tactics done by the defense -- but those ""tactics"" were not actually done by the defense, it was just a way to convince her to change her identification. She made the 2nd identification willingly after that, but more important, she confirmed it as an ID that had ""no doubt"" while under oath, when it absolutely mattered, and when no amount of prosecutorial nudging should be able to get an adult with a conscience to willingly lie. From what I've read, Sebold's parents were unsupportive, she had no real friends, and besides her writing professors (who had encouraged her to seek revenge in some way), the prosecution team in effect were the only people who she was remotely close to -- and she felt like one of them, trying to prove herself worthy of them. 

The wrong guy in the lineup was not told to stare her down, and he had no idea of her location behind a one-way mirror. 

The New Yorker article (referenced elsewhere in this thread) and several other articles describe what happened more fully. The man she identified had a beard and then she ID'd a man without a beard, so they didn't even look much alike -- other than being black men she couldn't tell apart (which is a major issue with crimes done by other ethnicities -- a fact that was not yet well-known in 1981.

  
Sebold's prosecuting lawyer absolutely does bear responsibility for much of this, not just Sebold, and it's noteworthy that the lawyer has been unwilling to comment on the case all along. She knows she was unethical and got a false conviction. It does appear to be a case of prosecution wanting a ""win"" so badly they were willing to push ethical boundaries well past the breaking point. What's more curious is that the defense did not try harder to follow up after they learned about what was in Sebold's book. It took an outsider -- a film producer -- to actually make anything happen. 

Sebold has admitted to her own missteps and has expressed what seems to be real remorse. I don't think she should be ""demonized"" as in the prompt, but it reflects very much on what is in her books.","ly3w0h2"

I find that a significant element of Reddit does not care about being careful with their opinions. They are not researched. They do not qualify their opinions with caveats or nuance. Their views are blunt force trauma. It does not mean they are entirely wrong, or always wrong, but they do fling their sensibilities around expecting consensus and when that’s met with resistance it rarely results in further development of a concept or idea, but deeper rationalizing that they are right and others are wrong. 

It’s not that I don’t think that happens in real life to a degree as well, but on Reddit there’s insulation and a real lack of proximity to those we’re interacting with, so the behavior doesn’t reflect that of someone willing to truly understand what the other person is saying. Comments are merely abstracted away from any connection to the human articulating them. This is why when I see observations or criticism I keep my distance, because the origin of these ideas are not grown as organically or distributed in good faith as would be required for optimal conversation around a topic.

She completely mischaracterizes the French doctrine of the time (I say this as the person who, with the help of DeepL Pro, translated and published it into English), suggesting that a famous sentence ""The French Army, returning to its traditions, accepts no law other than the offensive"" appeared as the very first instruction.  It didn't - it was actually part of an appendix discussing the importance of not making suicidal attacks by failing to concentrate your forces first.

But, perhaps Tuchman didn't have access to that document.  We can give her that.  We can NOT give her such a pass on her mischaracterization of the Schlieffen Plan, for which *the book in which it was first published* appears in her bibliography.  It wasn't a master plan - at best it was an operational principle of avoiding the French border forts by going through Belgium.  And, it is very clear that the Schlieffen *memo* (because that's what it was) is not a master plan with timetables, but a discussion of what would be involved in taking down France in a single front war.  Tuchman knew this, she had read the thing, and she still mischaracterized it.

I agree about GWTW, especially when you remember Scarlett was 16 - yes, old enough to be married, but actually quite immature. The war starts and her whole life turns upside down. I'm possibly giving Margaret Mitchell far too much credit, but I see Scarlett's romanticism of things as being due to that. So why wouldn't Mammie love Scarlett and stay with her? She was Scarlett's nurse, they loved each other etc - Scarlett has no critical thinking skills yet. Most of her views come from her parents and community, same as with most teenagers nowadays. 

Later, she is almost constantly in survival mode and she becomes ruthless, for example when she hires prisoners to do labour and believes - like Melanie and others - that the KKK are good people. She only starts to think properly when she realises Ashley is not the man of her dreams and Rhett is. 


Anyway, I haven't read it for a while! I'm also not from the US. I do know Mitchell was a racist, but I think I read those views as being Scarlett's - still very wrong, but with some lenience due to the fictional character's circumstances. Can't do the same with the author though.","lxyhyqe"

The woman making the accusation herself is poor and clearly under her own pressures in a family and area where male rage is omnipresent.

I think the woman in the  \\*movie\\* of TKaM has shades of misogyny in the way she's depicted (just seems like a jerk liar with no conscience at all), and I think a lot of people who read the book and see the movie tend to blur them together because the movie does a pretty good job adapting the main elements of the story.

That's difficult because good debunking often requires a lot of domain expertise, and few people are experts more than a small number of fields. 

One can't just call in experts either. Experts may reasonably disagree with each other, but it's too easy for someone who is new to the field or [has an agenda](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1fdzijz/comment/lmlwdz2/) to excessively cherry-pick the existing literature.

> Munro went back to Fremlin and stayed with him until he died in 2013, Skinner wrote. Munro allegedly said “that she had been ‘told too late,’ she loved him too much, and that our misogynistic culture was to blame if I expected her to deny her own needs, sacrifice for her children, and make up for the failings of men. She was adamant that whatever had happened was between me and my stepfather. It had nothing to do with her,"" Skinner wrote in her essay.

"ly1tgrz","bettewick","2024-11-20 04:25:50 UTC","Many decades ago, I fell in love with The Mists of Avalon. At the time, I was an avid reader with a particular love for stories about King Arthur and had read everything from T.H. White to Steinbeck. MZB's perspective on the tale and the characters thrilled the feminist in me. I read it several times, When I saw another book of hers on the shelf at a thrift store, I was excited to see what else she'd written. I don't remember the title; it was a book about a family of trapeze performers and their life in the circus. As I read on, I was horrified to watch as the older male members of the family were grooming the boys into believing their molestations were acts of love and rights of passage. It was shocking and hugely disappointing. Since then, I've learned the truth about her, and I grieve for my naivete when I adored her story. 
This is much like the way my daughter's generation is dealing with their disappointment in J.K. Rowling.","lxyv13v"

Case in point: early in the episode, they try to claim that the 2010 increase in mental health incidents was due to the passage of Obamacare and increased access to mental health care. The problem with that argument is that the book’s author, Haidt, also shows similar increases in Canada, the UK, and other countries that have universal healthcare and better mental healthcare than the US. The passage of Obamacare in the US doesn’t explain a rise in anxiety and mental health incidents in other countries, but the podcasters didn’t address that at all and just continued on as if they had made some profound discovery that debunked the book. It didn’t. At all. I actually came away from that episode with an increased respect for the book and even more convinced that Haidt was correct.","lxylpm6"
"lxzm58w","Sweet_Reindeer_1911","2024-11-19 20:50:42 UTC","I found their criticism to be particulary unconvincing compared to the vast amount of data and research presented in the book. For example, they try to hand wave rising depression and anxiety rates as attributed to an increase in Obamacare and general awareness, which would be a cute explanation, if actual suicides hadn't risen sharply over the period studied in the book. Then the hosts short of shrug off the rise in suicides by claiming they were higher in the 80s, which is just factually incorrect. They try to claim that the data of rising rates doesn't align with the rise of smartphone usage, but the book doesn't suggest that smartphones are a primary cause, it suggests that social media usage (compounded by smartphone usage) is the correlation, and that aligns exactly. 

Ultimately, I think a podcast is a poor way to rebut a book, because the hosts can claim anything they want without having to cite legitimate and easy to verify sources.","lxylpm6"

Not every 90s wrestler had a Lex Luger physique for another, despite most of them taking them. And I'm sorry, but your take on baseball just isn't accurate, coming from the players themselves.

>Trying to quantify the percentage of 1990s baseball players who used steroids is a fool's errand.

>Los Angeles Times sportswriter Bob Nightengale wrote an article about steroids in 1995 in which Padres GM Randy Smith estimated that 10 to 20 percent of players were using steroids. An unnamed American League GM told Nightengale, ""I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s closer to 30 percent, although most people will say it’s about 5 percent to 10 percent. We had one team in our league a few years ago that the entire lineup may have been on it.""

>Pitcher Jack Armstrong guessed that 20 to 30 percent of players were juicing heavily during his career, which lasted from 1988 to 1994.

>The late, great Tony Gwynn has estimated 20 percent.

>Jose Canseco, hyping a book that would come out years later, told Jim Rome in May 2002 that 85 percent of players were using. It was quickly brushed aside. Eighty-five?

>Ken Caminiti, in bravely coming forward to discuss his own use of steroids to Sports Illustrated the same month, was vilified for guessing that half of players were juicing. In that article, Chad Curtis estimated that 40 to 50 percent of players were using.

>The following year, 2003, 7 percent of MLB players failed drug tests — a number that doesn’t take into account players who took undetectable steroids such as hGH, or those who cycled off steroids ahead of their test, or those who started using again after getting tested.

>If 7 percent is too low a number, and 85 percent is too high, then the actual number has to be somewhere in between those two extremes, no? The number directly in the middle between 7 and 85 is ... 46. Which is in line with Caminiti's rough estimate.

>There's no way of knowing the true number. But Ken had some context and insight into players' use of PEDs. Which is why I think his guess hit the hardest across the league.


[The full article](https://www.dangoodstuff.com/p/youre-thinking-about-steroids-in) is worth reading as well, it goes a lot more into the nearly 150 year history of PEDs than just anabolic steroids.. It's been a long time since the article came out but I remember the Ken Caminiti one being great read.","ly0ircx"

And I’ll concede that, especially in historical non-fiction, there’s always an element of difference of interpretation that academics discuss *through* publications.

But they rarely become bestsellers, and part of the problem is that general audiences prefer reading ""smart"" books that offer easy answers to big questions, rather than more accurate books whose answer is ""well, it's complicated"", because unfortunately reality is incredibly complex and nuanced.

I understand the draw of books like GGS and Sapiens; they're great at making you feel smart, and everyone loves to feel smart. Hell I was fully taken in by Freakonomics myself when I was younger.

Which basically boils down to the fact that I've learned 10x more history playing video games, and 100x more history listening to fun podcasts as an adult than I ever did across two decades of schooling. And the reason is simple.

Those games and podcasts tell interesting stories, whereas every history class I ever took consisted of memorizing a few hundred names, dates, and places with zero time given to exploring what the events at hand actually felt like for the people living through them.

If the goal of learning history is to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, which is more important? Knowing the exact dates and locations in which a mistake occurred, or learning *why* it occurred and what motivations drove the people involved?

Sure, those games and podcasts may not get all of the details 100% right. But they're infinitely more memorable because they humanize the subject matter.","lxyws3y"

The simple takeaway here is that you can't dumb some things down, at a certain point you reach a stage where you've simplified to the point of falsehood. The problem is that the average reader doesn't bother with the research, not that the average historian has made it inaccessible.

Like David Foster Wallace being an asshole, it's easy to tell. The stalking thing should be something worth canceling him but he's dead.

Now about Infinite Jest in particular. The point of the book is pretty easy to get. It's an ad nauseum display of how Irony is dead and we killed it. The world is falling apart because everyone lives in bubbles built on sarcastic and ironic detachment. The main characters abundant talents are wasted on banal self serving, self pity. They don't see how they can affect the world which they live at all, I stead reclined to making intellectualization s of why it wouldn't matter if they did. The book is a thorough use of post modern tropes within post-modeen tropes to make the point post mode n thought is reductive, attractive and inescapable.

To say the book wasn't precient of the current condition is laughable. To say it didn't have a place may have been more understandable in the day that article was written.

The ""k-word"" comes up at least once. That was one of Hemingway's first novels and you can tell much of it is just his journal entries translated into a ""fictional"" narrative, and the Jewish character is based on a real person he knew. There is casual antisemitism throughout the book, which is from 1925. A lot of authors of that time period had similar traits (and Hemingway was also antisemitic in his personal letters), and the one thing you can say in ""defense"" of it is that it paints a picture of exactly how much the foundation was set for the Holocaust of WWII. The main possible defense of Hemingway I can think of is that in spite of the antisemitic commentary and dismissiveness, he still was depicting an ongoing friendship with a Jewish person, so it's more like they had forged a relationship in spite of differences and prejudices, rather than outright shunning and being unwilling to interact or travel/party together.

Louis Cha (Jin Yong)’s Condor trilogy is usually called the Chinese Lord of the Rings, synthesizing ancient tropes and mythemes into a modern format. For both Condor and Water Margin (not Huang’s Water Outlaws) fan translations are considered the best. I collect multiple translations of Western classics, (Iliad, Hunchback) and like to give a heads up.

And yeah, while some authors will act in bad faith to get material released, many good ones get lumped in with them when their writing becomes outdated, and you have people that are ""witch hunting"" the bad writers and taking the good ones along with them for ""lying"" in their older work. they weren't lying, they were just writing when certain information was more available than the current understanding.

An interesting thought on this is the miasma theory of disease. Back before germ theory the idea of myasma was ""bad air"" and that disease was caused by it, so if people got sick they could move out to the country where there was no industrial pollution. To some degree they were not technically wrong! An understanding of that theory led to a widespread set of anti-pollution controls being set in industrialized nations, even though it competed directly with germ theory. But even during the late 19th century/early 20th century you had books published on both theories as serious scientific literature.

Our understanding of biology and biochemistry is changing so rapidly, and theoretical physics are coming up with so many alternative interpretations these days that you're bound to get these sort of problems regularly.","ly4w5zy"

>I was bummed to realize how easy it is to get roped into thinking podcasters are truly unbiased experts 😂

I'm not familiar with other areas, but in the last decade or so, a lot of tech journalism has increasingly focused on video over text. My concern with video/podcasts isn't so much the lack of depth, but because non-technical factors become more important. Video and audio tend to favor hosts who are good-looking, charismatic, humorous/snarky, and in general good presenters. Although these qualities are not bad, they are less visible in a text review where the author's name is often a single line. Also, the reader can analyze and judge the text more easily when the words are literally right there to be picked apart. 

The end result is, to oversimplify it, that I view video/audio as a combination of personality and accuracy, [where a high score in one can counteract a low score in the other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox), while text lives or dies based on its accuracy. 

It's hard to blame video creators and podcasters since a snappy video has a broader audience than a lengthy technical report. But the double-whammy of the halo effect and Berkson's paradox means that when I run across a podcast or video essay, I'm more skeptical of its contents than I would be with written material.","lxz8379"

I think the overlooked factor of most mega successful fantasy and scifi franchises is how they make a world outside of just 'the war', essentially telling many genres of stories at once. It seems to usually be presumed that you slap a romance onto another genre (action and romance, comedy and romance, scifi and romance, etc), and that's enough, but in truth that's just one thing you can combine. Star Wars has so much in it - underworld crime, politics in the age of fascism, farming and essentially slave labour, comedy, romance, a bit of mysticism, etc. When you try to focus on just one, it doesn't work and is too flat.

"ly8dpf6","CrosstheBreeze2002","2024-11-21 10:41:08 UTC","As someone who researches and teaches poetry, I'm very aware that there are different types of poetry, and that poetry is fluid. But poetry _is_ distinct from prose, and that distinction does not lie in the subjects it covers, or in its ability to 'speak to human experience,' something of which prose is perfectly capable.

This view of poetry as a kind of unmediated expression of 'human experience'—or, to borrow some revealing terms from your other comment, 'unvarnished' and 'authentic,' the latter term typically designating, in the context of art, a work without that which the user would consider artifice, or mediation between thought and expression—is an essentially Romantic construction, adopted in the 19th century. It's rooted in a basic distinction between poetry as transcendent of its medium—as in, the idea that poetry is somehow more immediate—and prose as worked and workmanlike. And it is not a universal ideal for poetry, precisely because absolutely no poetry can live up to it.

Ultimately, though poetry _does_ express 'human experience,' as does prose, poetry is equally marked by the presence of _craft_. Poetry is a craft, as much as the weaving of a tapestry or the making of a fine table. And, much as in fine carpentry, what marks poetic craft is the creation of  structures which bear more weight than they ought to—structures in which words do more than they can in prose.

And how is this done? Through _form_. What this means in practice is that, far from the form of poetry—its technique, its craft—disappearing, becoming transparent so as not to impede the unvarnished expression of content ('human experience'), form in poetry exists in dialogue with content, expanding the possibilities of the words which make up that content.

So while I agree with you that 'best' and 'worst' are not useful terms for poetry, there absolutely does exist a metric by which we can question what a poem is doing, and how effectively it is doing it. If poetry is to be the expression of 'human experience,' or of specific human experiences, then we can compare such expressions: let's look at the Kaur poem already quoted in this comment thread.

>i will never have&#10;  
>this version of me again&#10;  
>let me slow down&#10;  
>and be with her

So the 'human experience' discussed here is quite clearly mutability, the way we are bound to change through time, and the momentary grief this can engender. The only formal decisions which interact with the content are the line spacing and the lack of punctuation: the effect of this is that the poem reads quickly, lacking any regular meter, punctuation, or visual spacing that might slow us, which we could understand as making material the poem's emphasis on evanescence and change. It's not an effect I find particularly effective though—the poem makes an invocation (to whom?), suggesting its own recitation as a means of instituting such a slowing down, such a brief halting of change. And yet it presents itself as fleeting. Unless Kaur is rather cynically puncturing her own earnestness—and having read a good amount of her work, I find that singularly hard to believe—this tension seems quite unproductive. It exists, sure, and it does something. But on the level of craft, which is where the expression of poetry resides, it is unimpressive, and hardly expands the possibilities of the words she employs.

This is not to say it needs to be more complicated. Simple poems can have extraordinarily powerful effects. But this occurs when the simple expands itself, using simple means to produce multivalent effects.

I'll end on a comparison to Wallace Stevens, because another commenter mentioned him further up in the thread. This won't be a fair fight, but it really ought to demonstrate that a poem that uses no more advanced vocabulary can, through formal means such as imagery and meter, both better control meaning, and produce more meanings: can produce a verse that thinks for itself, rather than acting as a more-or-less transparent expression of a thought, as in Kaur. Here's an excerpt from 'The Auroras of Autumn,' a long poem reflecting on the same mutability as Kaur:


>It is a theatre floating through the clouds,&#10;  
>Itself a cloud, although of misted rock&#10;  
>And mountains running like water, wave on wave,


>Through waves of light. It is of cloud transformed&#10;  
>To cloud transformed again, idly, the way&#10;  
>A season changes color to no end,


>Except the lavishing of itself in change,&#10;  
>As light changes yellow into gold and gold&#10;  
>To its opal elements and fire's delight,


>Splashed wide-wise because it likes magnificence&#10;  
>And the solemn pleasures of magnificent space&#10;  
>The cloud drifts idly through half-thought-of forms.


The 'it' here is the aurora borealis, Stevens' image for flickering change. Note the variation in pace, as compared to Kaur: the enjambment from lines two to three leads us from cloud to rock to water in a single breath, making this leap of imagery—from the evanescent to the solid and back again—the work of a fleeting moment. This is the same effect as in Kaur, but controlled, and contrasted to the following sentence (lines 4 to 6). That sentence is static, speaking of change 'to no end,' and it indeed 'idles,' that little parenthesised subclause slowing us like a little speedbump before we continue into lavishly long clauses of repetition and assonance (light, delight), which let us linger in the pleasures of these singular moments as they appear and before they go. There is, however, a hitch: Stevens punctuates idiosyncratically at the end of line 7, placing a comma where, grammatically, one ought to place a semicolon. This means that when one reaches the last line, it doesn't parse right—to parse it, we need to return to lines 7 and 8 and understand the 'as' differently, making all those lingering delights we just looked over into not moments enjoyed for themselves, but as temporal context (dependent clauses) for the final line. They thus become moments we linger in, but this lingering is no longer celebrated but made to hamper and impede the poem's progress: here a tension is produced, as in Kaur's poem, but it is not a simple either-or tension, or a cynical undercutting; rather, the poem bathes in the moment, excercising its grief at mutability, but simultaneously understands this grief as a nostalgia, a kind of regression. It can do both; the tension does not undo or undercut as in Kaur, whose tension is either cynical or a misfire, but holds a dialogue, a suspense, letting language _do more_, rather than doing and being undone.

That is poetic craft: poetry is expression, but that expression is always work. Kaur does not put in the work, and so what her poetry can express is always hamstrung. I love poetry because it is fluid, but I don't see that fluidity in Kaur. Fluidity is not a product of craft disappearing or being absent; it is a product of craft working hard to _produce_ fluidity of meaning, to produce the stunning multivalence of Stevens' masterpiece. I'm very sorry, but I absolutely cannot hold what Kaur is doing as equal to what Stevens does, or to what any number of living poets—craftspeople—do.","ly7kq3j"

In my eyes, his characterization of women is more reflective of the traditionalist, patriarchal values that Japanese culture still clings to, and in that way I'd say he has more in common with writers like Yukio Mishima (though probably not *quite* so vociferously misogynistic), whose work cannot be disputed as classic.","lxz7fe9"

My problem at least was that the books (at least babel) were very identitarian in naturem and written in a condescending tone. The book explains to you how if you're priviledged you're bad, no exceptions; if you're oppressed you're good, no exceptions. There's no character rethinking their views, no evolution, no convincing others; the only character that is afforded some grayness is so due to being both white priviledged and an oppressed woman, and being white wins making her evil.

You're talking about ""sex vs gender in law"", well, I'd say yes, but human law or nature law ? Let me develop a bit.

When I say nature, I mean without the human philosophical thinking touch. Even without a human thinking or acting. Because nature doesn't care about human, the law of phycis will apply with or without us, same for all scientific sciences.

I mean what we could call 'the genetic law' would be a law within 'someone who gives birth must be a woman by definition' applies.

The human law, our laws, on the contrary, are much more complex and the human mind and body interact with each other etc. The genetic law is not wrong, but not right either if it goes out of its scope.

JKR stands firm and I don't know why. I don't really know where it's at now and don't really want to. I just hope the heat will drop.

The company takes the whole inclusion thing seriously and while there is still stuff to work on, most people seem to feel fairly safe and able to contribute. I feel pretty secure there despite my autism/ ADHD so I feel comfortable supporting other areas where I have some knowledge and we get support the other way too as people don't feel like they're drowning. I think a lot of marginalised individuals feel like they are drowning and wind up lashing out when they see effort being spent on helping someone other than them, even where the other person is being lifted up by the same amount as them (I have certainly had flirtations with similar thought patterns before, but generally rejected them as counter productive).

Generally marginalised communities will do better if they work together and ask for more rather than fighting over what they're given.","lxyw88i"

"ly172a3","Avilola","2024-11-20 02:03:45 UTC","The JKR situation is such a bizarre one in my opinion. I didn’t disagree with her, at least initially. She basically was of the mindset that we should fight for trans people because they deserve respect and human rights, but that we can’t sacrifice women along the way by dehumanizing them or putting their rights on the back burner. That very reasonable opinion was met with such vitriol that she’s taken a turn, and has started to become increasingly nasty and more extreme. 

I think that’s why I somewhat agree with the person above who stated that the left is also responsible for radicalization. It’s as if people on the left decided that her very liberal opinion wasn’t liberal enough, and chose to demonize her for it. That demonization caused her not only to dig in her heels more, but started pushing her further to the right and into the gender critical pipeline. 

I’m not saying that she’s faultless here, I’m just saying maybe things would have gone differently if her reasonable opinion was met with reasonable responses and criticism. Instead she was met with hate, and became hateful in return.","lxz57uh"
"ly1tl50","Dimpleshenk","2024-11-20 04:26:42 UTC","I read the New Yorker article and it does not negate my points. Sebold was under oath and she said the following during her testimony:

\\----  
“Is there any doubt in your mind, Miss Sebold, that the person that you saw on Marshall Street is the same person who attacked you on May 8th in Thornden Park?” the trial prosecutor, William Mastine Jr., asked, according to the transcript.

“No doubt whatsoever,” Sebold testified.  
\\----

No doubt whatsoever -- after mis-identifying him during a lineup? That would be plenty of doubt. She had already been given ample basis for doubt. I am assuming she was an intelligent enough person to be able to grapple with the meaning of the word ""doubt"" and how it was established to the extent that the idea of ""no doubt whatsoever"" would become false.

The New Yorker article underscores that her poetry and writing teachers had suggested she use her writing to focus on revenge. Sebold admits as much -- that her writing prompt and fixation on healing through retribution (and through associated writing) clouded all of her judgment. 

The New Yorker article also makes it clear that Sebold's own account of the way the prosecutor handled her during the lineup is something that she, and others, could have easily identified as the basis for a miscarriage of justice.

The only question at this point is whether to demonize her or sympathize with her, and I choose to sympathize with her to the extent that she asked for and deserved none of what happened that set all of this in motion. Nor, apparently, did the man she accused. It is also very clear that Sebold has suffered both the crime and the guilt of everything that happened when she ended up falsely accusing somebody of committing that crime, and that if her remorse is not genuine then there is no observable difference between true and false remorse. So I will refrain from further condemnation of her.

That said, all of what has happened casts a very different light on her books.","ly0h4vt"
"ly5s0jq","Dimpleshenk","2024-11-20 21:57:37 UTC","I did not say she set out to wrongly convict someone, but after making an identification based on a misunderstanding alone (because she thought the man was talking to her when he was talking to a police officer), and then mis-identifying that person in a lineup, she had all sorts of reason to not then go up on the stand and claim she had ""no doubt"" that the person in court was her attacker.

Even if we grant that she was traumatized and not good at telling black people apart, she then had decades to reflect on what happened, as a college-educated and celebrated author who had heavily researched case law, rape, and all related matters -- and she even wrote in her book a passage about her own case that makes it clear the conviction was flawed. The issue of the conviction was made apparent in multiple stages of the film adaptation development. She was silent throughout.

I think she genuinely was in denial or something, not maliciously putting an innocent man in prison. Nonetheless it reflects very much on her books and how they are received.","ly3saw7"

"ly5l3n8","InternetJettator","2024-11-20 20:16:53 UTC","Again, I fully agree with you, you're absolutely describing a real phenomenon, and truly good science communication will include this caveat.

I'm specifically annoyed with authors like Gladwell, because if he did his research properly while writing his books, he would not come to the conclusions he comes to. 

For example, the ""10,000 Hour Rule"" is based on work done by Anders Ericsson who, at the time of Outliers' publication, said it was a gross oversimplification of his work. If Gladwell asked Ericsson about the thesis he set out in Outliers while researching the book, Ericsson very likely told him he was incorrect, and Gladwell published the book anyway. If Gladwell did not ask Ericsson about the thesis of Outliers, that suggests he's not even doing basic fact-checking and is even more unreliable.

There are a lot of examples of Gladwell specifically doing this sort of thing, and in my opinion they make it really hard to trust any of the theories he proposes. He's a genuinely compelling writer who has a bad habit of telling his audience two interesting facts/stories, then coming to completely spurious conclusions when putting them together. The fact that he writes really well just makes the problem worse, because his unfounded ideas get spread around all the more as interesting small-talk tidbits.

Again, there are plenty of good science communicators who write books about research that turns out to be wrong. The problem with Gladwell and authors like him is that they don't even seem to care. To paraphrase philosopher Harry Frankfurt, the honest person and the liar are both concerned with what is true, but the bullshitter is not.","ly4zzn0"

Bradley wrote a whole literal serious nonfiction essay on the virtues of love between women and girls.  (I removed the link to the essay from this comment because it's hosted on a site that justifies such sexual behaviors.  The title is ""Feminine Equivalents of Greek Love in Modern Fiction"" and you can look it up if you want and you haven't eaten recently.)

Bradley's husband was a *literal card-carrying member of NAMBLA* with multiple convictions for child molestation.  He likewise wrote a whole literal essay on the positive aspects of love between men and boys that I'm not going to link here either.

And when fans tried to get Bradley's husband kicked out of a convention in the '60s the big names in fantasy [gaslit fans and called the accusations character assassination despite *knowing the accusations were true*](https://cloggie.org/wissewords2/2014/06/16/that-breendoggle-much-much-worse-than-you-think/).

Which is all to say: Bradley did not hide her taste for young flesh. She *publicized* it. She *justified* it in the name of feminism and sexual liberation.  Her husband was a literal convicted child molester and *she defended him.* And the big names in fantasy closed ranks and defended them both.

Bradley could have hidden her abuse of her daughter from her friends, but I cannot believe Lackey was unaware of Bradley's beliefs or what she and her husband were doing to teenage fans.

And then there was what Lackey said when the accusations against Bradley became public knowledge.

Nothing.  

And believe me, I looked. I *wanted* her to be on record saying ""I didn't know, I'm horrified, I would have acted if I'd known"" - *something*.

As far as I know Lackey has never spoken publicly about Bradley's abuse of children.

At a time when that kind of content was sugar coated or ignored or actively censored - and there's a nonzero chance we're about to see those times again - Lackey told stories based on real abuse to show her teenage readers there were people out there who knew what they were going through.

I’m not saying you specifically said that you wanted his works canceled, but you took the time to reply to my comment about signs of his cancelation taking place so I assumed you disagreed with my POV of wanting to preserve his works in the literary canon. 

Agreed, we should not want to promote or celebrate any author who has caused or perpetuated any harm to others. I don’t celebrate Alexie as a person or as an author and never suggested anyone should: I celebrate and enjoy his literary works and appreciate what they did for the Native American community. 

I do believe art (books/written works) exists beyond its attachment to its creator and that once the art is “out there” its solely up to the reader to decide what to make of it and the author is completely removed from the equation at that point. I understand not wanting to support an author who has done bad things and hence not wanting to buy their work, but selfishly I’d rather not miss out on a good artistic experience if there is one to be had. And thats the sole reason I read Alexie even though I knew the bad shit he did :/ which i don’t forgive, condone, or celebrate. 

I agree with you there are many other Native American authors (who are not problematic!!) that deserve to be celebrated and whose work should be read just as widely if not more so than Alexie’s. Susan Sontag is an oldie but a goodie for me","ly6wap0"

It's about **form**, about knowing how to craft a book that audiences actually enjoy reading. Just interesting facts are not enough; you need to take these facts, array them into a narrative and use it to lead the reader to a satisfying conclusion. And both that narrative and that conclusion are likely contrived and a little bullshit, because scientific questions are rarely that convenient.

I don't know about you, but learning more about my field of study didn't actually make me feel smarter. Much the opposite: the more I learned, the more I realized how little I actually knew, and every question led to more questions, and many of those questions are still unanswered. To me, that's what learning looks like, just an endless rabbit hole. But if I'm reading a non-fiction book in my free time, I don't want it to leave me even more confused and uncertain than I was at the start. That's the conundrum. 

So I get it, I get why these more confident, less rigorous books are way more popular than those written by more serious academics. But I still resent it, because those books, for me, have something unscientific about them. Science, fundamentally, is just a method; it's all about rigor and controls and checks and verification and countering our frustrating human tendency to think whatever idea popped into our head is correct. It's about keeping our confidence under control and telling us to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves. And books like GGS and Sapiens just don't do enough of that.

Then again, maybe I'm idealizing too much; I've seen plenty of papers sell themselves to high-impact journals by aggrandizing their own conclusions. So, eh, whatever.","ly1mski"

Just because HP is a series about magic British kids going to school in a castle doesn’t mean it isn’t a product of the 90’s. The series is whimsical in a way that is a lot more rare in 2024 than it was when it released, ESPECIALLY for a series aimed partly at teens. Draco’s portrayal is a turn-off for a 2024 reader because he’s presented as pretty popular early on despite being an open wizard supremacist.

Fortunately a wonderful side effect of these books, even if the research is wrong or the author is straight up lying, is that it does bring attention to the material. The unfortunate side effect is that most people will only understand what they've read in the book as opposed to what the actual science says. Because it is typically far more complicated.

Preston, Gladwell, and Crichton have all developed some bizarre controversy, but I don't think that any school of science has anywhere near as much controversy as psychology. And the more I see people write about pop psych, the more skeptical I become.","ly5l3n8"

A lot of individual works are extremely colonialist and racist, but in works like [Gunga Din](https://www.poetryverse.com/rudyard-kipling-poems/gunga-din) you can see Kipling is grappling both with his own views and that of the society he's in. 

Kipling was steeped in and part of the culture of the British Empire, and the British Empire was founded on the idea of white superiority. You can't extract him from that context, and it's a visible theme in his work. However, you can see that he was conflicted about this, and there's significant friction between his/his society's values and those that come through in his work.

I'd distinguish him from someone like Lovecraft, who was hate-filled and bigoted by the standards of his time, and whose fear of anything different to him drips off the page. Kipling, I feel, held the ideals he did because of the context he was in, rather than in spite of them.","lxyxjww"

They don't mean that they want to become interesting so that they have something to offer women, at least not entirely. They want the opportunity to take advantage of women who admire them, and a male-dominated establishment to support them when they do. And for most of human history, that opportunity and support has been provided to successful men.

This attitude is behind basically every abusive male celebrity I've ever been disappointed by.

But the more I think about it, the more I disagree that ""scientific questions are rarely that convenient"" and the more I feel like academia as a whole is just not interested in reaching out. I don't know about you, but when my ""non-scientist"" friends ask me about my research, they *are* interested! And even if I tell them ""hey what I'm telling you is a bit simplified, but that's the general gist"" they're eager to engage. I fundamentally believe that people like to learn if they feel like what they're learning is important or entertaining.

Absolutely, getting education in a topic will make you feel less smart about it. But I'd say that you're still plenty smarter about that topic than someone who hasn't studied it. And if you write something that to you may feel like it's oversimplified, it may still be an accurate and interesting take for someone who doesn't have your background.

You touch on another point that I think is an important one when you say

> Science, fundamentally, is just a method; it's all about rigor and controls and checks and verification and countering our frustrating human tendency to think whatever idea popped into our head is correct. It's about keeping our confidence under control and telling us to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves.

That's absolutely true of the scientific method. However, we make the mistake of thinking that it applies to every facet of ""science"" as a whole, including the scientific community and scientific writing, when in reality these aspects of it are very human and we should accept that they are. You and I both know that there's nothing rigorous about Reviewer #2 asking you to add citations to paper X or Y to your article because it's damn clear that Reviewer #2 wrote these papers and wants to up their h-factor. The choice in teaching a statistics 101 class that ignores edge cases for complex distributions is not a choice of rigor, it's one of convenience and an understanding that you can still transmit valuable information even with simplified concepts. We spend our entire education going from simplified model to slightly-less-simplified model, and yet we deny the same approach to the general audience.

Technically, we all stop at some point down the rabbit hole, and I find it sad that we then refuse to hold people's hands when they're trying to get a few steps into the hole because we just happened to have gone further down.

I do agree that it's not easy to write these kinds of communication, and academia does not prepare people to it, quite the opposite, actually. But my final point is this: if the scientists won't write these books, the scam artists will. The people who believe vaccines are made with mercury and 5G have no qualms about simplifying their message to get it across. If we continue wrapping ourselves in a shroud of ""well it's too complex for you all peons, how can you even discuss vaccination without understanding the difference between RNA and mRNA"" then we are frankly dooming ourselves to be an insignificant raft of precious knowledge soon to be sunk by a tsunami of ignorance. Dr Oz and RFK Jr are about to become main figures of the US healthcare system, and we're out here worrying about whether our papers made it to a journal with a high enough impact factor.","ly1sw4g"

Roombas have existed since the early 2000s. Younger millennials, who did grew up on Harry Potter, also grew up with phones. 

Harry Potter takes *place* in the 90s, but the readers were youngers the characters were supposed to be. It's strange that you think readers can't empathize with characters from a different time period. This is what what the imagination is for. Fantasy and speculative fiction are popular for a reason. And most of Harry Potter takes place in a different realm anyway, so real world technology shouldn't matter. I mean, just a few years ago, Stranger Things were real popular, even among kids, so I don't buy that kids don't like ""old"" stuff. No kids got those 80s references, but they love that show anyway. 

A bigger reason for Harry Potter's decrease in popularity among younger fans (other than JK Rowling being a POS) is probably that it has simply stopped producing new yearly content. The franchise is not the juggernaut that it once was and without that constant shiny new content, younger fans are seeing that the books are not as special as their millennial parents had tried to make them out to be. 

There is also a lot more options for people to choose from nowadays, than there were when the ""Harry Potter generation"" was growing up. Harry Potter didn't have compete with a million different stream services and TikTok videos, in the beginning, not even social media or YouTube. There were books and cable TV and you have a limited selection. There are limitless options today, so it's harder for things a franchise to become as popular as something like Harry Potter did back then.","lxz5s99"

It should never have been sold as just a light fun romp with magical beasts, over the dark Grindelwald war story it is (which, imo did have a potential audience, it was an interesting bit of backstory in Harry Potter, and had the opportunity to be seen as having current political relevance), in the first place. It's perfectly standard for characters in WWII films to have had lives that aren't just revolving around WWII without that confusing the audience. Why *would* Newt be any different? Rather the ordinary life beforehand is used to contrast with the darkness of war, provide something meaningful that can be lost (and, characters can end up using unexpected skills from their civilian life, too). Even Harry Potter does that, really!

Can't say I think 'rise of magic Hitler!' was ever precisely a *good* idea, mind, that was never going to turn out exactly tasteful (currently stuck on the last 40 pages of a Doctor Who NA that sees fit to throw aliens into Nazism, because argh, every bit is so painful!).

Reading poetry is not like reading prose; it requires an understanding of techniques and their effects on meaning. The poem quoted there—it's pretty much just a statement. You could make a vague case for the unpunctuated end-stopped lines marking out a rhythm, or you could count syllables in the lines to understand it's pacing, but ultimately there is so little interplay between form and content that as a poem it teaches essentially nothing of what 'deep' poems (as opposed to Kaur's surface) do.

Kaur's effect, broadly, has been to give people poetry they can understand with no effort, and because she's been held up as the equal of other poets, the same people have come to see this as a yardstick, and to see more complex poetry not as potentially richer, but as an effort they oughtn't need to put in. 
Now, I'm a researcher and not a pedagogue, and so I recognise that I might not have the whole perspective here, but I struggle to see what pedagogical value this kind of poetry can have, unless used as a lesson against taking this facile level of accessibility and (ultimately) emptiness as something all poetry ought to replicate. It just has so little in common with even the work of popular poets like Wendy Cope or Roger McGough that I can't see how it could lead people toward anything more worth reading, unless by negative example.

"ly3wxq0","prefixbond","2024-11-20 15:08:18 UTC","Again, this is all based on a profound misunderstanding of her position and the surrounding context, and taking the least charitible, least understanding view of her position. 

Here is the most charitable view, which is incidentally, more consistent with the character of the person that created the Potterverse. 

Rowling doesn't think that the word ""woman"" refers to an inner feeling or identification, but rather to a biological body. This matters to her, because it has mattered to feminists for many years, until more recent interpretations of feminism, which Rowling (and many other feminists) disagree with. (Again, just a philosophical disagreement, common in movements). This feminism suggests that women are disadvantaged precisely BECAUSE of their bodies (and its sexual and reproductive functions). It is important to understand that a lot rests on this to understand the motivations of JKR and that they are fundamentally UNrelated to ANY attitude towards trans people. 

The poltical left has embraced fully the new understanding of gender identity to the point that it viciously attacks anyone defending the position that Rowling holds. So Rowling supports the statements of anyone, right or left wing, who is willing to publicly defend this position. Since few on the left are willing to, many of those whose statements she supports are on the political right.

Note that: 

1) supporting a particular statement of a person doesn't imply supporting everything that person does. 
2) the people in the list you mention are mostly in a similar position to Rowling (that is, they are known mostly by reputation, rather than what they actually think/say). Some of them are far more harmless than their reputation suggests.
3) Rowling truly dgaf what anyone thinks, so she doesn't spend much time defending herself. Nobody else is willing to either, so she is like a defendant with no defence in the court of public opinion.
4) At this point, most people are more willing to believe anything bad about her, rather than the alternative, that they and many others have been so wrong about her and have mercilessly attacked her for no reason. A bitter pill to swallow.","ly3m7it"

It's fun to examine the things that he chooses to dwell on and the things that are implied, and examine psychologically why he is framing himself in certain scenes the way that he is. 

My problem with the Felurian section is more that it is... boring? The novel has inertia to it at that point, and then suddenly, he's in a timeless void seducing a sex goddess. It feels out of place. It lacks urgency. And then it ends without consequence like waking from a dream.","ly8x3g1"
