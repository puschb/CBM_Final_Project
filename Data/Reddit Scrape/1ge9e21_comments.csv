People seem to enjoy it. On the other hand, I'm looking forward to the new Southern Reach book.

There is at least one sequel with another planned (if not already out) and I plan on not reading either. I feel like sequels are a weakness of hers and I genuinely think adding more from where the first book ends will not improve upon it at all. The other is the newer books from the Red Rising series.

Second was the black jewels series by Anne Bishop; she wrote a trilogy and then maybe 3-4 other books following that, which I read. But then she made some changes and did a time jump where I was no longer interested (trying to avoid spoilers).

In both cases, the last book I read was a perfect place to end the story, and I was not interested in the new direction the author was taking it. No offense to either author, as I'm sure those later books were also well-written, but I didn't feel the need to continue going.",""

"lua0y2e","Rooney_Tuesday","2024-10-29 01:24:36 UTC","IMO opinion that’s a good call, because the second book was so dull I couldn’t even finish it (people seem to be split on this one). Apparently the third one is much better though.","lu853ud"
"lu80z8m","ShawnSpeakman","2024-10-28 19:02:28 UTC","I rec the first HOUSE trilogy by Brian and Kevin. I thought those were well done. They don't possess Frank's lyricism -- who could match that? -- but they were wonderful additions to what came before.

Doing the bullet point thing makes sense though if you don't have any desire to read them. :)","lu7zfln"
"lu856ip","agent_wolfe","2024-10-28 19:23:49 UTC","Yeah, skip Brian & Anderson’s books.

It’s not just that the writing is different, but some of it breaks the universe. You know “that thing” that happens to the God Emperor over thousands of years? Now there’s a clone that’s basically a Transformer that could do it back and forth at will. Everyone’s a clone now. And the villains are just “cliche evil meganomical robot” and “cliche backstabbing robot”.","lu7zfln"

"lu87dlt","DeiseResident","2024-10-28 19:34:49 UTC","That's exactly what i did. Didn't read book 4 until at least 2 or 3 years after it came out. There's actually a 7th and supposedly last book due out next year some time","lu86mws"
"lufaaeb","Exploding_Antelope","2024-10-29 22:11:04 UTC","The final book of the second series will be out in a year or two so it might make sense to be able to read them all together! 

For now just know that in the interim, the solar war rages on and Darrow and gang continue the struggle for freedom of the worlds against the scattered remnants of the Society. You can check in on how they’re going when you’re ready.","lu86mws"

"lu8gmdz","chiterkins","2024-10-28 20:20:44 UTC","I've never been able to get into the Mistborn series, but Terry Brooks' Sword of Shannara series also does shift in tone a little from beginning to end. What I love about that series (and the Valdemar series by Mercedes Lackey, tbh) is that while there are MANY books, most of them are trilogies or quartets, so if you only want to read 3, you can.","lu87kqm"
"lu8m33q","Sansa_Culotte_","2024-10-28 20:47:50 UTC","> I felt that way about Mistborn. I adored the magic system & intense battles, but probably should’ve stopped after the first 3.

I feel the same about Mistborn Book 1.","lu87kqm"

The question was if you think a series ends perfectly which I think Millennium 1 to 3 does, would you want to read any newer entries.","luf1efv"
"lufpify","GlitteringHappily","2024-10-29 23:36:09 UTC","There are some great parts and it’s mostly well written (duh it’s Atwood) but the plot is very book-to-film YA fiction and it’s not faithful to the first at all. I wish I’d let it be","luf1k7z"
"lu89cvw","QueenMabTheRed","2024-10-28 19:44:41 UTC","Can confirm, the ending is just as nebulous and ambiguous","lu85mza"
"lu82l5x","joebear174","2024-10-28 19:10:39 UTC","Mostly I read the synopsis for his books because so many fans are conflicted about whether he took the story in the direction that Frank was aiming. I can sort of see why Brian's mainline Dune books are so divisive; the plot really does seem to go in a wildly different direction than it seemed like Frank was setting up. I guess we'll likely never really know what Frank intended for the ending, but I thought Chapterhouse ended in a way that was very fitting for the themes he had been presenting for 6 books. 

As far as reading the House trilogy, I'm not sure if I'm up for reading more books in that universe, but I did see that they have been or are currently being adapted into graphic novels. I think I'll read the comics as sort of a visually interesting abridged version, rather than reading the full novels. I love the universe of Dune, but I'm craving different media interpretations of it now. I'm looking forward to the tv shows, movies, and games that are coming out in the next few years.","lu80z8m"
"lu89jvq","joebear174","2024-10-28 19:45:38 UTC","Yeah, that's about what I took from reading the synopsis. It felt like he was just bringing back every character that ever lived as clones, and I felt like there's no way that wouldn't be super messy and unsatisfying.","lu856ip"
"luchkg0","joebear174","2024-10-29 13:36:13 UTC","It took me about 4 months to get through them all, but I *cheated* a little bit. I mostly read on my Kindle, and they offer a discount on the audibook through Audible if you bundle it with the text. So I would listen to the book during workouts and cleaning around the house, and then switch to traditional reading when I actually had free time. It was probably a 50/50 split between reading and listening.","lucbmeq"
