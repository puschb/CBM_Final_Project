A friend has loaned a few books to me. She did state that she wanted one back. When I tried to return a second one, she said it was mine to keep, put in my little free library, or pass on to whomever I wanted.

But there are definitely people who see book-gifting as a casual thing and assume you'll hang onto it if you want!

Personally, when I'm given a book without clear instructions, I make a mental note to return it after reading it, even if it takes me forever to get around to it. That way, if I see the person later and they ask, I don‚Äôt have to stumble through an ""Oh, I totally forgot"" moment.

I‚Äôd also add that when someone doesn't follow up, it might mean they didn‚Äôt expect it back or they've forgotten they lent it to you.

There are others that you loan out because you know the book and reader well enough that there will be some mutual enjoyment.  But you don't expect the impact to be quite as profound.  
  
I have a book- or I should say I have *several copies of* a book that has never been returned to me.  Little, Big by John Crowley is a book that I recommend to everyone but ""loan"" only to a select few.  To the people who are capable of reading that book at a deeper level than ""just a nice story,"" returning it is nearly impossible.  One person I gave a copy to told me years later that he had felt guilty for not returning it, but couldn't bring himself to do it.  I wouldn't have given it to him if I hadn't known that he possessed the intellect and literary experience to read it properly.  I'll tell any random stranger to read it- on the off chance that they do as well.  But unless I'm sure, it will remain a recommendation.  
  
Thankfully, I am blessed with people who are able to appreciate that book.  So I always have at least two copies on hand.  One to read and one to give away.  (I actually have three- My first copy is basically falling apart because I've read it so many times, but it has so many notes, highlighted passages, marginalia, etc. that I can't seem to give it the proper burial it deserves.)",""
