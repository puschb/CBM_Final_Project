"lpw9wwy","ApparentlyIronic","2024-10-01 23:46:02 UTC","I'm not an expert by any means, but I always thought a year was the minimum between sequels. One of my favorite authors, Joe Abercrombie, is considered a fast writer (from what I hear) and he ends up writing new books almost every year. 

When writing a series, I think A lot of authors usually have at least a rough idea of where the story is going beforehand, so the writing is faster than if they were making everything up on the fly.

I think 1-3 years is reasonable for most series. Obviously it depends on quality and quantity though. 

Then you have authors like GRRM who has been writing his sequel in the A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) series for over 10 years now. And although more time spent writing usually equates to higher quality, and George is a fantastic writer, I don't think that extra time spent will translate directly to quality.

I don't mind books that come out quickly in a series, but the quality issues are no joke. Last series I was reading that had fast releases often had books with grammatical errors throughout which is always disappointing to see.

I think a decent timeframe is roughly one year, maybe a little less. I strongly appreciate authors who have a really steady release schedule as well. I think Michael J. Sullivan has always been great about organizing his projects and releasing them in a really consistent way.

I hate when authors juggle multiple series, and sporadically publish entries in every series. Like Sara J. Maas. Two series going at the moment I think, and there's a lot of time between entries to each series because she's working on them simultaneously. Just pick a series and finish it.",""

"lpx7lis","DixieDragon777","2024-10-02 03:17:07 UTC","If I love a series, I'll wait however long it takes.

Writing speed varies. Some writers are single, no kids, and writing full time. Others have jobs and write when they can. Some use AI. (Those are often the ones spitting out a book every few months.) Some write every waking moment, while others write when the mood hits them. Some plan and outline, and rewrite over and over. Other just sit down and write by the seat of their pants. We call them pantsers, and the former ones are plotters.

Some very successful authors have writers on staff. The famous author comes up with an idea, outlines a plot, and pays the staff to flesh it out. I could name names, but I won't.

I write. I average 6 months per book, but things happen. Illness, family issues, computer glitches, writer's block. I have a 5 book series and a children's chapter book out. The next book is in my head. I have all the main characters named and a description of each in my notebook, but have been kept busy by several events that I couldn't control.

I'm between a plotter and a pantser. The big picture is planned, but the scenes develop as I write. Sometimes, I get an idea and change a bit of the big picture to accommodate the new twist.

So. be patient. Every author has a writing speed and individual methods. Publishers often give deadlines, but more and more writers are bypassing traditional publishing and going with self-publishing. Indie writers are pushed by the need for money, not by being nagged about deadlines.",""

I loved Jonathan Franzen's book Crossroads but then was immediately bummed because I knew it would take him a mini eternity to come out with the sequel. But at least it'll probably be worth the wait. 

Also, not really what you're asking but I think it's interesting- sometimes it seems like (or possibly it is true that) lit fic authors don't really know there will *be* a sequel until they're moved to write one - I have Candy House by Jennifer Egan, which is supposed to be a follow up to A Visit From the Goon Squad (written more than ten years later). Haven't read it yet, but it's high up on my TBR list. 

Anyway, I just wait as long as it takes; I think having an immediate sequel is a marketing ploy in certain genres. I think making the stories into multi-book series is itself a marketing ploy. I think it started in earnest with Harry Potter. There were a lot of stand-alone YA books before that, and then after a few years, everything was fantasy and 10 books long lol.",""

"lpwa4t8","Gold_Major770","2024-10-01 23:47:23 UTC","It‚Äôs interesting you bring this up because the pace of publishing can really influence our experience. When I was younger, I felt that same impatience with waiting a year between books. But as you grow older, there‚Äôs a deeper appreciation for the time it takes to craft a quality story. Sometimes an author needs that breathing space to develop characters and enrich the plot. 

Balance is key here. On one hand, quick releases can keep the excitement alive and the story fresh in your mind, but there‚Äôs a risk of the narrative feeling rushed or incomplete. Conversely, a longer wait can build anticipation and ensure the book is polished, but it might test the limits of patience, especially in our fast-paced world.

For me, a sweet spot is about 6 to 9 months. It‚Äôs enough time for authors to refine their ideas without feeling pressured, but short enough to maintain reader engagement. However, the quality of the series really determines my willingness to wait. If the world and characters are compelling, I‚Äôm willing to stick around for however long it takes.

 Erikson and Esslemont made the passage of time easier with Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach and the start of the Esslemont series. It took 8 years before I finally read CG. And another 12 before I finished Assail.

But their proclamation of completion at least lets me know that major plot points have been dealt with.  Anything beyond that is written to please the fans (or to milk a few extra bucks out of a popular series) which is fine by me.

  
With that aside, even if I were to wait for the next book in a series I don't think I would want to wait more than 6 months.  I read 25-30 books a year.  I would be hard pressed to recall the finer details of a book I read 3 months ago and if I had to wait more than 6 I would feel the need to re-read the series to refresh my memory.

I also do the same formula [wait then binge the whole thing] with Netflix shows as well LOL.

But.....if I absolutely couldn't hold on to my patushka to wait that long, and just HAD to read book 1 or see S1E1 of a 2 season or more Netflix show, the most I would wait [at the max] is a year. Anything over a year is just pushing it, I say. I easily ""lose interest"" when either it takes too long for new season books/episodes to come after ""bingeing"" the original first batch of material - OR if the plot just gets too redundant or the marketing for it gets too over-saturated. 

Ex: I ""lost interest"" in G.O.T., Harry Potter series, Cobra Kai, Stranger Things, and Outlander for those very reasons. G.O.T. - too redundant after Geofrey's funeral sex scene. Harry Potter - lost interest at book 4 when it was same ole' plot. Cobra Kai, Stranger Things and Outlander - too long for latest seasons to come to Netflix? This viewer gots a life to live!

I think that‚Äôs nice cuz that means you can gain momentum with a book a year, while continually working on other things and not having to sacrifice quality. That sort of routine seems pretty self-sustaining. Plenty indie authors also seem to get the value of beta readers and editors, so you know they‚Äôre doing multiple drafts. The trouble with self-publishing is anyone can do it, and the less seasoned authors will just toss a first draft out there without any work. But the ones reaching an audience are generally going to be the ones putting the work in.
