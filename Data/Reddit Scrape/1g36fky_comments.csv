"lrv2avi","Smol-Angry-Potato","2024-10-14 11:53:24 UTC","Mine is when characters desperately need to have sex to the extent that they basically ruin their lives to have it - it’s especially irritating in apocalypse books. They either break up existing relationships to have sex or they risk everyone’s safety to sneak off and have sex when they’re supposed to be on watch or something. Even worse if the character is bi, because obviously we’re all huge sluts who go for anyone with a pulse /s. There’s usually a confrontation where the guilty characters are like “well I’m a human being, I have NEEDS!!!!”


I think it’s hard for me to sympathize with that because I don’t have a very high sex drive to begin with but I also find the thought of having sex with someone I’m not in love with repulsive. And anyway, if I was trying to survive a zombie apocalypse and some virtual stranger (who hasn’t showered in months since the apocalypse started and also we ran out of TP months ago btw) tried to seduce me while we’re guarding the compound’s suspiciously weak fence-line I’d be SO pissed off. We have more important things to worry about right now bud. Go hump a pillow and get back to me when you’re not a horny mess. Chances are I’d be dehydrated and hungry because I had to split a can of cold beans for breakfast with another virtual stranger. Where is the willpower and self restraint????? Lol",""

So many people have started to do this in fiction now and it's aggrivating.

*And this was every POV you read, multiple times in* each book. <--- *see my reputation there? Did you need that again? Nope, but the book thinks you do.*

Also, there are many chapters ending with someone showing up unexpectedly, and a battle may or may not be commencing because of it. This got very tiring.

Bit of a sidetrack but this is a big issue in TV writing these last couple of years. Everyone wants to do the Game of Thrones schtick where they make the audience hate the bad guy, but without the writing chops to make it all work. 


You get a universe where all the good/neutral characters get mercilessly punished for the slightest of character flaws or mistakes, while the baddies do braindead stupid stuff and somehow get away with it. Everyone suddenly grows compassion and forgiveness for fantasy Hitler, forgets it's been their life's mission to defeat him or just plain stands by and watches when their one-in-a-million opportunity presents itself.

I've read a bit of the threads here on Reddit, where the non-criminal/non-sadistic ASPD people talk about their experience and way of thinking and it was fascinating. It seems like one of the main symptoms of the condition is actually flattened emotions. If they do bad stuff, the main reason seems to not be sadism (of course sadistic psychopaths exist, but I'm not talking about those), but a general carelessness. They don't just show a lack of remorse and empathy, but also a lack of fear. 

Some people have said that they're adrenaline junkies, because they normally don't feel that much.  A lot of them have also said that they used to think that neurotypical people were annoyingly overdramatic and they just couldn't understand why. They felt that everyone else was weird and it took some time to figure out that they were the odd ones. One man also wrote that he had masked his lack of empathy and sadness at stuff like funerals by playing the stoic tower of strength.

Also.. I’ve known sociopaths and they harm people. They may not all be psycho killers, but the lack of empathy means they do harm those around them. I think there’s good in everyone and no one is beyond help, but it’s pretty spot on to write people without empathy as people more willing and able to harm others.

Like someone who was just put there for a couple of chapters of yearning or flirting or, god forbid, sex. Then spends the rest of the story being entirely stale and ignorable.

Oh, did a 110 year old super predator break into a high school girl's bedroom to watch her sleep because he's torn based on how attractive and succulent she seems and his desire to not be a monster?  Must be love.  Definitely the sort of guy you want to perform a c-section via tooth on ya.

So naturally I was team Jacob for a bit.  They imprint and are just Uber powerful golden retrievers of the monster world.  Except Sam Uley didn't handle rejection very well, and then hulked out and slashed up Emily's face.  After which she decided to accept his feelings for her, _totally willingly_.  And of course Jacob, after getting rejected, fell in love with a baby, which was totally cool because she had an adult mind and it wasn't _romantic_ love until she was 7 years old.

After that I was team Blade, who unfortunately did not make an appearance in the series to correct the problems.

But soooooo many romance-style novels have the guy be both a literal and figurative monster who the protagistic transforms and tames all Beauty and the Beast-style.  Which for the record, if a guy ever kidnaps you and your dad and locks you up in his castle, try to avoid confusing Stockholm Syndrom with love.

For the record I'm a 52 year old man who only read Twilight in order to accurately tease peeps who were reading it.","lrtuaye"

"lrvoljh","HeroIsAGirlsName","2024-10-14 14:24:39 UTC","My absolute pet peeve is when the story is about people putting on a play/writing a book/etc and the story within the story is clearly just a bunch of random scenes slapped together to fit in with whatever is happening in the main story, without any internal consistency. (Obviously, this does not apply to situations where the play is shitty on purpose and that's the joke.) 

If a story with the story takes up a significant amount of the characters' (and readers') time, then the author should come up with a basic outline that makes sense and functions as a story, even if they don't write the whole thing, or even show their working to the readers. It doesn't have to be complicated but it should have at least some kind of backbone and the characters within the story should be reasonably consistent, as opposed to ""well in this scene I want the actors to kiss."" Because characters within a metafictional framing device still need to have some kind of basic characterisation beyond just ""generic hero"" or ""wisecracking sidekick"" and the actual prose/dialogue needs some effort put into it as well. 

Also my OTHER pet peeve is when characters are putting a play that already exists and their lives mirror the plot. Like they're doing Romeo and Juliet, except the actress playing Juliet is dating a guy from a rival theatre troupe. Or the actress playing Lady Macbeth manipulates everything so her husband can be the lead. It's been done so many times and I've never seen one I didn't find obnoxious. It just kind of reads like ""we wanted to do Shakespeare but we couldn't be bothered to do the whole thing in iambic pentametre, so we just told the same story but worse.""","lru5zpn"

To paraphrase Thomas Ligotti, 'fear is whether or not the boogeyman is real. Horror is whether or not *you* are real.' And the juxtaposition of the terror of not knowing a man you are very much in the power of in a realism setting against the horror in a real, surrealist context of being literally at the whim of his conscious thought is intense! How much she was an whole ego tunnel in herself and how much of her identity was subject to, or outside of, the ability of Jake to orchestrate. What that means for our own existence. Which other ideas Jake cannot mutate or repress and how symbols seem to defy our superego. What that means for concepts in general but what specifically what it means in the context of depression and suicide.

Billionaires have so much more money than they could ever spend that you might not even notice the difference: a millionaire can still provide levels of luxury unimaginable to most people. Maybe they're just some trust fund kid who does charity work, or someone who had a million dollar idea and patented it.

"lrvjc3l","greencreature246","2024-10-14 13:53:29 UTC","Apocalypse/post apocalypse novels that particularly tickled my fancy:

The Seep, by Chana Porter --admittedly, far less of a swashbuckling adventure or guns-blazing good time than most PA novels tend to be, this one is more of a character and social study about a woman who winds up in a post-alien invasion...utopia. That's right. No dystopia. The aliens give humanity everything it could ever want, but after losing her wife, the MC is still unhappy and has to cope with grief, loss, alcoholism, and change. Fabulously written also. Not terribly long, but everyone I know who has read it said that it's very original and they often find themselves thinking about it.

The Parable of the Sower, by Octavia Butler --again, not much of an ""adventure"" story in the classical sense, but Butler is considered a pillar of PA fiction for a reason. This novel is a classic, especially of climate apocalypse fiction, and benefits immensely from Butler's gorgeous, compelling writing. If this is on your TBR, bump it.

The Gone-Away World by Nick Harkaway -- this is one of those books that people either love or hate, mainly down to the fact that it's written in the first person, and the author has definitely chosen a very particular style of writing that can be read as charming, or as totally irritating. Personally, I leaned in  and found it more the former than the latter, especially as the author begins to describe the very unique apocalypse that has happened in his novel and the effects that it has had on people. In that light, the narrator's buddy-buddy charm begins to feel more desperate and sad, and I found that it fleshed the piece out. But if you're annoyed by, say, the kitsch in the Fallout series, this one might be a pass for you. 

Annihilation / The Southern Reach Trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer -- oh man, Vandermeer is one of my favourite writers ever, bar none. This novel masterfully blends horror, science fiction, naturalism (or, as Vandermeer himself would likely put it, weird naturalism), and worldbuilding. It's creepy. It's original. It's well-written. It follows four women exploring an abandoned area known as Area X, which all other exploratory teams have failed to successfully return from, including the MC's husband. Highly recommend.","lrulsge"

Honestly, the book that made me think of this was The Passage.  The whole first chapter was heaping tragedies on a character that didn't even make it out of the chapter simply to be able to heap more tragedies on the main character.

"lrul5np","Spooky-Shark","2024-10-14 08:58:00 UTC","Most authors have never in their lives researched deeply a topic beyond how it is generally perceived in society. Sociopath? I guess it's something like a psychopath, someone who feels nothing? 'S gotta be a criminal, cuz if you wouldn't feel, you'd be revengeful on everybody. Lol? That's pretty much in how much depth most of writers venture in terms of research for their books. I find sociopaths to be an extremely sad demographic: the society has started to, for example, \\*somewhat\\* accept autists (even if by starting with silly positive stereotypes), while I have a feeling that sociopaths will have to wait for their turn for a looong time before the main of society realizes they're just people, like everyone in the end, just with specific psychological makeup which requires a healthy, reciprocational approach with strict boundaries that're clearly established from the beginning, where both sides are being held responsible, but there's also a good dose of human elements such as forgiveness and selflessness to mimic - that's the proper environment for a flourishing sociopath to grow in and become more socialized. Instead what we get in culture is a constant barrage of negative stereotypes about a strata of people who ""just don't feel"", and not only that, they're probably rich CEO's of the giant companies, so that everyone can hate them, be envious of them and disassociate themselves from. Basically dehumanize. You won't find it in most books though, because the research for it spans beyond most writer's ""research"" (read: google something and look for an answer a minute top). A proper writer \\*learns\\* through the process of writing, doesn't just ""produce"" empty words. If they haven't learned anything during the process of writing there's a great deal of chance the reader won't learn anything in the process of reading it either.","lrtz0it"

It’s the internal struggles when making decisions. It’s the moral compass he lives by and sometimes breaks. He’s human and makes mistakes like any normal person would.

"lru8am0","Violet2393","2024-10-14 06:17:57 UTC","I read for those reasons too, but I think there can also be books that show you things you don’t like about yourself in a positive light, or show you things about yourself from a different perspective that changes your own viewpoint and feelings. 

For example, when I was a kid, I loved Anne of Green Gables because a lot of Anne’s traits were similar to traits that I felt were shameful and weird in myself. I saw traits that I tried to diminish and hide presented as being good traits that Anne was appreciated and loved for, and while they may have gotten her into trouble as a child, they helped her achieve things she wanted as an adult. It made me see my own self  in a new light and I think there’s something powerful in that. 

And I don’t think that kind of thing is limited to children’s books. I think adult books are capable of giving someone a new perspective or a different way of seeing themselves that can be very valuable.","lru0hul"

I put spoilers on my takeaway but it's a series that actually has growth across the books.

But in Station 11 the world was wiped out by a pandemic but everyone is living in difficult spots like airports and boarded up McDonald's instead of... y'know, all the homes and living spaces that are now available? There weren't any nukes, all the infrastructure is still there.

Plenty of stores and warehouses with materials people could use for decades. And as others point out, all the knowledge is just... gone. I can understand the internet and some advanced computing disappearing but...

"lrwl39v","greencreature246","2024-10-14 17:19:23 UTC","I think the thing that really made my head spin is how often the author made a point of saying that people, like, almost solve these issues and then just walk away. They talk about one man making an electrical generator powered by a stationary bike, which is hella inefficient but...that's one ""aha!"" moment away from reinventing the water wheel or electric dam. They mention going into fully untouched homes, complete with bodies inside, and looting them and then actively choosing not to live there for...no apparent reason. There's a travelling caravan of Shakespearean actors, acting out the very last plays from ""ye olden days"", but no explanation given why they don't just stop off at a library and pick up a script for Once On This Island or Waiting for Godot or something. There was even a character who opted to literally die instead of facing the withdrawals from her ADHD medication, which...withdrawals from that kind of medication suck, but I don't believe that they are life-threatening in most cases (correct me if I'm wrong, I just found that particular passage to be quite ableist, especially when paired with the wheelchair-bound brother also choosing to sacrifice himself. Felt like a lot of ""disabled people should just nobly die in the event of an apocalypse"", which is very uncomfortable for me). Not to mention that the character now has pharmacies that are probably chock full of that kind of thing just sitting around. It felt like the author was desperately trying to create a world of scarcity where people are fighting to survive, but also needed it to be in the ghost of the ""old world"" so she could make a social point (which I was never quite sure of, she never really seemed to get around to it). I felt like a nuclear apocalypse, even a somewhat unrealistic one, would have better suited the atmosphere and tensions she was attempting to create.","lrwaudq"

A bike that can power a computer from some peddling? Even if you never switch to a water wheel, get a couple of those set up and hook them up to a water pump or something. Now your village has running water whenever two people are on bikes. Who could get food and village support in exchange for riding all day...

But yeah, I'm under the impression the author had hints of this story for a while, and when Covid hit, they found and replaced all mentions of the apocalypse that was originally nuclear or similar in scale to be a plague. (EDIT: It appears that I am wrong and the book came out in 2014. Whoops.)

Then the author didn't want to rework their apocalyptic vision and just hand waved how a nuclear apocalypse and plague apocalypse would be so different...

And for Christ's sake they supposedly had looting bands who could never find anything of use in any of these places? A still sharp kitchen knife? Tools? New tires for a makeshift carriage? Just.. c'mon.","lrwl39v"
