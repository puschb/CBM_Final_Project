""But I am not a Mouse!"" cried the Bat. ""Look at my wings. Can Mice fly? Why, I am only a Bird! Please let me go!""

The Weasel had to admit that the Bat was not a Mouse, so he let him go. But a few days later, the foolish Bat went blindly into the nest of another Weasel. This Weasel happened to be a bitter enemy of Birds, and he soon had the Bat under his claws, ready to eat him.

""You are a Bird,"" he said, ""and I am going to eat you!""

Some of those developers have been able to form new studios and go independent, but most had to accept the same type of position but for half the pay, which allowed companies to lay off existing employees with higher salaries.

The pipeline began with the old ""free"" TV (laden with commercials) which gave way to pay-for cable which began losing ground to cheaper pay-for streaming which morphed into pay-for streaming with ads, ad nauseam.

Many IPs changed hands along all those routes and now a tiny handful of companies own & control a huge majority of every series and movie we see.

"lxxrod7","AnonymousCoward261","2024-11-19 15:18:11 UTC","In a post-AI economy, middlemen could still hold relevance due to the following reasons:

1. **Human Relationships and Trust**: Despite AI's efficiency, people often feel more comfortable and assured when they can interact with a person, especially in high-stakes or emotionally charged transactions (e.g., real estate, large investments). Middlemen can build trust, mediate disputes, and offer a human touch that AI might lack.

2. **Complex Decision-Making and Nuance**: Some transactions require a deep understanding of social context, emotional intelligence, or cultural sensitivity, which can be challenging for AI to fully replicate. Middlemen can interpret subtle nuances and make value-based judgments that an AI might overlook, adding value through their experience and insight.

3. **Ethical Oversight and Risk Management**: In a heavily automated economy, middlemen can serve as ethical or regulatory checkpoints, ensuring that AI-driven processes align with human values and legal standards. For instance, brokers in financial sectors might act as a buffer to ensure AI recommendations meet compliance and ethical guidelines, reducing potential risks.

4. **Customization and Personalization**: Middlemen can offer personalized services, adapting recommendations based on individual preferences, lifestyles, or unstructured goals that may not be easily quantifiable for an AI. For instance, a travel agent could tailor a complex itinerary based on personal feedback, cultural subtleties, or specific desires that may be hard to encode fully into an AI system.

5. **Mediating Between Competing AIs**: In a landscape where different AI systems compete for market share, middlemen can navigate between AI tools, optimizing decisions by leveraging the strengths of various platforms. A middleman can act as a knowledgeable guide, using insights from multiple systems to find the best solutions for clients.

Middlemen, therefore, may evolve to become more of a bridge between AI-driven efficiency and the human need for connection, context, and ethical assurance, ensuring that the benefits of AI can be harnessed while addressing its potential limitations.","lxt9yu0"

So they believe that selling out authors to train models that generate content is short sighted. Because that just leads to NOONE buying content however generated.

The push to train AI to generate content is also shortsighted because what we don't lack is generated content. It's the eyeball's time that is the limit, and just ""cutting cost and generating minimal revenue in the short term"" isn't going to solve that issue.

Like, even in the ideal case where you just prompt an AI and get a perfectly written and creative novel out of it that has something to say AND is entertaining. It still will just evaporate any noteworthy revenue stream beside ""paying for the power it required"".

So instead of deciding on supporting a creator or not (which are at the current point the only two relevant questions, whether it's piracy or used books), it's just going to be at WORST pirating the AI base, and then getting anything you want for free, with no creators left to optionally pay.

Those that aim high, even if they fail to achieve what they hoped in early books, are still writing for readers with an eye for art and can't be replaced with AI. Even their ""slop"" has an artistic element to it that's completely unlike the most competent novel by a ""lowbrow"" (I hate that term but it's convenient shorthand here) author. For example, Ishiguro's first novel was a bit rough, but it's in a separate universe from anything by James Patterson.

Those that aim low (like Patterson) aren't even attempting anything that probably can't be accomplished just as well with AI, at least eventually.

Young people seem to buy books because people they follow recommend them, and I'm not really hearing about these influencers recommending AI slop yet.

Since NVIDIA makes its money selling the hardware that AIs run on it makes business sense for them to give away the tools needed for people to build those AIs.

Nemotron-4 actually consists of two different AIs. One, ""Nemotron-4 Instruct"", is given raw source documents and generates training material off of it. For example if you wanted to train an AI to be good at literary analysis and review you might give it the raw text of a novel and then tell it to write a conversation between an AI and a fictional human user about it. Then a separate AI, ""Nemotron-4 Reward"", evaluates the resulting output to determine whether it's good training material or not.

The end result is large amounts of training material that is formatted well for the sort of thing you want the AI to be able to do (conversation about books, in this case) and that is grounded in ""real"" source material but that isn't actually the source material itself. You can get a lot more training material out of a limited amount of source documents this way.","lxt1i72"

*All because we fell for the lies and the hate,*  
*And abandoned our place in a world that's ever great.*

*So let this be a lesson, oh ye citizens of this land,*

The problem AI companies have now is a signal to noise problem. Synthetic data cannot solve this, not at scale because it needs variety. Your original data, made by a human will have errors, noise. but will still be the ground truth of your model. To throw numbers out, lets say your data set contains 90% signal, 10% noise. Any resulting trained model will have noise, and cannot produce data with a higher signal that the input data set. Lets say we're in Gen1, where everything you grab from the internet is this 90/10. ChatGPT, Midsummer, Stable diffusion, flood the public channels with generated content. inferior generated content that adds noise. For a while it's easy to distinguish signal and noise, because the noise has so much error. But as it iterates and the AI models start outputting less noise, harder to distinguish errors, the process of collecting your initial dataset will be impossible to do with a scrapper. Because it won't be able to distinguish between real data, and synthetic. The error will accumulate over generations, and you're model refinement will plateau. Now they have to grab ""clean data"" from actual people to reduce the noise and get a better model. 

The race right now it to get the more refined, more accurate models with the data they can collect. Will it be ""enough"" for companies / people.","lxtrohg"
