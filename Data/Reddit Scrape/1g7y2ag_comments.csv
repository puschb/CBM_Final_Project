Sometimes as I’m reading, I think about what I will write too haha, like for example right now I’m listening to a book whose main character I hate, and I can’t wait to write about why I hate him lol. 

That being said, my mom asked me to send her emails with reviews of every book I read so she can get recommendations. She doesn’t have Goodreads/isn’t great with technology lol. So I do end up writing a short review for every book in the end lol, I usually write her like 1-2 sentences though and it’s just a short summary/blurb and high points of why I did or didn’t like it but also I try to tailor it to her tastes too. ",""

Just have a conversation about the problem. Even if it's just with yourself.

I don't know how old you are, but at some point the more and better you remember EVERYTHING you have seen, particularly in fiction, you get to the point of everything already being (involuntarily or not) derivative and repetitive. And that is fine, because in some way or another it's targeted at the next and next generation of people who haven't read the things you have. So it's new to them.

If you couple that with the statistical notion of it becoming increasingly more likely that ""the best version (yes, to you) of a concept is one you already DID read/watch"" the bigger the pool of ""things you already read/watched"" gets...

"ltdus71","bread-is-my-friend","2024-10-23 18:38:28 UTC","I think I would like it if Goodreads had a private review function so I could express my thoughts about books without others seeing it. Currently I track my books on goodreads and in a spreadsheet and in the spreadsheet I have a cell for writing any comments I have. The good news is that actually expressing your thoughts on books makes your brain less scrambled though lol","lsu443j"

"lswfosv","canijusttalkmaybe","2024-10-20 20:39:53 UTC","> Sometimes as I’m reading, I think about what I will write too haha, like for example right now I’m listening to a book whose main character I hate, and I can’t wait to write about why I hate him lol.

Most characters are pretty meh. Every once in a great moon, there's a character that's exceptionally memorable. But for my liking, finding a character you can really hate is a delight.","lsu77qa"

"lsvoejy","Dry_Writing_7862","2024-10-20 18:21:48 UTC","Same. Specific thoughts only. More so, I review some books on social media if I feel led but certainly not every book. I feel like a star rating suffices just fine.","lsutgxs"
"lsvwgp4","violetmemphisblue","2024-10-20 19:02:44 UTC","I agree! I find GoodReads reviews and the like to be kind of worthless in determining what to read. In part because of the people who review the way you mention (Character is named Kyle, I hate that name, I couldn't read it! Or, story took place in my hometown, love to see it, five stars!) And in part because so many ""reviews"" are actually book reports. I don't want a full synopsis! Or they're meaningless to me because Katie just puts it's her favorite book of the year, but I don't know what else Katie has been reading, so what's it in competition with? At most, if I'm picking for a book club or something, I'll scan reviews to make sure the book seems in alignment with the vibe of the group, but the rest of it just makes me kind of roll my eyes...like, go for it and have fun, but it's not really that serious.","lsuzp2w"

"lsy4mau","goatlover19","2024-10-21 02:42:21 UTC","I won’t yuck someone else’s yum in reviews. Yes, the reviews are for other readers but that also includes readers that enjoy the book. A 3 star or below rating says everything it needs to. I don’t need to go into detail why I don’t like a specific book.

And 2. I don’t work well when I am being expected to give an opinion on something I know that someone put a lot of effort in. Unfortunately I didn’t like the book and then I was in the dilemma of what to say because they was on me for my opinion. I think I wrote something like “This book is a rollercoaster ride with too much alcohol involved.” The books MC drank way too much and kept making stupid choices because of it, I only finished it because the author kept checking in with me… 🤦🏾‍♀️","lsu5xxs"

I initially wrote a very mild review but then found the authors social media where they posted screenshots of negative reviews and absolutely bashed on perfectly fine critique: calling reviewers names, saying they lack critical thinking and good taste. So mean! I went back and rewrote my review to be more straightforward and it get sooo good tbh","lsu5xxs"

Yes I built it (I am an iOS developer). I couldn’t find exactly what I wanted which is a book tracker with a focus on note-taking and free of all kinds of distractions. 

Also, I usually read classics and I have a few books which are « Complete » editions with many stories in a single volume, like « Complete Stories » of Edgar Poe. 

I was surprised to see that there wasn’t a single app which could support multi-stories books. 

As for the time, it took me about 2 months to create a minimum viable product and another 2 months to fix all the bugs, improve the UX, make it less a « me » app and more a « everybody’s » app.","lsvt8rk"
