It was **Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus** by Orson Scott Card. 

I first read it in my 20s, when it was first published. I loved the whole time-travel / alternate history premise. That's one of my favourite sub-genres, and Card writes good stories (yes: I separate the art from the artist). I enjoyed the book for its surface-level story, and then put it on my bookshelf along with all the other books I enjoyed and intended to re-read again at some point in the future. 

Then, some time in my 40s, I finally picked it up again and decided to re-read it, to revisit this story I'd enjoyed all those years ago. 

Wow. How could I have missed the glaring subtext that Christianity was the way to save history? The whole point of the plot was to make sure that Christianity was spread throughout the Americas and that the Native Americans were converted to Christianity, which would make history great again (pun most definitely intended). I knew Card was a very religious person, but I'd managed to enjoy other stories and novels of his without having his religion and related opinions slapped in my face. However, **Pastwatch** was *offensively* pro-Christian to me as a lifelong atheist.

Loved reading a xenofiction book about wolves that featured a mysterious and spooky prophecy told in rhyme the first time around.

The second time around, it was difficult to not notice the misogyny. And the ableism, oh the ableism. One character attacks and berates another character for being depressed not long after a severely traumatic event, and the narrative acts as though he's in the right for doing this. That scene alone flipped my opinion of the book, but is by far not the only dodgy part of the story. There's also just a lot of bullshit in how animal behavior is portrayed. Beyond a stereotypical alpha/beta/omega pack structure, the steppe eagle is portrayed as having contempt for scavenging birds, when real steppe eagles are notable for being more inclined to scavenge than most eagles.

I went back to read the author's previous book, Fire-Bringer out of morbid curiosity, and that one was just as bad, if not worse. The misogyny and ableism were cranked up to eleven. One plot point even showed misogyny to be a moral imperative among these animals, which just kind of pushed it over the edge.",""

"lt10iqy","Low-Intern-1656","2024-10-21 16:29:23 UTC","Same, to some extent. I loved it because the writing is beautiful and I loved that Jane would literally rather die than compromise her values. And I liked that the only way she was able to be with him in the end was after he was knocked off his pedestal and she had equal if not greater power than him... however upon rereading it's hard to look past all the creepy, controlling crap he did and some people even question if his first wife was really crazy or did she go crazy *after* he trapped her in the attic for years lol. I agree it's kind of hard to say lol.","lsx04az"

"lsvjft2","trufflewine","2024-10-20 17:57:12 UTC","I lot of people love that book as teens and then reread it as adults and realize how terribly all the characters are behaving. But I think that’s a good reminder that many teens live in an emotional world where that behavior makes sense. The feelings are so big and dramatic! Putting things into perspective takes time and experience. Emotional intelligence and wisdom are things people have to develop. Sometimes people forget that teens (especially younger ones) are often not that that developmental stage yet. ","lstt3tz"

At the same time, it's a kids' adventure story, it's not really going to work if all the adults are sane and responsible. It's like wondering why Nancy Drew's father doesn't ever seem too bothered that his 17 year old is running off to try and catch middle-aged international jewel thieves -- because it's not aimed at people her father's age.","lsv28hx"

Also sadly you'd be surprised at just how many kids get abused and even die because of things their parents deliberately sent them to.
