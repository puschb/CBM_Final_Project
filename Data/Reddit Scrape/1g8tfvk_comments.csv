"lt1hn95","police-ical","2024-10-21 17:56:39 UTC","It's a bit of a messy article. In part it seems to be attacking a sort of odd straw-man belief, the idea that if you just write like Orwell, it will lead you to the correct thought. It argues that because Orwell and Chesterton had divergent politics and thinking but similar prose, this must not be the case. Did anyone actually think this was the case? 

Plenty of bad thinkers have plain words, plenty of good thinkers have complicated words. I would read ""Politics and the English Language"" as basically making a good case for how inflated and technical prose CAN obscure clear thinking and communication. It nowhere implies that clear prose will actually LEAD you to your conclusions, just that he preferred clear prose because it avoided some pitfalls.

I'll give the author some credit for breaking down any idea that Orwell was about middle-of-the-road beliefs and not taking stances. The guy left home to personally fight fascism at the earliest possible opportunity. He didn't just stick his neck out, he took a bullet in it. Orwell believed in fighting like hell for what you believed in, while acknowledging uncertainty and keeping your own moral compass, knowing that movements can quickly overshoot and turn into echo chambers.

I think the broad point is that everyone wants to claim Orwell's legacy, because he was frequently on the right side of history at a time when many weren't, and that his prose and sense of humor have aged well.",""

But mostly politics. It gives you a much better understanding of where he was coming from. You can read things however you like but it is at least interesting to know what the author thought.

He was really only getting his eye in as a novelist when he died. His earlier novels, with the possible exception of Coming Up For Air, are read mainly because of his later work. Also Burmese Days is a so-so novel but a good document of colonialism. But others may disagree.

> The unspoken clause is always 'not counting ni**ers'. For how can we make a 'firm stand' against Hitler if we are simultaneously weakening ourselves at home? In other words, how can we 'fight Fascism' except by bolstering up a far vaster injustice?

This was in response to a book published at that time that called for the democratic countries to form an alliance to combat Hitler.

Orwell was astute enough to see that what the Nazis and Fascists are doing is essentially taking the next logical step in what the Brits and French are already doing in Asia and Africa since the 19th century.

He was as much of a critic of British and French colonisation as he was of Nazism, Fascism, and Communism. Somehow, the mainstream only highlights one side of his. Go figure why.",""

"lt27ns1","Ikorodude","2024-10-21 20:09:47 UTC","> Most of the Orwell cult only irritates, but one thing legitimately grates: the idea of Eric Blair as a monument to British decency. The author of 1984 not only wrote a deathbed list for the authorities denouncing notable writers and public figures as Communist sympathisers. He had meticulously kept throughout the last decade of his life a paranoid notebook filled with 135 names.

> These, he had variously labelled what he called “cryptos,” “F.T.s” for fellow travellers, or those he alleged were Stalinist sympathisers, suspect agents or outright members of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Orwell’s list included figures as eminent as the future leader of the Labour Party Michael Foot, the broadcaster and writer J.B. Priestly, and the historian E.H. Carr. Whilst occasionally it was right, more often than not the list was absurd.

> There is a notable and obvious overlap in Orwell’s notebook between many of 1940s London’s prominent gay, Jewish and anti-colonial public figures and the accused “cryptos.” Orwell’s bigoted commentaries fill his suspects notebook. Jews are clearly labeled (“Polish Jew,” “English Jew,” “Jewess”) whilst others were mislabeled (“Charlie Chaplin — Jewish?”). The African-American bass singer and future civil rights activist Paul Robeson finds himself in Orwell’s list with the note “very anti-white,” whilst the half-Jewish poet Stephen Spender is damned as a “sentimental sympathiser… tendency towards homosexuality.” Orwell was a British McCarthyite before the hour. It was only Orwell’s death in 1950 that saved his reputation from his paranoia.

He was also a rapist, serial according to Wifedom by Anna Funder

>Venables is the Buddicoms’ first cousin, and was left the copyright to Eric & Us, as well as 57 crates of family letters. From these she made the shocking discovery that, in 1921, Eric had tried to rape Jacintha. Previously the young couple had kissed, but now, during a late summer walk, he had wanted more. At only five feet to his six feet and four inches, Jacintha had shouted, screamed and kicked before running home with a torn skirt and bruised hip. It was “this” rather than any gradual parting of the ways that explains why Jacintha broke off all contact with her childhood friend, never to learn that he had transformed himself into George Orwell 

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/17/georgeorwell.biography

His comrades in Spain didn’t like him and didn’t think he was committed to the cause:

> Much time was also spent engaged in political arguments, where ‘the conflicting party “lines” were debated over and over’. Orwell did not endear himself to his comrades by laughing at what he felt to be their political naivety. Like Pollitt and McNair before them, many volunteers were acutely aware of Orwell’s ‘cut-glass Eton accent’ and east Londoner Frank Frankford said he disliked the ‘supercilious bastard’ on sight:

> He really didn’t like the workers… It was his attitude in discussions that I didn’t like, his attitude towards the working class. Two or three of us said that he was on the wrong side, he should be on the other side… I rather think he fancied himself as another Bernard Shaw… There was no depth to his socialism at all.

In the Brust essay I'm thinking of, he states that the technology is making surveillance so easy that it's inevitable that it's going to be used. He then goes on to compare a society where surveillance is omnipresent and the results of the spying are only available for the government to use to keep tabs on its citizens and one where the results of the spying are available to everyone, allowing the people to keep tabs on their elected leaders. It's definitely something to think about as the technology he speculates about is not only here but being deployed.","lt2xjp2"

I don't know where you get that impression from; Orwell's list did **not** lead to spying. [Timothy Garton Ash investigated the list](https://archive.fo/pkoZS) and found that the individuals in the list did **not** suffer any actual blacklisting or spying:

> Consider who some of the people on the list were, and what happened to them. Peter Smollett was singled out by Orwell for special mention in his covering letter to Celia. Under “Remarks” on his list, Orwell noted: “…gives strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent. Very slimy person.” Born in Vienna as Peter Smolka, during World War II Smollett was the head of the Soviet section in the British Ministry of Information—one of Orwell’s inspirations for the Ministry of Truth. [...] How, then, did the British state prosecute or persecute this Soviet agent? By making him an Officer of the British Empire (OBE). Subsequently, he was the London *Times* correspondent in Central Europe. The worst thing that seems to have happened to him is that some of his short stories about postwar Vienna were heavily drawn upon by Graham Greene for *The Third Man*. [...]

> The Labour MP Tom Driberg—“Usually named as ‘crypto,’ but in my opinion NOT reliably pro-CP”—was, according to the Mitrokhin KGB papers, recruited in 1956 as a doubtless deeply unreliable Soviet agent (codename LEPAGE), after a compromising homosexual encounter with an agent of the KGB’s Second Chief Directorate in a lavatory under the Metropole hotel in Moscow. Nonetheless, he ended his life as a celebrated writer and Lord Bradwell of Bradwell juxta mare. E.H. Carr, Isaac Deutscher, the novelist Naomi Mitchison (a “silly sympathiser”), and J.B. Priestley all pursued very successful careers without, so far as we know, any hindrance from the British government. [...]

> The only case of anything like a possible “blacklisting” that I have found so far is that of Alaric Jacob, a minor writer who had attended the same private school as Orwell and followed his subsequent progress with resentment. According to one study of British political vetting, Alaric Jacob joined the BBC monitoring service at Caversham in August 1948, but in February 1951 was “suddenly refused establishment rights, which meant he would receive no pension.” He complained to his cousin, the same Sir Ian Jacob who had dealings with IRD and later became director general of the BBC. Alaric Jacob’s establishment and pension rights were restored shortly after his wife—Iris Morley, who also appears on Orwell’s list—died in 1953.","lt1zklg"

itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High group, unlike all
its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard
its position. It had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy
is collectivism. Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are
possessed jointly. The so-called ’abolition of private property’ which took place
in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property
in far fewer hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners
were a group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the
Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the Party
owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and disposes of the
products as it thinks fit. In the years following the Revolution it was able to step
into this commanding position almost unopposed, because the whole process was
represented as an act of collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the
capitalist class were expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably
the capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses, transport
— everything had been taken away from them: and since these things were no
longer private property, it followed that they must be public property. Ingsoc,
which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement and inherited its phraseology,
has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme; with the
result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been
made permanent.

In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening.

Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares. But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell’s dark vision, there was another — slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think. What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ‘failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.’ In Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.”*

>“Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.“

Although, [Quote 2](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6979215-the-words-democracy-socialism-freedom-patriotic-realistic-justice-have-each):

>The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way.

So i'd agree he was a proponent of democratic socialism and liberal democracy, or, at least whatever those terms meant in the 1940s-50s.","lt1mrzf"

As an individual yes, it is likely that it is equivalent to 1984, maybe a bit better, from the philosophy of reducing suffering, but in dystopian terms it is worse as it talks about a complete suppression of the human spirit by making them complacent. 

This is like saying it's a ""better world"" because the authoritarian power has managed to twist the minds of the people already, thus the people have become their own jailors.

"lt5gmtv","AnonymousCoward261","2024-10-22 10:36:11 UTC","I was thinking about what you wrote all day, believe it or not.

The problem is that global equity would require lowering the standard of living of people in rich countries to something greater than that of people in poor countries but still much lower than what it is now, and if you have any kind of vaguely democratic government people tend to react against that quite strongly. The development of China and all the people who got lifted out of poverty there also resulted in the deindustrialization of the American interior, which ultimately led to the right-populist revolt we're seeing now. Even one-party states like China are concerned with the standard of living of their own people in order to prevent revolts.

So your only way to really accomplish what you want is a takeover by a revolutionary vanguard of the government of rich countries that forcibly redistributes wealth to poor countries (which is going to be overthrown relatively rapidly, especially in the USA with its armed populace), or waiting for the rich countries to collapse so they can be overthrown by poor countries. If you try to help this process along all of the citizens of the rich world will quite reasonably view you as treasonous and attack you.

That isn’t to say that Orwell was not homophobic (or a social reactionary in many other respects) - he very much was - but I find your narrative wildly simplistic. Orwell’s list was essentially a ‘do not hire’ advisory piece of paper which he almost certainly saw as combating Soviet influence in the British Parliament/press/civil service leaking through to counter intelligence - Orwell never made secret his extreme dislike for the USSR, or the British left wing ‘intellegentsia’ and never felt that it conflicted with his socialism (judge that as you will). He also repeatedly affirmed his opposition to any kind of British McCarthyism or for proscriptions against communist party members - he wrote the list specifically regarding suitability for counter-intelligence.

There’s very little evidence of how seriously the Information Research Department took Orwell’s list, but there’s no evidence that it was used as any kind of hit list, or that it was taken as anything more than advisory. Orwell is a complicated (often questionable) figure but to dumb him down to a reactionary ass is no service to the actual truth whatsoever.","lt2pnx6"

I've heard people call mask mandates Orwellian, when the far more Orwellian event was staring directly at an outbreak of a highly contagious disease with unknown but clearly startling health complications and saying ""everything is fine"".

I think the problem though is that this cuts to why dystopian fiction very often isn't a particularly good or useful tool for politics. The standard template that 1984 pretty much created (drawing inspiration from the reality of totalitarian regimes) and then 90% of all dystopian novels ever down to your average YA ""really special kid fights the system"" sludge replicate is that there's a System, there's Power, and they want you to believe a Lie to control you - but you, brave fighter for truth, can resist this (and either win in the end or die tragically, I guess, but either way you are at least made special even in defeat by your defiance).

Notice something? The people who *best* match that mindset, that lens used to interpret the world, are also the most unhinged conspiracy theorists.

Everyone has some kind of ""truth"" they believe in, and sometimes that truth is nonsense, but of course if they realised that they wouldn't believe it in the first place. And of course if you believe something insane and everyone just *happens* to tell you it's insane you may as well suspect they're all in cahoots to force you to change your mind, to refuse the obvious truth of your eyes and ears, to shut you up. Thus, it's rebellious and defiant and heroic to do the exact opposite.

When it came to COVID, for most people, the source of information about it, about what risks it could pose or whether it was real at all, was media, and very often, politicians speaking through them. The fact that even if you caught the disease you had a fair chance of not suffering from anything worse than a cold or a flu made things even more complicated. For many people, ""the evidence of their eyes and ears"" was indeed that COVID was a nothingburger, and that they were being asked to do grand, extraordinary and unusual things that severely curtailed their personal freedom (honestly, the lockdowns *were* a truly unusual and extreme measure) just out of trust in those institutions, those media and politicians. And their baseline is always to assume that those media and politicians are lying and acting out of self-interest to screw them over, so even without understanding very clearly *why* this would be a plot, they simply assumed it must be one. It really didn't help that for politics reasons those same politicians sometimes *did* flip their position almost overnight (Boris Johnson in the UK did that a lot. And on masks there was an epic 180 early on from ""they're useless for people who aren't healthcare workers"" to ""everyone wear them"". Again, politics - nothing particularly nefarious. But it obviously hurts credibility).

So, yeah, real societies are complicated like that. Dystopian fiction, 1984 included, is a tool to discuss about certain kinds of issues, but it's an extremely simplified tool that unfortunately has damaged a lot our discourse because it gets wielded in many inappropriate situations and has become a staple of how many people think about the world. In reality vast coordinated flawless efforts to deceive everyone simultaneously are quite hard to organize, but dystopian fiction rarely teaches you *how* to distinguish between a truly evil manipulative totalitarian government and a merely shitty regular one that occasionally, like a broken clock, *does* say the correct thing, if only because its interests coincidentally align with yours. I don't know what a novel that goes into that would look like, but I suspect it would come off quite a bit messier and probably more boring than a true tale of absolute irresistible evil.","lt23znu"
