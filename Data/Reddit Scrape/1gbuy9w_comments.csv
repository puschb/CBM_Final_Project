"ltpthss","Not-original","2024-10-25 17:35:22 UTC","Wish I could tell you that the book gets better, it doesn't :(   

It felt very much like a send up of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -- the author even writes at the end that he wants to be the anti-Jk Rowling.   So you have a Umbridge character (but she doesn't come close) and a Dumbledore character (again, not close).   And the story suffers.   There are no stakes, or danger for our heroes -- the whole time reading, you don't feel like there is any real conflict. 

You have these 7 magical children and their two dads, and they all get along.  No fights, no spats. Not even when a new child/Yeti is brought into the house.    They all just continue being perfect and friendly and welcoming.  It's the ""evil"" government official trying to destroy everything -- why?  Um, I don't know.  Neither does the author.",""

"ltvgps0","FoghornLegday","2024-10-26 16:45:24 UTC","Extraordinaries unfortunately is not without politics. I DNF‚Äôed the second one for beating me over the head with anti cop stuff. But I really liked the first one!","ltursvk"

"ltuadex","DrQuestDFA","2024-10-26 12:32:04 UTC","It was weird we were told the world hated magical kids and creatures but never why.  In the real world we can understand the roots of various racist thoughts, all we really needed to know in the book is something like ‚Äúmagical kids can‚Äôt control their powers and often hurt others, especially kids.‚Äù  It would be no less stupid than real world racism and would at least give us an angle to understand the world the kids live in and why they are treated as they are.","ltu8g92"
"ltpmn04","BirdAndWords","2024-10-25 17:00:53 UTC","Executing a political message well in a novel is a challenge and I don‚Äôt think all authors are up to that task.","ltp5737"
"lttdutz","FoghornLegday","2024-10-26 07:14:09 UTC","Yes, that‚Äôs why I DNF‚Äôed the extraordinaries series!","ltp5737"

"ltte6b9","FoghornLegday","2024-10-26 07:17:30 UTC","The problem isn‚Äôt that there‚Äôs a message, it‚Äôs that the reader is beaten over the head with the message on every page. The story takes a backseat to the preaching, and that‚Äôs a problem","ltp5mdj"
"ltp8b8h","it_is_Karo","2024-10-25 15:48:08 UTC","In order to enjoy the first book, you have to forget that it was inspired by native kids being separated from their families and treated horribly, and immerse yourself in the fantasy world. I'm just saying that in the 2nd book, you can't really separate real life problems from the fantasy world because it's mentioned constantly. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying that I'm reading fantasy to forget about the shitty real world. I'd read nonfiction if I wanted to dive deeper into political issues.","ltp5mdj"
"ltpca8l","InvisibleSpaceVamp","2024-10-25 16:08:23 UTC","All fiction is inspired by real life issues because authors don't live in a vacuum but not all fiction is telling you what the author's opinion is and what opinion you're supposed to end up with. Fiction can be inspired but still remain apolitical.","ltpah7j"
"ltprvon","Julianhtc","2024-10-25 17:27:14 UTC","I think it comes as a shock because in book 1, you don‚Äôt get this sense of ‚Äúpreachiness‚Äù. It‚Äôs a book with a solid plot, lovable characters, and lots of beautiful life lessons. Naturally you‚Äôd expect the same from book 2, but it seems like it‚Äôs entirely different. 
I haven‚Äôt read book 2 but based on similar reviews, I don‚Äôt want to since it seems totally different from book 1","ltp6kau"
"ltpalbh","LazySwanNerd","2024-10-25 15:59:37 UTC","Almost all fantasy is an allegory of real world problems and is inspired by such.","ltp8b8h"
"ltpicli","blue_sidd","2024-10-25 16:39:27 UTC","I guess i fundamentally disagree that fiction can he apolitical, since choosing to write is political and choosing what to write as much what not to write us political - so obviousness seems to be the transgression in this case (poor writing aside). Which also strikes me as odd since Klune‚Äôs writing has been so obviously political from the start it seems like an odd criticism of his books. Bad writing? Sure, totally on board with DNF because of it.","ltpca8l"
"ltq66q4","DrQuestDFA","2024-10-25 18:39:50 UTC","I actually found the first book to also be very, very heavy handed with its message (one I agreed with) to the detriment of the story (among other factors that torpedo the story for me).","ltprvon"
"ltplqkx","CarpeDiemMaybe","2024-10-25 16:56:23 UTC","Maybe some people like it better when it doesn‚Äôt beat your head with the message. A little more symbolism and subtlety could be what they wanted? People had similar issues with RF Kuang‚Äôs books even if they agree with her intentions","ltpicli"
"ltq7ske","Julianhtc","2024-10-25 18:48:04 UTC","Oh interesting. I guess everyone perceives it in a different manner","ltq66q4"
"ltq8yal","DrQuestDFA","2024-10-25 18:54:00 UTC","Yup, different strokes for different folks.  For me the 10th time the book made the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be judge a book by its cover‚Äù I was rolling my eyes.  I get the message, I agree with the message, please give me a decent story and less bludgeoning of my head with the message.","ltq7ske"
"ltq9aze","Julianhtc","2024-10-25 18:55:48 UTC","Did you happen to read Under the Whispering Door? I enjoyed the story but felt like it was too preachy regarding ‚Äúloving life‚Äù","ltq8yal"
"ltq9ju4","DrQuestDFA","2024-10-25 18:57:03 UTC","Nope, that was the only Kline I have read, and it was for a book club.","ltq9aze"
