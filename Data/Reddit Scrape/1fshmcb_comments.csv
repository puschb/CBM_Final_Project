"lpkn77s","sashavie","2024-09-29 23:42:02 UTC","It's the hero's journey applied to capitalism, which runs deeper in the US (and to some degree Canada) than Europe

So much of self-help is rooted in the hero's journey narrative - there is a ""before"" state, and then a call to action/adventure, in which you then become the hero in your own journey towards the ""after"" state (the ""after state"" being financial success)

Even if a lot of self-help no longer explicitly talks about financial success, the undertone of ""boost your productivity"" or ""hacks"" or ""transform your life"" and so forth - there is an implicit contract between the author and audience that it's ultimately about getting rich

Even the so-called ""health"" self-help isn't really about health, but about vanity (get better looking), because being better looking will allow you to move up the ladder in your work, get that promotion, investment in your biz etc (""I once was fat but now I'm skinny, and now I have more money"")

This hero's journey narrative isn't coming from self-help, but is deeply embedded in the story of America, from the American Dream as well as the founding of the country - the ""story"" is often framed that way --  
a ragtag group of free thinkers being taxed to death by these British oppressors; the call to action is the declaration of independence (""give me liberty or give me death!"") - the call to action being this heroic revolution where all these free thinking men banded together in the name of liberty to overthrow the most powerful Empire in the world (the call to action), which leads to the ""after state"" of the founding of this great and glorious nation of free thinkers, whose success is only limited by one's imagination

Americans see history through this framing - the hero's journey - to such an extent that they often don't realize that it's unique in its extremes compared to other countries

In Europe and Asia, there is some element of the hero's journey applied to certain episodes of one's cultural past, but not to the same extreme like Americans try and frame everything about their history and values in this way -- in Europe and Asia, they see their history more like Game of Thrones; Americans see their history as Star Wars

And in a Star Wars culture, the self-help ""you are the hero in your own life"" is a byproduct of that",""
"lplb48b","Vanillacaramelalmond","2024-09-30 02:20:25 UTC","This is just my observation as a Canadian who watches a lot of British TV and movies, but English people seem to have a very different relationship with class than North Americans. It feels like a lot of North Americans aspire to be middle class, and chasing middle-class ideals is almost seen as a moral obligation. But English people tend to really respect the Everyman and turn those kinds of people into heroes. They seem very down-to-earth and admire others who are also down-to-earth, messy, and flawed. In North America, the Everyman or Everywoman doesn't really exist in the same way in public view, and if they do, they’re not beloved or respected.

For North Americans, striving for middle-class ideals often means fine-tuning yourself to perfection and losing your grittier parts. But English people don't seem to do this (maybe for the same reason they don’t care about getting braces) because they don't mind imperfections. That's where self-help books come in. A good example is how being called ""posh"" is an insult in the UK, and people are mocked for rising above their station, whereas in North America, it's expected, encouraged, and admired.

On the flip side, as an outsider, it sometimes seems like English culture can take this too far. There’s often a crabs-in-a-bucket mentality, and it feels like it can be hard to make changes or have tough conversations when everyone’s encouraged to just accept themselves as they are.

In a country where a lot of people believe that hard work always pays off, it's easy to sell a book genre that pretty much ignores the possibility of the method sucking - it's always the person's fault if they don't get the results they wanted.

The self-help type books I've been recommended by a psychologist and a psychotherapist have very different approaches: one starts with mapping your core life values and then guides you to a slow process of bringing your life closer to those values, the other one familiarizes you with ""life traps"", and introduces methods that can be used to deal with them so they stop controlling your life.

We believe that we're supposed to be happier, more in love, smarter, more popular, etc., so we seek out the books that will help us become who we are actually ""meant"" to be. 

Colin Hay (an Australian) has a song called ""Waiting for My Real Life to Begin"" which I have always felt was his taking the piss at Americans. (And if it isn't, it definitely could be.)

"lpm9ssj","Petah55","2024-09-30 07:38:09 UTC","One thing to consider is this:
Self-help books are consumed mostly through our logical, rational and intellectual mind. That mind loves to understand. ""Understand"" meaning here not the act of practicing something and getting better at it, but rather the act of simulating on one's imagination what it would be like to have done those things. 


Like you know how people like to daydream about how they are rockstars, celebrities, amazing athletes and so on? When reading self help books, it's almost like an invitation to imagine what it would be like to better - instead of actually doing it. 


During the reading process that can feel great. But once you're done reading, applying feels really hard (especially with the constant availability of distractions today, but even in generations before). So then the mind does it's usual thing, craving for more satisfaction through ""understandind"" it goes: ""Maybe I haven't understood enough, or maybe there's a better way still! Let's do more research!"" And you get the next book, self help course, etc.


It can be an unpleasant cycle.


Plus, many self help books by desing are written that way, consciously or subconsciously - the same formula to keep you reading. Given that many people don't have a guide to help them learn how to apply knowledge from self-help books, it's understandable that they are drawn into a spiral. ""I read another one and I still don't feel different. Maybe the next one will do."" And so on.


One major problem is that there are only a handful of self-help books that have been scientific vetted. I can only think of two. And those are not as fun to read by the way, constantly reminding you to so exercises, sometimes going into great detail regarding the mechanisms. Amazing books, too. But that doesn't protect them from the person applying the same mechanism. 


And at some point people are overwhelmed with the methods and how to apply them. So, say it with me: ""Maybe there's a book that can help with that!""


I mean, imagine if you go to a fitness trainer and instead of guiding you through 6-8 good exercises slowly, keeping track that you do them for a few months, he just starts showing you 5 exercises per day, every day for two weeks. He never makes sure you do them, he just shows them to you, gushing about how amazing they are always making sure to point out that his program is probably the most amazing one. And once you're done listening to him, nothing has changed, so you hire the next one. Rinse and repeat.


Now apply that to a culture, where many people feel desparate, are in poverty and have lived through adverse events up to traumas, sometimes carrying generational trauma in their backpacks too, always connected to the world with this smartphone, spending time on platforms that feed their anxiety and depression circuits. 


Tell those people that it's in their hand as individuals to save themselves (but of course always hide the statistical truth that ""anybody can make it, just not everybody"" behind the survivorship bias of the ones you present as examples of individual success - many times, authors of such books themselves btw). 


There you have the perfect recipe for a never ending chase of the silver bullet that is hiding in ""the next book maybe?""",""

"lplwi0v","must_not_forget_pwd","2024-09-30 05:11:55 UTC","Fellow Commonwealth countryman here (Australia). I agree with what 
a lot of the comments here - Americans stressing individualism. I'd add the entrepreneurial spirit.

America calls itself ""the land of opportunity"". Being an immigrant country where people would arrive because of the desire for a better life. Historically this helped with the expansion of the US West and the California Gold Rush. (From an economic perspective, America had a lot of land and few people, so that there was relatively easy money to be made if you were prepared to work for it). This then expanded out once industrialisation took hold too - there were jobs for anyone and therefore America needed more people. Hence, everyone should be able to make a good life for themselves.

This mindset played out culturally too. A minor example is the song ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" where a kid beats the Devil in a contest. That's so typically American. If it were a European song/tale, it would caution against hubris. 

Even further still, we see that American bankruptcy laws are relatively lax compared to Australia. In Australia people view bankruptcy as a stigma (literally cannot sit in Parliament if you're bankrupt) and the conditions in Australia are more onerous. In America it seems that bankruptcy isn't considered as much of a significant issue.",""

"lpkukfw","buckleyschance","2024-09-30 00:30:59 UTC","America has a particularly deep-rooted and widespread folk belief in the ""law of attraction"", a spiritual belief that thinking in a positive or negative way brings positive or negative things into your life. Some people believe it explicitly as a form of magical thinking, but many many more believe it as a sort of fuzzy pseudoscientific or supposedly commonsense idea.

It traces back to various religious movements and has been reborn under various different labels at different times. Evangelicalism and prosperity gospel are closely related, as is the whole notion of rugged individualism, the self-made man and unshakeable faith in social mobility. Also: multi-level marketing ~~scams~~ schemes.

A huge proportion of self-help books are basically repackaging the law of attraction over and over and over again, when you scratch the surface. Sometimes it's obvious and direct, like in *Think and Grow Rich* or *The Secret*. Other times it's more subtle and subtextual, like in *Girl, Wash Your Face* or *The 48 Laws of Power*. The podcast If Books Could Kill, which covers a lot of the self-help genre, has a running joke that it's all secretly one book, because the underlying themes and tricks nearly always turn out to be the same.

One of the reasons they're popular here is because there's a lot of people out there who want to feel like they're working on themselves, but don't actually want to put in the legwork to actually improve themselves. You know, they don't want to sit down and ask why they responded a certain way to certain situations, or why people always seem to find them insufferable. 

For people like that, self help books are amazing. They're filled with all these amazing truisms that most functioning adults have worked out by the time they're 22 or 23 but are new to them, so it's like they're finally learning, but they're never challenged to a point where they have to develop the self awareness to actually apply any of it. It's the exact sweet spot they're looking for. 

I think it's probably a mix of this and the fact that a lot of Americans can't afford or refuse to go to therapy. If you're in that spot, a lot of the time you need some sort of outlet so you can at least feel like you're working through it. 

Honestly, I feel like the reasons self help books resonate with a lot of people are sorta the same reasons why therapy doesn't stick with some people.

1) Celebrity culture in books: it just seems much more trendy to me for celebrities and whomever's famous to release books about themselves or their diets or their houses or ""self-care routines"" or whatever over here, and a good chunk of those land under self-help.  British celeb books seem less dominant, and when present tend to be more focused and less ""lifestyle"" based.

2) Serious non-fiction also seems somehow more popular over here to me?  Keeping in mind I'm Canada, not the US, but while non-fiction is popular as well in the UK, it tends to have less of a straight approach ime.  It's not that that's wrong, but there's a tendency for more cheekier or funny takes on non-fiction, and when played straight a preference for different topics.

And those are all next to books about clinical mental health topics, and then next to mental health workbooks published by psychologists on how to address grief with CBT, etc.    
  
So I find there's more ""health"" related books in general, even the scientifically-based ones, but because the self-help section exists and is fairly popular other marginally related books also get shelved there.",""

people were getting more into yoga, fitness, diet & exercise was being pushed on tv - richard simmons, jane fonda. 

this all makes people ripe for advertisers to target. 

cable tv came along with long form infomercials, late night tv home shopping & tony robbins et al flogging off sets of 200 cassette tapes to tell you how to achieve all your goals,  for small monthly payments, and pretty much everything came with the obligatory free set of steak knives, evangelical tv, including real kooky. stuff like gwen shamblin, talk shows such as donohue, sally jessie raphael, rikki lake, oprah, et al, breakfast tv started pushing more and more products at housewives to improve their lives, new age spirituality emerged commercially  - i remember a friend’s mum reading shirley maclaine’s book where she was going on about reincarnation, and that maclaine was touring the USA lecturing about her spiritual awakening, and being shocked that people would pay to go and see that. 

i think the stereotypical brits & other commonwealth countries took longer to get into the concept of  self examination or “navel-gazing” - it took much longer for the american cable tv type advertising to spread throughout other countries with smaller populations than the usa, plus the stereotypical British attitude of “stiff upper lip, dont make a fuss, suck it up and just get on with things, put the kettle on & have a cup of tea”

the us has more of a history of the travelling snake oils salesman, the culture of adverting in the us tended to much more showy & flamboyant, the population was much greater, and economically the us was stronger, which gave more people more free time & discretionary spending money to explore self improvement - as the self improvement industry was emerging in the usa, the uk had thatcher, the falklands war, mines being shut down, and poll tax. the usa  was churning out tv shows such as dallas & dynasty, while the uk was watching was watching eastenders & coronation street.",""

The exploitative and toxic form a lot of self-help literature takes is a different matter though.

Obviously this sentiment really resonates with people. I guess the idea that higher powers are intentionally shifting blame and responsibility to individuals is appealing. But the reality is individualism and self-determination has always been a part of the US identity, even before it was emphasized in politics in the late 20th century. It was a large part of the US's rise to power, and has had huge positive impact on cultural movements adressing gender equality, racial injustice, and LGBTQ rights. To deny the inherent value of self-improvement and individualism, and frame it as purely a societal deflection mechanism, fails to see the bigger picture.","lpknl1n"

The way the US handled the pandemic is wildly exemplar of this and there was a massive glut of self-help content which proliferated in a time the government was failing its people on an unprecedented scale.

Self-help books may feel uplifting in the same way being handed a compliment can be uplifting when you are feeling unattractive.

I think a lot of people will avoid acknowledging their guilt because they refuse to engage with their shame of being guilty. But I don't think that makes shame a culprit. I think it indicates too heavy of a prioritization on perception (how we need others to see us) rather than reality (how we actually impact the world around us.) That's an issue of ego and a lack of valuing experiences of the Other. Which does show you where you need to do work, but not in a way people like.

In the same way most therapy speak gets washed out and emptied of its nuance and meaning as it reaches the masses, but is still very much applied by the masses (see ""boundaries""), I think a lot of the same happened with shame.

I don't think we should be eradicating shame, in the same way I don't think we should be eradicating anger. It is a tool to work with in selective ways. And when improperly used... has devastating consequences.

I just think the way it came about (and became really popular in white feminist spaces) armed more people who seek to use the lesson in bad faith than it did help people who overly shame themselves and are stuck in that shame cycle, all at a time when we really really needed people to learn how to hold discomfort and the complexity of behavior and consequence.","lplh8eh"

It feels normal to be overweight. 

I used to live in the south, and where I lived, unhealthy behaviors were common.  I moved away to a more affluent area, and though my circumstances hadn't changed, my behaviors did.

Every day I saw joggers, cyclists, people walking with their children after dinner every evening. If I went to a potluck party, it wasn't all casseroles and macaroni and cheese, but fresh, vibrant food.  A lot of those behaviors I was observing certainly had a lot to do with class, but it didn't explain why my behaviors changed.

"lpo9cdj","DripRoast","2024-09-30 16:46:29 UTC","That's not really the point. You're retroactively applying the self-help genre to something that wasn't written with that in mind. 

The notion that some random individual is going to have access to a copy of the bible that they can read and understand is a very recent development in the grander scheme of things. It wasn't until the protestant reformation in Europe for example that you started seeing lots of bibles in the vernacular for example.

The bible was just plain old help lol. This information was disseminated by religious institutions who read and interpreted it for you.","lpo69bl"

That says nothing about meaning people ""believe frozen minimum wages and economic inequality is justified"", just that the problems are waaaaaaay above the scope of personal improvement.

But we're expected to ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps"" rather than address the societal issues themselves; reading 1000 self-help books won't do anything about stagnant wages and income inequality.

Corporate interests want people to be looking at individuals rather than the system, because then they wouldn't profit as much. We're down here fighting amongst ourselves, while they're raking it in.","lplnyl2"
