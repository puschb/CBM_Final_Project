Pride and Prejudice is an all time favorite, but to really consider the lack of choice for women of that era is frightening. The desperation and fear Mrs Bennet had about what would happen to them when Mr Bennet died is played for laughs, but it was very real. Women were completely dependant on men. The only job they could've filled would be if they could find a position as a governess, and then you would be looked down on. Not really a servant, but definitely not family. Very lonely life.  If you were attractive and the man of the house wanted you, they could throw you out without a reference if you refused their advances. 

I could go on about any period in history, of course. And any social/ financial class.

If it would be a Holideck experience the following would be my pick:

**Anne of Green Gables**

Though I'd like the people to look like the cast of the Megan Fellows movies. I know you said books. But I saw the first movie before I read the series, so that's who I picture when I read the books.

**Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry**

This is where the Holideck version would need to come into play cause...I'm white, and if it was really the Jim Crow Segregated South I wouldn't be able to hang out with the Logan family which is what I'd want to do. 

**Star Trek Books** (You had to see this coming) 

      *TOS: Uhura's Song* by Janey Kagan is my favorite book from this era of Trek. I just don't want to contact the illness that's in this book. 

     *TNG: Reunion or Q-in-law* both by Peter David. The first one cause it has a lot of Picard history. The 2nd one because Q meets his match with Lwaxana Troi and it's funny. 

     *DS9: The Lives of Dax* I really enjoyed most of the anthology...minus Joran (if you know you know). 

**Doctor Who**

I haven't found a book I'd like to visit yet, but I'd love to visit this universe and it would have to be a multi-Doctor arch.
