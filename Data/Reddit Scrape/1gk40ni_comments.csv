"lvi9ddd","MikeRocksTheBoat","2024-11-05 11:40:21 UTC","I took a class in college called, ""Poetry for the People"" and this was a technique that came up frequently. Specific brands usually ground the writing in a certain time or place, while also adding a recognizable connection for the people reading, all while not specifically spelling out those things specifically. 

You didn't drink a soda, you refreshed yourself with a Diet Pepsi with condensation still gathering on the bottle. You didn't smoke a cigarette, you let the bitter burn of an unfiltered Newport sear your throat. Etc. Etc.


A lot of it seemed really forced to me, honestly, and I discovered that I don't really enjoy writing that goes overboard with the real product references like that. Probably because my brain immediately connects it to a pretty basic thing I learned in school and it feels a little contrived.",""
"lviemd5","Psittacula2","2024-11-05 12:22:53 UTC","It has been ages since I read Murakami, but as opposed to thinking I was reading about brands specifically, the effect I always felt from reading his books was that this description using specific brands was all about the characters living in a very, very “precise”, or considered way: Those “slacks” were a specific brand of trousers which matches the t-shirt underneath the suit jacket, for example. His economy and simple use of language contrasts with the characters being quite deliberate, giving the reader an idea of their inner world via their choices and “deliberateness”. Apply this to the brands and features of their environment around them at the time and they are also a product of that specific environment also.

Both Raymond Candler and Scott Fitzgerald style of writers are amongst his favourite in English. Simple language interspersed with brands seems a likely choice.",""

"lvit5zz","Ucinorn","2024-11-05 13:57:30 UTC","Murakami is arguably a magic realist writer, in the sense that his characters accept and interact with supernatural elements without a care. He tends to set the reader up for those sections by hyper-focusing on the consumerist lifestyle of his characters and their routines. 

By really drumming on the boring, day to day parts of life like band names, cooking and commuting, the really weird things that happen really pop off the page. It makes these things surprising to the reader, even if the characters are not fussed by them. It's part of why he's so well liked, but he can be polarising because some people don't have the patience for that. Also, he's a misogynist and it really comes through in his work.",""

"lvicuoa","LightSardine","2024-11-05 12:09:14 UTC","While I think it's possible that identifying brands may be used to highlight consumerism, I don't think it's the primary intention. We live in a consumerist culture, it's the water around us. The level of brand name dropping is just high enough where we question if there was sponsorship, it would need to be much higher and way more over used, to the point of almost parody, for me to think it's a comment. 

Rather, I would say it's either used to give ""flavor"" or minor characterization to characters or locations, it attempts to ""ground"" the setting like others have said, or what I think is most likely, just a writing style.

1. Flavor. - Prefered brands do give additional info about characters without it having or be spelled out. Economic background, personality, etc can be inferred by the brands a person uses or prefers.

2. Grounding. Like others have said, may just be a way to link it to a specific place and time.

3. Writing style. Honestly... I feel like this is the most likely reason. My feel when reading murakami is his style tends to hyper detail scenes, without leaving much to the imagination. Not to say the prose is purple, but scenes are written precisely, but not ""concisely"".

When I read Murakami it felt like he ejnoys western culture so he injected it in his novel (Wind up Bird Chronicle), not just brands, but also music. The specific mentions do ground the otherwise surreal narrative, but it's interesting that they are western products instead of their Japanese coutnerparts. That being said, there certainly are american(a) inspired Japanese sub-cultures and while Japan has its own whiskeys, cigars, rock and roll and so on, western brands are also huge there. So I don't want to write it off *just* as a facination with the West.  

Now, I don't know the effect this has to a Japanese audience, but as a westerner myself it was not that plesant. The protagonist of AWUBC came out a bit pretentious if anything. I still remeber that the book opens with him making pasta while listening to opera. I remeber him recognizing specific jazz soundtracks form 50s movies. I remeber him smoking brand cigars and sipping whiskey.

Absolutely nothing in that movie feels real at all because it's so poorly acted and the writing is utter nonsense. Even though it was largely filmed on Disney property and in the parks, it feels so fake because no one gives a reasonable performance. The best actor in the film was probably the nurse who is in one scene, but even that scene is ruined because she starts crying at the end of it, overselling the point entirely. And the point is actually... nothing. 


There is no point. Nothing goes anywhere. It's all psuedo-intellectualism, just a poorly thought out attempt to criticize Disney, who are *ripe* for criticism btw, but it fails to do anything meaningful at all. It attempts to paint a sinister edge over everything Disney but is so clumsy in its messaging that nothing means anything.


What was the point of the scene where the guy is tied up in that sciencey set? What exactly are they doing to him? Why are all the scientists robots? How does any of that tie into the cat flu storyline? How do the teenage girls the main character stalks tie into any of this? How does the supremely over-acting former princess actress witch tie into any of it? It's all just random supposedly sinister bullshit that doesn't mean anything.


And uh, on topic... Yeah Murakami does seem to mention brands a lot, but in regards to him I think you nailed it. It grounds the stories somewhat in the real world. The constant mention is a very quiet critique, about how ubiquitous these brands are in everyday life. He isn't shouting about it, just pointing it out. The very fact that mentioning brands grounds the stories is in itself pointing out how much modern society revolves around those brands.

But on a meta level I also dislike it, because I feel like the concept of a horror movie filmed in the Disney parks could have been a home run. But instead it was just a jumbled mess. So a missed opportunity, and in a way I feel like it kinda blew it for anyone else to want to try.

If you enjoy it though, more power to you. Sorry to totally derail the topic lmao.","lvi6wt2"

"lvi7ahm","vangoghtohell","2024-11-05 11:21:25 UTC"," Agreed, as a former smoker. There’s a clear difference between ‘she smoked a Marlboro red’ and ‘she smoked a Gauloise’ to me, and it helps ground it in reality, since Marlboro is well recognized by just about anyone. ","lvi6in0"
"lviierz","Imaginary-Look-4280","2024-11-05 12:50:09 UTC","This. The brand of cigarette you smoked was definitely tied to image. The brand of anything you use is often tied to the image you have of yourself, whether it's conscious or not. In the early 00s I worked in a cafe, not the minimalist Starbucks style they've all morphed into now but the sort where all the furniture is mismatched, we were open til midnight, had cheap coffee and decent food, and the customers ranged from grad students studying all day (pre Wifi! Zero computers, phones, etc) to working adults in for lunch to the punks and hippies sitting outside chain smoking all night.  Anyways, most of us staff smoked and it was all Camel Lights, Parliaments, American Spirits or hand rolled filterless.","lvi6in0"

"lvienzj","Silvery30","2024-11-05 12:23:14 UTC","It's been a while since I watched that movie so I don't remember a lot of plot points. The ending may have been a daydream, Arronovsky's ""The Whale"" has a similar ending where after an hour of non-stop misery everything suddenly fixes itself shortly before the protagonist dies which leads many people to believe it's a daydream. Honestly, I have a weird way of enjoying movies, sometimes a movie can have an ambiguous or even bad plot but I can still appreciate it the way I would appreciate a painting. I don't get the plot of many David Lynch and Tarkovsky films but they kept me hooked with their atmosphere/visuals alone (hell, I don't get the plot of many Murakami books but I still love his distinct style/aesthetic). I thought the protagonist was funny in a dorky/campy Leon Kennedy sort of way. When he lost Sarah, he looked genuinely distressed, no complaints about the acting there. I liked small details like him getting tazed in the groin and his pelvis becoming visible in a cartoonish disney-like way. I agree it's messy, but it's a kind of creative, self-completing mess.","lvi9exs"

"lvoxa7k","ourstobuild","2024-11-06 11:46:06 UTC","I definitely agree with the grounding it in reality. As a non-smoker I wouldn't have made the connection of Marlboro being a ""men's brand"", but someone smoking a cigarette sounds a lot more generic for sure. If you compare the two, I feel ""cigarette"" kinda feels like you're reading a fictional story, whereas ""Marlboro"" feels like you're reading a story that might have happened in reality.","lvi7ahm"

If I read ""she smoked a Pall Mall Light 100"", I don't even need a visual description of the woman in question. I can already see her.","lvi7ahm"
