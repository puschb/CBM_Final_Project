I read one book that used ""sardonic/ally"" frequently (every 5 or 6 pages). I had to look it up at the time and was quite annoyed that the author didn't use a thesaurus because that rather obscure word (I've never heard anyone say it) can be said a number of other ways and at least keep the ""scornful derision"" interesting. Which leads me to the general annoyance of authors using obscure words when there are perfectly understandable and much more common alternatives. It makes the author seem annoyingly pretentious and absolutely pulls me out of the story.

The other thing that bothers me is when an book will have a character semi-frequently spout whole sentences in another language, usually French, and give no clue what was said. The person they're talking will reply with something like ""yes, you're right"" or ""don't be that way"". Urm. (I took German in highschool, lol) Did they say something important? I don't know. After that's happened the third time, I don't want to read the book anymore.

Christopher Fowler: Multiple things.  Biggest example - in the opening of one book he forgets which character he killed off in the previous book, remembers, then forgets again a page later.  I also suspect he has never met a woman before given charactisation and wardrobe choice (at one point a uniformed police officer is described as routinely wearing a steel boned corset under a stab proof vest!)

Rowling: all of those issues others have mentioned plus characters whose first and second names begin with the same letter.  Also use of stereotypical names for characters from non-white ethnic groups.  

Dan Brown: Randomly including the colour of objects amongst many other things.

Patricia Cornwell: No two characters age at the same rate - at one point the lead character's niece ages ten years in ten months, in another she ages 5 years in one year - during the same amount of time the lead character has aged less than 4 years.  [The likely explanation is multiple ghost writers ]

Many acquire ridiculously over the top skill sets in small periods of time.  

Early Ian Rankin (caveat: I like his work, this is just one annoying element): Rebus is a former soldier and noted as having gone through SAS selection yet goes on ah expedition to a remote Scottish island in a suit and dress shoes.

The dark lord focused intently on the dim light and the book in front of him. Runes flowed from the pages, bleeding into his skin as he whispered the incantation under his breath. It wouldn't be long, he told himself, before the secrets of the grimoire were his. At least, he hoped it wouldn't be. His eyelids were drooping, and he could feel his feet going numb from the less than comfortable ritual position. 

The candle flame flickered. The dark lord heard a whistling noise by his right ear, and just a split second later came a cold, creamy splat into the side of his face. He yelped, falling awkwardly sideways onto his elbow as cream cheese filling and buttery biscuit crumbs slopped down his robes. The dark lord brought a hand to his face and wiped sticky caramel sauce out of his eyes, blinking furiously as he turned back to the ritual.

It had failed. The candle wick was extinguished, and the grimoire sat dull and lifeless, its runes nothing more than mundane ink scribbles. A single decorative fruit sat lopsided on the page, along with a spattering of cream.

From the side of the room, the dark lord heard voices.

""Oh my GOD, why did you throw the cheesecake at him?""
""From that look you gave me, I thought you wanted me to!""
""I WANTED YOU TO GO AND GET REINFORCEMENTS!""
There was a pause.
""Oh. Well...shit.""
""Let's just get out of here, come on!""

There was the sound of feet scrambling away, and through his cheesecake-blurred vision the dark lord could just make out two figures running to the door. He was too dazed to run after them.

Looking dejectedly at his now useless ritual setup, he scooped a little cheesecake from his robe and tasted it. At the very least, it was delicious.","lwkd8a0"

There's a lot that can be said through someone's expressions and I feel like that's all an author is trying to do by writing this way, without specifically telling you that that character feels that way. More often than not you're viewing someone from another person's perspective and them reading someone's face/body language is the only way to convey what that person is going through.

I get a repeat of words if the author wants to emphasize a particular aur for the chapter or the entire book.

At the beginning of each chapter, there is an excerpt from a fictional scientific book written by one of the characters. Many of them contain a part in which the author states ""We know"" followed by some octopus facts, or some octopus facts followed by ""We know this.""

First, it would be a very unnatural way for a real non-fiction book about a scientific subject to be written, constantly telling the reader that ""we"" already know something.

The other thing is that all of the octopus facts are just sections from Other Minds by Peter Godfrey-Smith (a real non-fiction book about octopuses) that have been paraphrased.

That's another thing I hate, too, when one author starts an obvious trend and others in the same genre jump on board. It makes me feel like I'm reading a paint-by-numbers story instead of an original work.

Related: reviews or blurbs that list the tropes you can find in the novel, e.g. In this book, you can expect: enemies to lovers, forced proximity, slow burn, one bed...etc. etc. I get WHY people do that, and I get that it helps some readers who really are looking for tropes in genres that tend to be trope-heavy, but it really puts me off the book and makes it feel too formulaic for me. I don't want to read someone's mix-and-match trope concoction; I want to read someone's interesting story.

Obviously tropes/trends/language/genre commonalities exist and always have, but there's a difference between being influenced by the history of a certain genre and writing a book that feels like you spun a wheel a few times and pasted together something out of the six tropes/settings/plot lines that turned up.","lwk2n86"

Those words should be understood as mere equivalents of alien terms-that is, a conventional set of equivalents of the same sort that a writer of novels uses when he has foreign characters speaking with each other in their own language but nevertheless transcribes their words in the language of the reader. So when the people of Kalgash speak of ""miles,"" or ""hands,"" or ""cars,"" or ""computers,"" they mean their own units of distance, their own grasping-organs, their own ground-transportation devices, their own information-processing machines, etc.
> 
> The computers used on Kalgash are not necessarily compatible with the ones used in New York or London or Stockholm, and the ""mile"" that we use in this book is not necessarily the American unit of 5,280 feet. But it seemed simpler and more desirable to use these familiar terms in describing events on this wholly alien world than it would have been to invent a long series of wholly Kalgashian terms. In other words, we could have told you that one of our characters paused to strap on his quonglishes before setting out on a walk of seven vorks along the main gleebish of his native znoob, and everything might have seemed ever so much more thoroughly alien. But it would also have been ever so much more difficult to make sense out of what we were saying, and that did not seem useful.
> 
> The essence of this story doesn't lie in the quantity of bizarre terms we might have invented; it lies, rather, in the reaction of a group of people somewhat like ourselves, living on a world that is somewhat like ours in all but one highly significant detail, as they react to a challenging situation that is completely different from anything the people of Earth have ever had to deal with. Under the circumstances, it seemed to us better to tell you that someone put on his hiking boots before setting out on a seven-mile walk than to clutter the book with quonglishes, vorks, and gleebishes. If you prefer, you can imagine that the text reads ""vorks"" wherever it says ""miles,"" ""gliizbiiz"" wherever it says ""hours,"" and ""sleshtraps"" where it says ""eyes."" Or you can make up your own terms. Vorks or miles, it will make no difference when the Stars come out.

>I do get really annoyed when authors from England forget their version of English is not the only one

Do you see the irony in complaining that writers from other countries don't cater to *your* version of English? How about broadening those horizons Walter?

>include words no one else knows

No, Walter, these are words that *you* don't know. Other people are fine. Nothing wrong with using a dictionary either, that's how we all learn.

>Some Australian authors do this too - they use slang from other parts of the country that don't exist where I live.

Yes, Walter, other countries exist and guess what, ""where you live"" is not the centre of the universe for them. 

>Penury"" from the Galbraith books is one example - it appears at least once in the first three books

At least once ü§£. Well, you certainly learnt a new word thanks to her which you still remember to this day. Perhaps you should thank her.

"lwn5q4s","sofbunny","2024-11-11 21:07:17 UTC","It‚Äôs true there isnt a clear line of what language should be used to sound realistic because in a fantasy world they would not be speaking English, and if this was a medieval world that was related to our world but just magical, then they‚Äôd probably be speaking some earlier version of English, so in some sense literally every piece of dialogue is unrealistic.¬†

The way I think about it in my head is that the author has simply translated this story from it‚Äôs original language, meaning that we are going to hear everything in modern english, but none of our modern specific idioms and phrases.¬†

Theres plenty of language that we use every day that would make sense in an archaic setting, but current trendy shit like ‚Äúunhinged‚Äù and ‚Äútoxic men‚Äù as people mentioned earlier, and slang that screams a specific time or place that ISNT the main setting of the book ‚Äî pulls me immediately out of a book. And i bet that in some scenarios, even a phrase like ‚Äúanon forthwith‚Äù could feel like an anachronism if the setting is meant to be archaic but utterly foreign to england, like a different planet, say.

I have a lot to say about how people talk in fantasy novels cuz IMO the way people talk is one of the most profoundly culturally reflective things that people do. When authors really go all in on dialects and language I get really excited. It‚Äôs just incredibly hard because it also has to be legible.¬†","lwl0oci"

Heinlein always had a wise old man who was treating the women like his own breeding stock, so once I realized that was him I never read anything else by him. All the Alexander Kent and Douglas Reeman books I read as a kid are ""Small action, love interest, major action, return to love interest"". Anything that proselytizes for religion of any sort.

what do you mean?


Also ifk why peolle get upset about having young charaters embark on herpic adventures.
Also, irony is, historically we did have young soldiers/spies who were trained as young as 14 to 19.


What is overdome is the middle aged retiree hero goimg back to save the for the umpteebth time and theyrr raging drunks amd sailormouths.


Or having awkward mediocre wisecracking adults who are the main leads as the foil to ""precocious young characters"".
I feel those stories sre just reverse ageism to justify mediocrity in adulthood.




>13 going on 30
wdym?
Like precocious teen girls trying to break into the adult world?
My pet peeve is the ""30 going on 13"", you know the midlife crisis type¬† ehavior.


>All the Alexander Kent and Douglas Reeman books I read as a kid are ""Small action, love interest, major action, return to love interest"".¬†


Unfortunately alot of action adventure movies seem to be more ""boy meets girl"" but with gruff men falling in love with some female passerby that doesnt have any distinguishable personality beyond some ""shy/passive dame catches the eye of the main character.""
I especially hate the chivalric small talk and attack dog maneuvers¬† said male leads will do for her.
Very annoying.




>Anything that proselytizes for religion of any sort. Lazy writing. There's an author that basically parallels military history in whatever world he 'creates'. That seems lazy, and is very predictable.


those guys usually watched too much war movies but did little reading about history beyond ""le Romans and World War 2 Europe"". Also alot of religion mentioned in secular writng is often used for reactionary purposes.


> Obvious MAGA sympathies will get a book returned. Kid death porn, like Battle Royale, and Heinlein did that a long time ago too.¬†


Yea those kind of books usually feature alot of bullying and shrug it off like its nothing.
I just hate how society thinks childhood bullying is just ""harmless kid fun"".




>Any author that has a predictable progression or set of characters. Heinlein always had a wise old man who was treating the women like his own breeding stock, so once I realized that was him I never read anything else by him.

Essentially it comes down to the question ""is this the best way to communicate this information?"" which is itself just a subset of the writing maxim ""show, don't tell"". 

""Dumbly"" doesn't pass that test because you are just telling us a person is acting dumb, not showing it. Something like ""apologetically"" works because it is one of the few ways to describe that particular tone and because you are still hinting at a person's feelings and tone but not directly telling about it.

"lwlc2zw","CrosstheBreeze2002","2024-11-11 15:31:05 UTC","A perfect example would be Ursula K. Le Guin's *A Wizard of Earthsea*. It's one of several phenomenal novels with plot points very similar to those Rowling would later adopt, and which she has consistently denied that she ever read‚Äîin fact, Rowling has always had a deeply dismissive attitude towards fantasy writing and YA writing pre-dating hers.

But anyhow: Le Guin is an absolutely legendary author, whose novels are imbued with a deep and heartfelt moral imagination. Her prose is... poised. It's a clich√©d word, but it points to a certain control: words, in Le Guin's world, are not easy things, barren of effect and consequence. They are weighty; they hold a charge. This has a double meaning: her prose is deeply physical; words are balanced in sentences; their sounds, their materiality, are considered and arranged with a deft, and sometimes playful, hand. But Le Guin is a deeply serious writer, even when she's playful, and the moral charge, the importance, the history of words weigh just as much as their sounds. She doesn't write something unless she knows what it means. Her language does not have the transparent, throwaway quality Rowling's does, a tool employed as needed to produce her vile world. In Le Guin, language is taken seriously as the thing that *produces* worlds and ideas.

Alan Garner's *The Owl Service* and *Red Shift* are two more incredible examples. These are often treated as though they're *not* kids' books (even if they're written for a slightly older audience than *HP*)‚Äîthere *is* an element of difficulty to them; they're structurally ambitious, and engage on a truly profound level with the history of Britain, with mythology, and with the realities of childhood. But I maintain that they represent an important era of children's writing, an era before the condescension (to be frank) of Rowling.

Garner's prose is fascinating, and actually quite different from one book to the next, I think. It's often quite modernist, without ever being hard to follow. His dialogue is astounding actually; despite his novels being written from the 70s onwards, it doesn't feel dated; it feels crisp, fresh, and real. His prose is mucky and grounded; his novels are always grounded in a grubby reality, no matter how fantastic they get, and his prose is not afraid to tarry with such grubbiness, such mundanity. He takes risks, and isn't afraid to be a little impressionist, to not quite spell things out‚Äîkids are far smarter than we give them credit for, and if we think they're often not up for understanding difficult books, it's because they never have to try. Rowling is a spoon-feeder‚Äîit's not on purpose, and not even because her prose is poor, but because she has a preconceived world in her head and her only interest is in transferring it as fully-formed as possible into the head of her reader. Hence her constant authorial intervention, her ridiculous ret-cons, and her clunky, unimaginative prose. Garner and Le Guin produce incredible worlds, but what they are concerned with producing, first and foremost, are *novels*. Their prose is not just functional, a means of transference, but an integral part *of* their worlds.

Anyway, I'll give you a couple more: Lucy Boston's *The Children of Green Knowe* is even older, but really quite magical; perhaps closer in reading age to *HP*. Susan Cooper's *The Dark is Rising* is wonderful, a little darker than the others mentioned, although I've not read it for many years, so I can't recall whether its audience is older than that of *HP*.","lwl56eh"

"lwx4j5j","Lost_Ninja","2024-11-13 14:20:54 UTC","Maturity IRL and Maturity in fiction is different though.

You're trying in books to create a believable character: describing how someone behaves, giving them actions to follow and then giving them an arbitrary age that conflicts with the two, makes the character seem shallow or unrealistic. My point was that the arbitrary age is often unrealistic given the other two and often seems to have been added/changed (perhaps in editing) to make the character palatable to current audiences.

We all know that mid teens (14-17 year olds) have sex, drink and do things that are not considered socially acceptable IRL, and when you write a character that would generally fall within that age range and a believable setting like high school. But then give them an age that isn't in keeping with the actions or setting. Some authors do it the other way they give the morals and actions of an adult to a child figure and the child isn't believable.

Unlike movies in books we have to give much more of our own experience to understand how someone works, if the information given directly contradicts what we know/hold to be true we'll have a far more difficult time seeing the character as anyone interesting or worthy of rooting for.

The birth range cohort (Boomers etc) I think is a broadly offensive term that should be no more used than using colour of someone's skin or their sexuality to try and generalise their behaviour. And since the widespread adoption of broadcast video media (1960s onward) and latterly with widespread internet usage, any actual similarities with people within your cohort are perceptual and not especially meaningful. And basing them around year or birth is frankly stupid, a child born as a boomer in 1964 isn't going to differ in experience or ethos much to a child born in 1965 as a Generation X (both could be classed as Generation Jones a semi-sub-generational cohort, similar to Xennials).
