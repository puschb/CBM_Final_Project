For me, that line of argument misses the underlying point. This isn't a risk matrix issue where you weigh up the likelihood of an event occuring vs severity of the impact to you as the individual if the event occurs (ie you have to replace the book). 

For me, this is an ***ethics*** issue. If it's my book that I own, then it's completely fair for me to decide the low risk of damage to my property is worth the pleasure I'll get from not having to wait to finish or re-borrow the book once I'm back. But if it's a library book, it's unethical for me to decide I can take unnecessary risks with something that isn't my property. So I wouldn't feel comfortable taking a library book with me on holiday. Even if I was at a really juicy bit. I wouldn't want to put the book down & leave it safe at home or return it, but I would still do it because that's what my personal sense of ethics would dictate as the best choice. I don't think someone who makes the opposite choice is an unethical monster, we just have different values.",""

Libraries have to buy books. And when you damage them, you're not going to pay $10, you're probably going to pay the cost of the book. That is the point of my comment.
