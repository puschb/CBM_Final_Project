"ltwlalc","Sad-Difficulty2303","2024-10-26 20:26:57 UTC","A lifetime of reading has taught me to switch to a non-fiction book and I highly recommend it before the next novel. Not only does it keep me reading good non-fiction which id normally not rush to do; but it serves as a palate cleanser between two fictional worlds.¬†

I only break this self imposed rule due to other weird self imposed rules - like only reading ¬†horror novels during October.¬†

Just read this back and it sounds a bit and strict and inflexible but it works for me, and without it I‚Äôd probably have missed out on so much life changing philosophy and nature writing¬†",""

"ltxirep","ChaoticFrugal","2024-10-26 23:44:24 UTC","You could even stick with Barbara Kingsolver and read ""Animal Vegetable Miracle""! It's her non-fiction about her experiment only eating locally produced food for a year. I loved it! (And then you should consider Demon Copperhead next. It is absolutely as epic as The Poisonwood Bible. Those two books are the reason Kingsolver is in my permanent top 3 authors.)","ltwqfwe"
"ltxf18p","CautiousMoment","2024-10-26 23:21:05 UTC","I do this too, and my go-to is anything by David Sedaris. He writes narrative essays about his life, so it still feels like a story. Plus, once you read enough of his work, his family members and partner start to feel like familiar characters.","ltwqfwe"
"ltwwwb4","Sad-Difficulty2303","2024-10-26 21:30:18 UTC","I suppose non-fiction is even more subjective than fiction but just had a wander round my shelves (thanks for an excuse to do this) and these are some of my personal favourites over the last few years (whilst trying to exclude the really famous ones)¬†¬†

¬†Perhaps life changing is a stretch but all have really stayed with me for very different reasons and made the gap between novels less painful.¬†¬†

¬†Leviathan, or The Whale by Philip Hoare¬†
Shark drunk by Morten Stroksnes Outpost by Dan Richards¬†¬†
Consolations of the forest by Sylvan Tesson¬†
¬†A paradise built in hell by Rebecca Solnit¬†
¬†The happiest man in the world by Alec Wilkinson¬†

I don't think I'll ever forget it.  I want to read it again at some point but not for a long while. And yes it's heartbreaking. You get angry, you just get bereft when reading it but it does it stays with you and it is so good. And I have to admit after reading it it's taken me a long time to read another book. I just was so emotionally invested in that book. And like some others in this thread I've started a nonfiction book. Lol. Thanks for the info on a Prayer for Owen Meany.
