What Han Kang said is probably true to a certain extent, that she feels a deep empathy and sorrow for those victims of war, but I don't think she said she ""would not celebrate because of that"". In another interview, she said she ""would keep her excitement to herself"". She does enjoy and she is celebrating. The point is, she would not hold a large press conference for that -- because she'll get to talk at Nobel prize award ceremony anyways.

So, is there any particular reason she would want to avoid a large press conference? This is purely my imagination, but: If you have noticed, Korean press isn't that respecting towards interviewee. There's a nonnegligible chance she'd get some nasty questions now she's a Nobel laureate.

The Sudan is currently home to the largest displaced population in the world - over 8 million displaced - along with the largest displaced population of children. Approximately 25 million people don't have enough food, and almost a million children under the age of 5 are at risk of dying from malnutrition.

The phone or laptop you're using to type this has a battery that was made with child slave labor in the Congo. No matter how clean the supply chain is supposed to be, somewhere a child was likely buried alive in an illegal cobalt mine so we can all have longer lasting batteries.

The Tigray War killed a mind-numbing number of people. This is not some old news. From just 2020-2022, the estimates are usually around 200,000 to 800,000 deaths, with more than half of them likely civilians. The other atrocities (regular rapes, etc) are horrific.

I try to learn about global conflicts, and I still consider myself badly uninformed. I don't really understand the ethnic groups in Ethiopia and Eritrea, or military factions in Sudan, or whatever. I'm aware most of the world's suffering probably escapes my notice, despite my efforts.

While this is absolutely true, I do feel it's worth noting that these places are all already sanctioned heavily by western governments. So a big reason we see other issues ""elevated"" in media and such is because for people who care about them there's a perceived lack of action/sanctions by the political activist's own government.  Whether that's Pro-Hong Kong/Uyghur anti-China, Pro-Palestine Anti-Israel, etc.

I search out effective ways to help, read about altruism, make sure my donations come from statistics and math and have the highest chance of doing good, not from the place of emotions, and then move on. There's enough tragedy in my own life and community.

And having a colder, more rational approach also creates higher chances of helping in more effective but less ""popular"" places.

The USA has supplied around $140 billion in money and weapons to Ukraine. I can't think of much more the USA could do other than send American troops to fight Russians directly, yet the situation still dominates our news.

I would prefer if the conflicts elevated were the ones where people felt their government wasn't doing enough - just not sure that's the case. I feel it's more that they cover whatever they think will get clicks, and Russia or Israel generates more clicks than Africa.

I said it's frustrating when people ONLY mention whatever the news tells them is a tragedy, *and act like these are singularly momentous situations*. I've heard many people say the situation in Gaza is unlike anything that has happened since WWII. Which seems to dismiss a lot of suffering and elevate one horrible situation.

Others in the thread mentioned - and it's exactly the problem you mentioned. It IS never ending. If you won't celebrate while 'a war' is going on, then you can never celebrate. War and suffering is constant.

Meanwhile, Myanmar is a very populous country of over 50 million sandwiched between India and China, two Asian heavyweights that have a lite version of the Cold War going on. Both countries have a heavy stake in Myanmar, as does Bangladesh, which has seen spillover fighting on top of dealing with Rohingya refugees, and Thailand, which has also been absorbing¬† refugees as well.

While yes, Russia has been heavily sanctioned, it's still relevant every week when there's discussions over whether to send **more weapons** or let Ukraine used the provided weapons to attack Russia directly (attack military bases ***in Russia***\\*\\*)\\*\\*.

I'm not going to pretend to be as aware of the situation in the African countries you've referred to - I fully agree that the media barely discusses them, so only those who go out of their way to find information will have even a passable understanding -  but I'm not aware of Ukraine equivalents who are being actively supported through guns/missiles/etc.

The Ukraine war is relevant simply because while other countries aren't sending troops, they *are* sending military supplies. While everywhere else it's mainly food/water/medicine that is provided as aid, which isn't as controversial / doesn't make governments directly involved in the fighting.

-------------------------------------

I guess as a TL;DR, I ask as you seem more aware than I am of these wars, is there a clear ""push"" which we should be making for governments to act differently than they currently are? Are there groups we should be supporting through missiles and guns like we do Ukraine? Or with sanctions already applied, is there no next step to be taken as an outside nation other than sending in military troops to try and forcibly change the situation?

There is a lot to unpack here. Total number isn't a particularly useful metric. There are 8 billion people on the planet today. Which is about x10 the population of 300 years ago at the height of colonial slavery. 

There is also likely a significant amount of unintentional definition shifting when it comes to discussions of slavery. Most people in the West think of chattel slavery when they hear the term but that is only a small subset of the types of slavery. So when people hear ""40 million slaves today"" they are likely picturing 40 million chattel slaves but that is not accurate. 

When we look back historically there are significant groups that we don't traditionally categorize as slaves but would fit the modern definitions used by groups like the UN. The most obvious group would be serfs who made up a significant portion of Europe's population for centuries. During their era, they were legally distinct from slaves but they are slaves by modern definitions. In the 1850s there were over 20 million serfs living in Russia. At a time when the world population was 1/8th of what it is now, one country had half of modern world's slaves using current definitions. 

The world is objectively better than it was. The percentage of people living under some form of slavery is lower than it has ever been in history. And the total number of slaves is likely lower than most eras of history despite the much larger current population.

We still have a lot of work to do, but this weird defeatist attitude isn't helping anything. Recognizing that we have made progress can help motivate us to continue making progress.

I really care about standing by this because the alternative (that we see often) is that someone starts believing and loudly proclaiming that black is white simply because someone on the other side has found a way to turn white is white into some kind of supporting or deflection argument for their ideology (never mind that often they still have other fallacies that should be criticized in their thinking anyway).

Obviously ""there are wars everywhere"" is not a good way to deflect discussion of one specific war for the same reason, in fact. Just like with having fun, caring about one specific war is not something that you can't do as long as there is a bigger concern somewhere else. It's also why I think the whole ""why do people only care about certain wars!"" line is often a bit disingenuous. Western audiences caring more about Ukraine and Israel than some other conflicts? Well, color me surprised, it's almost as if we had more political, diplomatic, economic, and in some cases personal and even familial ties to those countries. As if we were both more impacted by their wars, *and* had more influence on them, and thus we tend to care more. I mean, obviously there can be cases where a certain war is kind of shushed because we *do* have influence on it (and it's of the bad kind), and should be brought up. But there are also cases where countries we know little about fight for things that we understand little about and any overexcited demands that ""something must be done!"" would only make matters worse. Accepting that other countries and peoples have agencies and aren't just subjects for us to uplift, push down, or police, means accepting that sometimes this happens too. Maybe we have diplomats who can help the situation and it'd be great if they did, but the average citizen likely has zero to contribute, and it's never going to become anything like a top 10 priority in voting anyway.","lrjbd4b"

But how and why are other causes able to grab international attention? Like others have pointed out, from a humanitarian standpoint the conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia actually dwarf Gaza; but they've no where near the international attention.

Why is that? 

The west is playing a role there (safekeeping of money, selling of arms, etc.) just as it is in the middle east but no major author is declining an award because of the RSF in Sudan.

That's very true. I guess I would like it if that's the reason it's in the news (because it's a tough decision). Maybe I'm cynical feeling like it's a newsroom watching clicks or what their advertisers and backers tell them to promote.

As for a clear push - I wouldn't say clear, because these conflicts are difficult to unravel. My own personal view is that the USA and West has been too aggressive trying to aggregate influence, worrying about Russia and China. We were successful, but also made Putin feel like a cornered rat as his influence waned. I feel like Ukraine was caught in that vise.

The USA sends money and aid all over - Egypt, Lebanon, Israel, Gaza, etc. I feel like we sometimes use other countries as pawns for power, with little concern for actual humanitarian costs. 

I would like to see more de-escalation and more negotiation promoted, even when the results are imperfect. I wish we had done that with Iraq and Afghanistan, and I worry what's coming with Iran.

However, saying ""end wars"" is like saying ""cure cancer."" There are many different types with many different causes. Fighting tobacco industry lowered the incidence of lung and throat cancer, but didn't do much for childhood leukemia.

Similarly, I haven't found one single or even several things I could do that would ""end wars,"" but for example, one cause of wars is scarcity of various resources. So I have focused some of my donations on vitamin A supplements for newborns in certain regions in Africa, then access to clean water in others, and clean cooking stoves that reduce lung diseases and infant mortality as they are particularly susceptible to smoke. 

Another thing I did is work on building information resources for understanding and lowering racism in Eastern Europe towards different peoples in Asia, as I believe seeing others as equal human beings should also lower the chances of being indifferent to them dying or losing their homes etc.

It's a complicated matter, for sure, but I am not alone. There are many people working on many different aspects of world problems which should lower incidences of wars breaking out.

I don't know if my approach is as effective as I hope it is, but in worst case scenario these things alone (preventing blindness with vit A, clean water, etc.) are very positive things all by themselves.

"lrnt3xy","Firelord_11","2024-10-13 02:17:11 UTC","It's certainly a very complex conflict, and I'm not sure I can do it full justice--I'm Bangladeshi, not Burmese--but I can break it down for you.

So starting with the obvious: in 2021, Myanmar's junta, the Tatmadaw, overthrew Aung Sun Suu Kyi's government, sparking mass protests among the pro-democracy crowd in Naypyidaw as well as violence in the far flung provinces of Myanmar where ethnic minorities, long oppressed by the government, decided to form militias. This is nothing new and, even under Suu Kyi, there was ethnic violence in Myanmar--most famously the Rohingya genocide (I'll get back to that in a bit). But what made things different this time is that, for all of the grievances ethnicities in Myanmar have towards each other, the Tatamadaw is the one common enemy they all have, the organization that began the conflict in Myanmar in the first place. Their tactics for putting down rebellions are extremely brutal--bombing hospitals and schools, burning down villages, shooting children, rape, beheadings, and even allegations of chemical warfare. And so, some time in 2023, all these militias, along with the government-in-exile, decided to form a united front and have been successful so far, coordinating movements and attacks to almost completely take control of the border regions through which Myanmar's trade runs. You can imagine this looks very bad for the Tatmadaw, which has had to resort to a mandatory military draft to address desertions and falling morale among troops. And yet, at the same time, the anti-junta forces have struggled to make headway into the major cities in the center of Myanmar--leaving the war at an impasse, with neither side gaining much ground in recent months.

China has historically been supportive of the junta, which is not surprising given China's own authoritarianism; they've been a major weapon supplier to the junta during the conflict. And yet, even so, there are signs the support may be wavering--as violence surges along China's border regions, so has crime and trafficking of the Chinese expats living in the area, none of which are desirable to Beijing. 

Meanwhile, India has its own trade ties with Myanmar which blossomed during the democratic period, and has managed several major infrastructure projects throughout the country--and so, while India has generally not been pleased with the junta, it has continued to carry on business as usual also. And yet, India's role may also be changing--recently, they invited [anti-junta forces to a conference](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/india-extends-unprecedented-invite-myanmars-anti-junta-forces-sources-say-2024-09-23/), which is huge and may signal that they are becoming more bold in showing their opposition to the junta. 

Finally, Bangladesh. The Rohingya genocide and the flight of the Rohingya to Bangladesh is pretty well known. Bangladesh took a similar stance to India in the aftermath of the coup, being less cordial with the junta than they were with Suu Kyi's government but still willing to cooperate--especially because a major goal of Bangladesh is to repatriate the Rohingya, which requires diplomacy with the junta. Obviously though, repatriating the Rohingya is a terrible idea, and in the meantime, not only have more Rohingya (and other) refugees crossed the border into Bangladesh, the border regions have seen enormous fighting. Mortar shells from fighting in Myanmar's Rakhine state have killed 2 civilians in Bangladesh so far. And at the same time, [several hundred Myanmar military personnel](https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/338753/tension-at-border-fear-grips-residents-in) have attempted to flee into Bangladesh as well. For sure, the border regions are less populated and the vast majority of Bangladeshis are nowhere near the fighting, but it is certainly a big headache for the current government of Bangladesh to address.

I'm not going to talk about Thailand, because I am less knowledgeable about them. But the point is, this is a huge war with high stakes for many countries. Earlier I mentioned the war was at an impasse--either China or India openly collaborating with anti-junta forces could be huge and change the tide of the war, so that's something to watch out for. Even if the anti-junta forces win, there's no telling what will happen--will the militias lay down their arms and join in a pluralistic democracy? Or will they continue fighting and declare their own nations, as some of them already have? 

And as for Suu Kyi? No one knows where she is or if she's ever going to return to power. It's hard to reconcile the Suu Kyi who fought for democracy with the Suu Kyi who presided over state-sanctioned genocide. But I will say this--even during Suu Kyi's time in power, the junta had a huge presence in the government and had the system rigged against her such that she could never be Prime Minister. I think Suu Kyi was always aware of a creeping junta presence behind her and did her best to toe the line between aiding Myanmar's democratic transition and satisfying the junta--even if that meant turning a blind eye towards atrocities against the Rohingya. In the end, Suu Kyi's worst nightmares came true even when she cooperated *with* the military. I'm not sure it's my role to decide whether Suu Kyi is good or bad--we can let history decide that. But I think she definitely did have a rationale for her actions.

This is a long description and not all of it for the record is off the top of my head, I relied on quite a bit of research to craft my answer. But I hope this answers all of your questions and does justice to a conflict that is complicated, tragic, and consequential in equal measures and doesn't receive as much media attention as it deserves.","lrlrwoq"

I appreciate this analysis. My own (loose) world view is that most leaders and figures of power aren't as wonderful as we pretend, nor as bad as we claim. I'm just not a fan of cults of personalities, or political awards, etc - especially for people who are still in power.

I'm sure my views are still biased, but I try to learn a bit about a situation, and understand some views and factions - rather than judge good or bad. Especially since I know I'm always getting a filtered view of the actual situation.

Not an illusion, but a reality that is consistently ignored by the media and our government. So clearly something we have to keep talking about. I wasn't suggesting she is the only person I have ever encountered to have brought up Palestine. Also, for what it's worth, those who are protesting are often suppressed. I work for a higher education institution in the UK that prohibited students from hanging flags from their windows last spring. It was never a problem before, but for some reason the two Palestinian flags prompted action. This was against massive and enomously well-articulated student objections that were in no way illusory either - but which was swept under the rug as the hyper-sensitivity of naive young people. 

> I pointed out that folks value persevering in our joy and light and celebration of life and humanity even during the times (all of recorded time) that something horrifying/war is happening somewhere

Yes. But again (this is the third time I am explaining this) Han Kang is not abstaining from celebration during her own oppression because she is not being oppressed. She has a normal life. She does not need to persevere in joy and light and celebration of life and humanity in the midst of something horrible. This is the first time I have ever encountered the idea that celebrating your own joy while bad things are happening to others elsewhere is a sign of moral strength and resilience in the same way that celebrating while something horrifying is happening to you is. I don't think this is a matter of values. It just seems clear that they are completely different things.

You realize the US is a capitalistic oligarchy right? This is why you have laws/policies that do not benefit the majority of the population (ie tax, healthcare, emergency relief as can be seen in florida, weapons etc). You could easily compare it with other countries and see that the US is often lagging behind in many areas.

The US runs a number of proxy wars - including Ukraine, Israel/Western Asia, Syria (2011ish onward) and others. And yes, some soldiers/troops are fighting/on the ground at risk of injury or death.

Ah but you‚Äôre waiting for a formal declaration of war. You realize that WWI/II were declared to be WW until well after the start right? Since you‚Äôre a military buff one would expect you to know that wars are politically unpopular and a declaration would occur much later. 

No conspiracy. US is a country that likes to portray itself as a thriving first world democracy, when it‚Äôs the opposite. You agree with that too, acknowledging that elites dominate the country, but then have the gall to squawk about checks and balances as though it‚Äôs a fair system. You also squawk that concluding that a system which has allowed the rich to get richer and the middle class and poor to get poorer over the last 50 years or so is a conspiracy theory.
