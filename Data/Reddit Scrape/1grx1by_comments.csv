The reason is that most of the elements of emotional abuse have been normalized there for a very long time.  According to [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/emotional-abuse), the warning signs are:

• Monitoring and controlling a person’s behavior, such as who they spend time with or how they spend money. 

• Threatening a person’s safety, property, or loved ones

• Isolating a person from family, friends, and acquaintances

• Demeaning, shaming, or humiliating a person

• Extreme jealousy, accusations, and paranoia

• Delivering constant criticism

• Regular ridicule or teasing

• Making acceptance or care conditional on a person’s choices

• Refusing to allow a person to spend time alone

• Thwarting a person’s professional or personal goals

• Instilling self-doubt and worthlessness 

• Gaslighting: making a person question their competence and even their basic perceptual experiences.

With the exception of ""Refusing to allow a person to spend time alone,"" every single one of these is normalized on Twitter/X.

The community there is literally abusive.  I'm on Mastadon - it has some proper safeguards against most of this.",""

Misinformation spreads more easily and community notes is far too slow to effectively combat it.

Hence why I have basically never stepped foot on Twitter (I briefly had an account in high school so we could mass tweet our superintendent to give us a MUCH needed snow day. That was it lol).

TBH I voted for Harris because Jan 6 coup attempt, so I don’t really count. But I do think the mainstream media do have a kind of uniform center-left opinion and there are some right wing people I follow on there as a counterbalance or because I find them entertaining. Fauci lied on masks; ‘mostly peaceful protests’ still had huge amounts of property damage; NYT had a big article on the gender gap in math being bigger at better schools… which conveniently ignored the fact, *visible on the graphs*, that boys were hugely behind in reading (and in some cases math!) almost everywhere else. 

Now, of course, we see them admit there's a boy crisis and that defunding the police was a bad diea. The left leaning media does lie less than the right leaning media; they have better fact-checking and ethics, overall. But they lie about different things, and that is why right leaning media retains some utility.

There is a lack of conservative media with high journalistic quality, I will be the first to admit. The WSJ is probably closest but concentrated heavily on business news as you might expect. 

As I have gotten older I no longer expect any one source to be fair. I read Jacobin, the New Republic, NYT, WSJ, and a few of these weird guys on Twitter and make up my own mind. Sadly the Atlantic and National Review have gone paywall.

tl'dr: There's no free speech from any one source, read a bunch of different views and make up your own mind. I will probably make a Threads or Bluesky account when it's clear which one is the Twitter replacement.","lx9pi2q"

It's the difference between having an open community and having just another 4chan.

Migrating means leaving one location and going somewhere else.  When birds migrate they aren't in two place at once. They haven't left Twitter.  Every company branches out to every social media platform to advertise. This isn't a scenario with limited resources where they're only allowed to use two social media platforms at a time.

>""YOUR BODY. OUR CHOICE. FOREVER"" is still up and has inspired young men to harass young women, including in person. It was tweeted by a person who was reinstated by Musk. That's a tangible example, with real life consequences, of how it's gotten worse.

Yeah dude I'm sure all the world's evils are because of Nick Fuentes - someone nobody takes seriously.

>I genuinely don't understand why this is so important to you. People are leaving a social media site. Why does that bother you?

People are seeking attention by announcing that they are leaving a social media site, in response to being butthurt about the results of the election.  They aren't leaving because it's ""toxic"" - especially when people like Stephen King promoted toxicity with most of his tweets.  They're leaving because they're angry at the results of the election.

Despite all of this, you somehow felt inspired to rebut the comment that he's had his share of hateful angry tweets with a question that's easily answerable with a single simple Google search.

"lxaf4tb","ladydeadpool24601","2024-11-15 16:46:54 UTC","If anything, you should be angry that big publications aren’t focusing on the class gap in education. Underfunded schools continue to be underfunded because they don’t have the necessary resources and tools to improve their student attendance and scores and in turn are given less funding. Richer schools have the resources and tools to keep their kids in the class and allow them to achieve the highest scores possible and in turn receive more funding. 


Poor schools are punished and receive less funding. Rich schools are rewarding and receive more funding. The gender gap in stem is because of a history of pushing girls out of these subjects then bullying girls who do study these subjects. Women in stem today still face incredible amounts of sexism and prejudice because of their gender and it makes their jobs harder to do. 


The gender gap in reading is not rooted in sexism against the male reader. I’m sure there is a class gap in reading though. Boys and teen boys who come from richer families probably have higher literacy levels than those from poorer or middle class families. This also includes access to libraries. There is also the possibility that environment plays a role in this gender gap. Parents who don’t push their sons to read instead of spending hours playing video games or watching TikTok videos will obviously fall behind on their literacy. 


You’re subtly trying to paint issues regarding women and girls as bad or woke because there are issues men and boys face that aren’t being talked about when they are. Just not by the same publication.","lx9xq11"

That is pretty equal across both spectrums, the rest are just policy concerns which is mostly subjective. But otherwise completely agree with you, and am a little unnerved that such a rational take is being downvoted.
