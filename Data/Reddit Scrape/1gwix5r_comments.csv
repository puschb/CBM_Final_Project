"lya7dzk","cavegrind","2024-11-21 18:20:17 UTC","> Also it wasn’t even scary.

Horror doesn't necessarily have to be scary to be effective. It's not one of those books set up to be terrifying (Exorcist), nauseating (any Splatterpunk), or thrilling (any whodunit). Cosmic Horror is just about confronting the unknown and how we deal with that. The Navidsons reevaluating their relationship, Holloway's focus on social status, Truant's retreating into fantasy and sex - just reactions to strange situations. All far more believable then the 'ole Lovecraft ""I write this with shaky hands from an insane asylum"". (I say that as a huge Weird Lit / Cosmic Horror / Lovecraft fan.)

They were painfully boring. The gimmick of being able to ""travel"" through the book only emphasized this. The one character of interest was his mother, whose absence was palpable.

I did learn that the author is the brother of the singer Poe, and her song ~~Haunted~~ Hey Pretty has him reading an excerpt.

That incongruence is totally intentional, and johnny truant is objectively just a piece of shit with some empathy thrown in via the mom letters in the appendix.  More to the point, he is actively trying to distract the reader from the house and from the book, which is simultaneously what he is trying to manifest for himself.  Unfortunately, he cannot ignore the house, which is the story's primary focus (consider the title).  

Personally, I love it, and the way the book uses space fascinates me as a reader, writer, and thinker.  It speaks not only to the many ways that symbols can be interpreted by others, but inherently attempts to represent the more implicit ways that symbols can exist as well.  It is kinda like the unseen in the scene, if you will, and the house's labyrinthian corridors is one of many ways in which that implicit image is created.  Also, and this is probably just a me thing too, but it's the time it takes to read this book that is a part of the text.  In a way, it is like we are being forced to venture into places we don't want to go, only we can inevitably close the book (whether due to boredom, terror, exhaustion, whatever).  

In all, ya, I get why you may not like it, but it's always worth reconsidering at a different time in your life.

That being said, I can see why it was a cultural touchstone for a particular era in time. It might make a better film than a book, since the visuals stuck with me and were very visceral. I also like the creativity of the layout. The non-linear ability to jump around to different sections in the book, the selective font coloring. I like that it played with symbolism.

Jon Hodgman wrote a few books like that, where he'd write the history of the United States, but have several presidents have hooks for hands and weave in a roving, appearing and disappearing 51st state whose inhabitants were equally mysterious.

Chapters full of fake footnotes, edits upon edits, dry diversions, omissions, and nested footnotes (from people with different priorities and voices) were a ton of fun. The director and his family were great and the slow unfolding of the mystery worked; the horror didn't go as far as I was expecting/hoping but the unknowable, all-erasing nature of the House hit home for me.

The Johnny Truant stuff has its highs but sometimes just felt like a vehicle for creative writing exercises to me. Based on how it started, I expected his storyline to unravel far more and be far more connected to the House, and be written so well it left me the reader in fear of the basilisk effect of that manuscript and that House on my mind. None of that happened. Neither did many of the things Danielewski tried with the formatting and type do much for me in the end; those parts definitely piqued my appetite while flipping through the thing but weren't nearly as holistic to the overall story as I had hoped.

I don't want to go into spoilers but basically the ending to the Navidson record completely ruined that part of the story for me. It's just fails to deal with any underlying problems at all.

Then the ending to the Zampano and Truant stories was even worse, especially if you consider the, I guess, ""puzzle"" ending, which makes even less sense. Wrap that into a surface level satire of academia which cannot carry a book as long as this, and for me all you get is a pretentious mess of ideas, presented as a mess of a book with none of the ideas actually being brought to a satisfying conclusion. Genuinely started to get annoyed reading it purely because I found the ""plot"" to be horrible the further it went on and it made me feel like I had wasted my time, which to me is a surefire way to leave a horrible impression. 

The only really great part in it is that the ergodic elements are masterfully implemented and the Whalestoe Letters (not sure if spelling is accurate, its been a while) were actually interesting and really pulled me in. Luckily, you can get that as a separate book, without the other three manuscripts of the author that accidentally ended up in the ""house of leaves"" pile after going through a shredder.

Return of the Living Dead is *fucking terrifying* with comedic elements. I didn't sleep properly for a month after seeing it at a sleepover as a kid.

As a follow-up, but longer book **The Hacienda** by Isabel Cañas has scenes that are great homages to Jackson's haunted house, but set in 1840s Mexico and it goes in a very different direction with the haunting.

My current top pick for more recent books is another fairly short one - **Piranesi** by Susanna Clarke. The House here is also infinite and there's definitely a sense of unease, though it doesn't quite veer all the way into horror. I definitely think if you bounced off House of Leaves but liked the house, you would like this one. I love it.

A more benign but sentient and finicky house is found in **Last Tale of the Flower Bride** by Roshani Chokshi. This is also a book that toes the line of gothic horror, but leans more magical realism overall in character. This one is more regular novel length - like 300 pages.

Overall settings or landscapes that function as characters with or without some kind of sentience is a broader category, but two that have stood out to me are the bizarre dream world of **Palimpsest** by Catherynne M. Valente (as long as you're okay with some pretty unsexy sex, as entrance to the city is gained through sex) and Jeff Vandermeer's Southern Reach series, but especially the first one **Annhiliation** wherein the landscape itself is very much hostile even though it appears a normal stretch of isolated swampy southern US coastline.

This is the key, though. You can understand why something would be unsettling without needing it to unsettle you.

The central idea behind House of Leaves is that your home, the place you should feel safest in the world is actually alien to you, behaving in ways contrary to how reality works, shifting, and changing, purposely ejecting your pets, and possibly swallowing your family whole. It works in the same way as Amittyville Horror, though far less overt and far more philosophical. It's a haunted house story. Your sense of safety is shattered. Then, the simple act of observing those dark rooms brings out the worst impulses in the people who experience it; which is a different sense of menace then any other haunted house where ghosts or demons are actively attacking the characters.

It's fine that you think it's overwrought, gimmicky, and pretentious. It's fine that you weren't scared of it, or that OP wasn't terrified when reading it. That doesn't mean that it isn't *Horror*, though.","lybr9px"

""Satire applies to writing that exposes or ridicules conduct, doctrines, or institutions either by direct criticism or more often through irony, parody, or caricature.""

In my opinion, the fake portions of the book are very much caricaturing the obsessive analysis of poor-quality academic writing. Academia struggles with issues related to plagiarism, misrepresenting data, and posturing to an extreme sometimes, and to me, this is such an excellent satire of that general approach. 

There are many academics and armchair historians/writers who will do anything to sound ""enlightened"" or revolutionary when their works are entirely derivative or even, ultimately, meaningless. Tragically for me, I've read my fair share of self-absorbed academic texts, and the book absolutely wants to parody them. It's a caricature of horrible academic writing, paired with horror elements as Zampano loses his grasp on reality.

I'm a little confused about what you're talking about when it comes to stealing from the cited works. A huge chunk of them aren't even real-- they're invented for the book. Anything about the Navidson Record is obviously fake. The actual citations are generally to public domain works and pop culture references. 

The erroneous use and weird interpretations of the real stuff is another part of the satire: Zampano sometimes doesn't even really comprehend what he's citing or why, but it ""looks"" official and smart, so he includes a hideous amount of citations, even if they aren't relevant. Grade enough papers or read enough drafts of academic writing and you'll see this in spades, in the worst of ways. 

The whole point of the footnotes becomes their absurdity as Zampano slaps down citation after citation without a real reason for using most of them.","lya75zf"

But crucially, not *all* of them are, and quite a large number are in fact citing actual academic papers in highly empirical fields ranging from archaeology to condensed matter physics. You can do a library search and find them. And, almost all of the footnotes describing what those *actual articles* say, are straight-up lying, in a way that not only misrepresents the papers' interpretations or conclusions, but in fact misrepresents their empirical findings.

Yeah, there's a reason why when we teach students how to do the work of academic writing, we nip that kind of behavior in the bud as fast as we can. But even then, to not merely take an article out of context but instead to claim it says *the opposite* of what it says, is not possible if you're just spamming random citations; it requires Danielewski to have read each of those papers and understood them well enough to then lie about the details. It is transparently not the work of a random slacker, but a meticulous effort at fabrication and misrepresentation.

>Academia struggles with issues related to plagiarism, misrepresenting data, and posturing to an extreme sometimes,

Here's the problem with both your and Danielewski's take: ""Academia"" is not one monolithic thing. The standards of writing are *wildly* different across scholarly fields, as are the specific ways in which plagiarism, misrepresenting data, and posturing manifest. Compare cultural anthropology, in which practically every paper is expected to advance the state of current theory, with analytical chemistry, where you can basically just say ""hey, we measured these properties of this compound, here's a table, hope y'all find that useful!"" Citation spam could hypothetically appear in either paper, but it's going to interact with the text in extremely different ways, because both the goals of the paper and the function of citations within the paper are different. Thus, while the way Danielewski uses citation spam in HOL might look like a parody of some specific kinds of academic writing, it's utterly unrecognizable to most of the fields he's drawing citations from.

But again, even if you're prepared to paint all scholarship with a broad brush and just go along with the premise that the entirety of academia is corrupt and untrustworthy, remember what point that idea is in service of: that truth doesn't exist, and so libel and falsification and theft are totally legitimate (and how could you possibly object to that point if ""academia"" is doing all those things anyway?).

Post-structuralists used satire to deconstruct the notion that truth derives from the authority of experts, rather than rigorous labor. In HOL, Danielewski instead uses libel to distort truth by legitimizing disinformation in place of that rigorous labor.","lyadfhx"

Having lived hard(read as homeless), thanks to trauma and alcohol, as a migrant worker out west, his story and his voice are very convincing. He's not supposed to be a good writer. He's a damaged self-absorbed tragedy, and he's falling apart.

Oh, I know. I'm sure Danielewski knows, too. It's one of the reasons why Zampano uses such a ridiculously large swath of texts: Zampano does not understand this. He's using a stupidly large range of sources from a ridiculous number of fields. 

>Thus, while the way Danielewski uses citation spam in HOL might look like a parody of some specific kinds of academic writing, it's utterly unrecognizable to most of the fields he's drawing citations from.

I think that's the point.

>Yeah, there's a reason why when we teach students how to do the work of academic writing, we nip that kind of behavior in the bud as fast as we can.

This is also the point. Zampano is not one of those students. Nor is he an academic. He is an unhinged man writing a nonsensical text.

>even if you're prepared to paint all scholarship with a broad brush and just go along with the premise that the entirety of academia is corrupt and untrustworthy

I am not sure why you think I believe this. I specified poor-quality academic writing is like this, and that academia struggles with issues of plagiarism/data manipulation/posturing-- because it does. That doesn't make all of academia corrupt and untrustworthy. 

> remember what point that idea is in service of: that truth doesn't exist, and so libel and falsification and theft are totally legitimate

This is where you lose me. It seems like quite the leap. Zampano, the character in the book who is using the citations, is not the author. Zampano is a man who is losing his mind cobbling together a fake paper about a fake documentary. Zampano wants to sound smart, wants to use sources with fancy names, and wants to prove his completely insane points. We're arguing about a character who has no grip on reality and whether he used his citations immorally. That's absurd in of itself (and a part of why I love talking about this weird book).

>it requires Danielewski to have read each of those papers and understood them well enough to then lie about the details. It is transparently not the work of a random slacker, but a meticulous effort at fabrication and misrepresentation.

The whole book is about fabrication and misrepresentation of reality. I don't know why any reader would take his citations seriously, nor believe Zampano's completely wrong interpretations simply because they are present.

I really, truly don't think Danielewski has some kind of vendetta against these authors and is purposefully maliciously portraying their works. He's writing a character that has no idea what he's talking about. If someone is pulling their academic references and relying on sources as they're portrayed in  *House of Leaves* for their own writing, I think that's a totally separate issue, lol. 

 Is there a specific work that bothers you in how it's misrepresented? To me, the wildly incorrect presentation of the sources adds to the point of the book. If anything, the fact that you recognize works in your field and how they're being horribly misrepresented emphasizes how ridiculous of a narrator Zampano is.","lyalpsn"

And when part of your subject matter is the difficulty of knowing anything at all, that seems like pretty great choice.

My point is actually that Danielewski is using them *in the same context*. It is not some grand literary statement about epistemology. It is evil.

I mean, isn't it a bit much to assert that this work of fiction should be rejected because it is.. offensive for portraying a kind of universe that we wouldn't much like to live in?

I don't see how the artefact of the book and it's metaphysics translates directly to a claim that this too can and must reflect our own world.  I do think the book in many ways deftly finds and explores the horror that comes from such a world, a kind of horror that I find vastly more interesting than an endless parade of murderers and supernatural antagonists.  The idea that such a universe is possible and may be the one we live in should be profoundly terrifying.

And I think a book can be valuable for reflecting what such a world run by Maxwell's Demons might actually be like, and it helps us reflect on what it might share or not share with our own world, and encourages examining our presuppositions about what we think we know (surely something us scientists ought to rally behind).  We can agree Paul Feyerabend for example is anti-epistemology, sure. But.. isn't it true to say that Kuhn, in some important ways, is anti-epistemology as well?  Do we really mean to say that our exploration of the universe we find ourselves in should go as far as Popper and that anything past Popper amounts to an intolerable attack upon meaning itself?

Do we get mad at Margaret Atwood for depicting a world and presuming that the world she depicts must be one she thinks is congruent with our own ? Or assume what she depicts is reflects her desires for how the world ought to work?   Is that the function of reading a book? Simply to pronounce on the palatability of the depicted world?","lycbgh5"

Except that Danielewski isn't making claims about a fictional world. That ceases to be the case the moment he cites a work of academic scholarship that actually exists IRL. By bringing in the work of real world scholars, Danielewski is *necessarily* making a claim about their work and their legitimacy, and the specific claim he's making is that he can blatantly misuse that work to make an utterly banal literary argument.

And to be clear, I am not arguing that post-structuralism is anti-epistemology; that's patently absurd. The epistemological basis of post-structuralism is an entirely warranted critique of knowledge systems based on hierarchical authority, e.g. Popper's notion of paradigmatic consensus. Danielewski is not engaging in anything remotely resembling that argument; he is instead asserting an obscurantist position that truth doesn't exist, he's lying in order to do so, and in so doing he directly goes against the post-structuralist epistemological foundation that truth derives from honest, rigorous work.

HOL is not even remotely comparable to Kuhn or Atwood; it is reactionary nihilism which gussies itself up in the vibes of postmodern writing specifically to undermine it. It's the same kind of bullshit as the Sokal hoax paper, and it is just as detrimental in a world where ""post-truth"" is increasingly popular.","lychwtg"
