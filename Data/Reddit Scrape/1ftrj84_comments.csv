I also recommend the movie, if you like horror movies, and aren't squeamish. The book is pretty disturbing, to be honest. It isn't a ""fun read"", but it's a page-turner, and has a good story. It's about some young people going on a vacation to Mexico, and they stumble into a real-life nightmare.

A Stephen King​ quote, saying it's the "" best horror novel of the new century"" is featured prominently on the book, so I guess even King liked it. Anyway, it came out back in 2006. There is​ more of a feeling of emotion and sadness to some of the book, near the end, than what I remember in my first reading - I noticed this upon re-reading it. It even made me close to tears, to be honest, regarding one particular (horrifying) scene. I would recommend this book.

Next on my Halloween reading list, will be a book called ""Depraved"", by Bryan Smith. I watched a book review-based YouTuber, who recommended it.

"lpz51ak","ravensflockinPNW","2024-10-02 13:51:14 UTC","I started my Fall/Spooky reading in September to get me in the mood.
So far I’ve read:
1. Slewfoot: A Tale of Bewitchery by Brom

2. The September House by Carissa Orlando

3. The Spellshop by Sarah Beth Durst

4. Vampires of El Norte by Isabel Cañas

5. A Sorceress Comes to Call by T. Kingfisher

6.Bookshops and Bonedust by Travis Baldree

This was my first season reading anything horror/scary and I was really pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed some of these books! I might actually give Stephen King a try in the future (The Shining and Misery are some of my favorite movies) And I of course sprinkled in the cozy books as palate cleansers. 

Next up to read:

House of Leaves by Mark Danielewski

Frankenstein by Mary Shelley

Perfume: The Story of a Murderer by Patrick Süskind

How to Sell a Haunted House by Grady Hendrix

The Nature of Witches by Rachel Griffin

It's about a woman who moves into a haunted house, but it's her dream house and she refuses to let the ghosts chase her out. The premise sounded very funny, but the book was so lackluster to me, I gave up.

Determined to pick another book appropriate for spooky season, I started Fairy Tale by Stephen King. I'm about 20% in and hardly anything has happened. It's very slow. The main character is a teenage boy, but it's not written in the voice of a teenage boy. I just got to a part where something scaryish happens, but there is little indication yet why it is called Fairy Tale. I have some theories.

Despite the book being kind of boring and the writing being not very interesting, I am interested in seeing where the story goes.

A more obvious gothic mystery (but great read if you haven't got to it yet) is **Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conan Doyle**. 

If you like gothic haunted houses, **The Uninvited by Dorothy Macardle** and **Woman in Black by Susan Hill** are both great. **A Turn of the Screw** is also worth a go for a haunting, plus pretty short.","lpuri8h"

"lpux7u5","bluezoop","2024-10-01 19:16:37 UTC","have you checked out universal harvester? i'm about to get into part 2 and it's soooo unsettling so far. he's so clever with it!

i definitely recommend giving mister magic another try! idk what about it specifically did it for me, but it's a favorite now","lpuenuz"

"lpvu469","Mars1176","2024-10-01 22:10:16 UTC","Thanks for the suggestions!  I've actually already read most of those, and I recently watched the Picture of Dorian Grey movie ( I enjoyed it, and as a horror movie fan I was surprised to find it creepier than i expected to). Carmilla has been on my tbr forever, and I'll definitely check out the dream woman and the uninvited","lpvdap2"

I DNF this book. It feels so long reading this book.","lpwoein"

I have Our Share of Night tagged to read when I pare down my checkout list. I’ve never read any of her work, but I’ve listened to a sample from Things We’ve Lost in the Dark and I’m already a fan","lpuzsln"

"lpvsiro","JSB19","2024-10-01 22:01:03 UTC","Honestly McCammon isn’t *scary* scary if you know what I mean. He puts some horror in each book but it’s not constant and it probably won’t keep you up at night.

If I had to pick one I’d say They Thirst which is his take on the vampire legend. Doesn’t reinvent the wheel or expand the lore, just a really solid good vampire story.","lpva4bb"

I agree, he does a great job with pacing and making you feel like you are watching it unfold. Throws in a lot of twists and deaths as well that I didn't see coming.","lpzp4gm"

"lpv2s13","jgallo10","2024-10-01 19:45:18 UTC","Yes! It’s been a while but I definitely remember Universal Harvester being weird and unsettling at points but also kind of touching and thoughtful at others. 

I was really into Mister Magic when I was reading it, I’m not sure why I put it down for so long. Excited to get back into that one!","lpux7u5"
"lpzet4m","D3athRider","2024-10-02 14:46:43 UTC","Personally I quite liked it! It's definitely different from a lot of his other stuff in that I found it had more of an emotional component with the development of the sibling relationship and family dynamics. I also didn't find it particularly scary oddly enough, but was on point with his usual sense of humour. Imo his book that balanced creepy with comedy the best (all his stuff leans horror comedy) was Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires.","lpzc7dy"
"lpzcdhx","D3athRider","2024-10-02 14:33:21 UTC","If you're looking for some old school gothic horror definitely. It's not a jump scare or ghost type horror, so much as an unsettling, creeping atmosphere. A bit like Lovecraft's The Outsider or similar vein.","lpz8zy4"
"lpzdub9","D3athRider","2024-10-02 14:41:24 UTC","Yeah, definitely worth reading even if you've seen the show. While I didn't watch the show (I love the book and didn't want to see it potentially ruined lol), my partner did (who also loves the book) and she said it was very different. For example, the show's decision to make the characters all family members ruins the importance of the relationships and dynamics in the book.","lpyp8a6"

"lq3del3","bluezoop","2024-10-03 05:03:50 UTC","🥲i finished universal harvester and i see what you meant! sadly was anticipating it to be a  ~cosmic analog horror ~ but it turned out as more of an exploration of loneliness with some thriller moments. not what i imagined but definitely still wonderfully written!","lpv2s13"
"lq2r4q4","bluezoop","2024-10-03 02:10:16 UTC","ah that's very good to know! i'm definitely wanting to aim more toward scary, so i may have to do a switcheroo😄","lpzet4m"

"lpzhnix","lucifero25","2024-10-02 15:02:09 UTC","So I loved the show and the fact the book is so different makes me more interested to read it tbh. Plus now I can visualise what they and the house look like better so … imo it’s a win win","lpzdub9"
"lrdfc72","YoullNeverBeRebecca","2024-10-11 05:49:56 UTC","Still need to finish the book and watch the show at all, but I like that the show is (apparently) markedly different. It means I won’t just be repeating an experience I already had (reading the book). And hopefully can expound upon themes from the book and use them to explore other topics - ex. like the Watchmen TV series did with the comics.","lpzdub9"
