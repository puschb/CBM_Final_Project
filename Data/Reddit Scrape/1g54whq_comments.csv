If a book is originally written in English, I enjoy reading it in that language, with the author's own words. On the other hand, I like to support Portuguese's book market (which is, unfortunately, small) and there are really amazing translators out there who deserve the recognition...

When I first started reading English books, it was to learn / get better and maintain my English skills... now it's just kinda normal for me to read almost all books in English. Most books I read are originally written in English, so the English version is usually available earlier. Sometimes you have to wait ages for a translation, some books never get one. Also, sometimes English books are a bit cheaper. And they are super easy to get, so it doesn't really make a huge difference anyway.

I may buy more digital copies in other languages I can read. A typical case for me would be Tolkien or Conan Doyle, or Harry Potter which I have in many languages all.

However when it comes to translations, I do chose to read fiction in french even if translated from english, but sometimes make exception for books where I think the original prose is important and when the book isn‚Äôt too long.
Like I chose to read the bell jar in english because I thought that since Sylvia Plath is mostly a poet, a translation of her work even with prose wouldn‚Äôt have felt right and also it didn‚Äôt seem too hard to read.
However I chose to read Orlando by Wolfe in french because even though her prose and choice of words is very specific and important, I knew that reading it in english might have hindered on my focus/understanding of certain sentences because of the language being too complicated. Also I feel like it was very well translated the sentences in this book moved me +++
However. I read some Toni Morrison in french once, and I think the translation destroyed the charm of the book and made it more robotic than it was initially written. AAVE doesn‚Äôt translate very well in french and it feels like a barrier when it comes to understanding the characters etc. I will definitely only read her work in english moving forward because it‚Äôs too culturally related to it to translate well in french etc

When it comes to essays though, I always read the original material, if an essay is gonna be hard to read it‚Äôs gonna be hard to read no matter the language because of specific academic terms, plus it‚Äôs like being spoken to directly by someone and I‚Äôd be worried some facts would get twisted with translations. Somehow I‚Äôd say my favourite essayists have been english authors too (Julia Serano, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna Samarasinha for example). French essayists often try too hard with the elitism and academism that makes their prose stuffy. But completely depends. Like Mona Chollet‚Äôs last book flows so well, but her first one from 20 years ago was a fucking complicated word jungle nightmare.

I primarily read translated books in my native language (Lithuanian), but sometimes I choose English books over translations if they are easier to come by (for example, The Heart of Darkness has apparently been translated to Lithuanian, but I couldn't find it anywhere, although I managed to get an English version for cheap) or if the translations aren't very good (e.g. Irvine Welsh's iconic Scots dialect is non-existent in the Lithuanian versions of his novels).

There are also some authors books by whom have been translated and are accessible, but I still prefer to read them in the original language (e.g. Dostoevsky's translations aren't bad, but the Russian originals still flow much better, so I read his works in Russian).

And lastly, I read some books in German as I want to get better at it and they help me with that. I've read most of Erich Maria Remarque's works in Lithuanian, so now I'm doing it in German, and I think this has really helped me expand my vocabulary and understand the grammar better.",""

"lsda57r","depressanon7","2024-10-17 14:31:25 UTC","My native language is greek, but nowadays I read mostly in english. 

There's a couple reasons, to be honest. First, there are inevitably things lost in translation between languages (e.g. I'm currently reading *Beacon 23* by Hugh Howey in greek. In the first few pages there was a note that the original differentiates between a beacon and a lighthouse, but both those words translate to the same word in greek, so the distinction is more difficult to make).

Second, for some reason books from the UK are cheaper than books printed here. I assume it's due to added translation costs as well as greek publishing houses choosing heavier paper, which makes for better quality but also higher prices.

And third, and most important I think, a lot of stuff never gets translated in the first place, or is that much more difficult to find and/or expensive if it is. The first time I saw a translated copy of *Six of Crows* was last year, following the show's success and the book's becoming popular on booktok. One of my favourite series is *The Stormlight Archive*. The first book of that does exist in translation - cut up into 4 parts, which means you need 50-60 euro to buy all of em. And that is book 1 of four currently published in the series, and the rest are still not out in greek. It's a matter of convienience, at this point. The inverse is also true sometimes; I mentioned *Beacon 23* earlier. It hasn't been published in Europe (essentially, it hasn't been published in the UK, since that is where the vast majority of books in english come from, in the greek market at least) so the options are the translated copy, or the printed-in-the-US original. The US one was available, but it was cheaper and easier to get the greek one. I'm not too cut up about it to be honest, it's a good translation as far as I can tell.",""

"ls8rfno","PhysicalAd7028","2024-10-16 18:45:34 UTC","I'm Finnish, i also speak English and am currently studying Swedish. Although i do read books in English, i tend to prefer a Finnish translation. This is not that usual in my friend group, and not the case for my boyfriend, for example - he always wants to read the book in its original language if possible, which more often than not is English. I think he might have a better vocabulary than me and has surely consumed a lot more english-language media than i have, from a younger age also. This is what i attribute our different preferences to. For me, the English language is more like a useful tool, as for him i think it is somehow more integrated as ""a second language"". I feel very strongly that Finnish is my ""emotional language"" and English is just the lingua franca that allows me to access a huge amount of information i otherwise couldn't. When reading a book from a writer like Virginia Woolf for example - i see the value in reading the original, but for me a skillfully translated version in my mother tongue that i feel like i can really, deeply understand without having to google a single word (and the words she uses! Whew!) feels often more appealing. 
Nevertheless, i do sometimes read books in English, for variety and to be able to coherently write in English myself - just not ""primarily"" as many of my friends seem to do.  :-)

I do also read books in Swedish. My skill level is not that high - i can understand text concerning everyday topics and often miss a word or two, my vocabulary is not that big but luckily Swedish has a lot of words whose meaning can be deduced from English/Finnish. I think reading books in your target language is a great way to learn, it is genuinely very fun and engaging to read a book in a language you only understand very imperfectly. A lot of deducing, i almost feel like a detective. It's like a puzzle. Poetry is also fun in a language you are not fluent in, on top of the usual ""oh, now it all comes together"" feeling you sometimes get when reading a good poem, you get extra kicks from figuring out new words and expressions on the way. Google translate & dictionaries are my friend and i don't use them sparingly. Poems are also great because they can be easy to memorize and the brain has an easier time remembering information with emotional content attached! If you read a poem that deeply touches you you are much more likely to remember singular words used in it long-term. (Btw take this as an anecdote, not like, waterproof scientific info lol, i only did high-school psychology) 
The Swedish language not only is the second official language of Finland but also plays a big role in Finnish culture and history - there's a huge amount of Finnish artists, writers, poets - especially before the 20th century - that were swedish-speaking. It's fun to be able to unlock and explore something like that!

"lsf5x58","Katlix","2024-10-17 20:29:47 UTC","I agree. Venugopalan Ittekot (such a great pseunonym I still remember it) translated Discworld books into Dutch into such an ingenious way. Then for some unknown reason Maskerade was not translated by him and it showed. As if it wasn't originally written by Pratchett at all. I see on wiki that it was later retranslated by Ittekot and re-released. Doesn't matter, because after that I switched to the original English versions and never went back. Funnily enough, Maskerade is one of my favourite Discworld novels! My favourite witches novel for sure. (after re-reading it in English obviously)","lsc271r"

It's not bad at all if you get a reader that lets you turn off the backlight.","lsaghui"

You log in to your account and access your purchased ebooks but can't move your ebooks to an eReader, for example. But downloaded ebooks can be accessed offline on your app. I read on my phone and find the app super convenient and smooth to use.","lscn4ox"
