These were part of the “flightpath to reading” in the UK between the late 70s-late 80s). He included each and every page of the books too. They originally start off with a couple of sentences on each page with gorgeous art work and with each stage the books advance. Sentences become paragraphs and less artwork and more story. They were made for kids around 7-10 (a couple of “novellas” were written for the older kids). 

I owe not only my love of fantasy, mystery and adventure but to reading in general to those books. And it was amazing to revisit them all in this way.

I still read Calvin and Hobbs comic books again and again 

I also enjoy YA Christian Fiction....  which some people condemn me for.... but honestly there aren't very many Christian Authors that write entertainment for adults. Unfortunately some of the ones who do write Christian fiction for adults... include some rather distasteful content along with it such as Christopher Hoppers latest book which states that a prison guard was watching pornhub on his tablet....  which honestly I find completely inappropriate for Christian writing. Another series from Frank Peretti, Angela Meyes and other authors combined is very good but again it's stated that pornography was playing in the background... I got past that but I think they took it too far when two of the characters strapped themselves into chairs and performed astral projection. Watching themselves leave their body behind floating into the air and traveling by the mind. I'm probably being overly sensitive but I grew up hearing that astral projection was practiced by Occult members and you were not leaving your body behind instead your allowing an evil spirit or demon into your mind who tricks you into thinking that your leaving your body and flying away 

So I stick to YA and Teen Christian fantasy and Scifi books because they don't contain adult situations or descriptions and Wayne Thomas Batsons Adult Christian books since he's yet to write anything uncomfortable in them or Ted Dekker.

They are not just for children. There are also great books that use pictures and comics to explain very complex concepts, but it is an underused medium.

My favorite is ""Unflattening"" [https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674744431](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674744431) by Nick Sousanis, which is actually a university dissertation in the form of a comic book. It is amazing! You can read it as it is, a treatise on the interplay between concepts and the underlying reality they refer to, signs and meaning. It touches very deep ideas in philosophy, so you can also read it in other ways as it explores common and deep ideas that we have been researching since forever... since we are humans capable of abstract thought (the last chapter is titled ""Awakening""!): e.g. this book is great to understand how mystical experiences can help reshape someone's worldview (i.e. spiritual awakening, ""enlightenment""), such as the experience of Samadhi described in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras or the dhyanas in Buddhism  – to be fully in the present moment and experience reality unmediated by the lens of the mind, you need to really transcend concepts and the ego.

Another good one is Yuval Noah Harari's ""Unstoppable Us"" [https://www.ynharari.com/book/unstoppable\\_us/](https://www.ynharari.com/book/unstoppable_us/) which is more accessible also younger audiences, to explain human prehistory, and *Homo Sapiens Sapiens* evolution.",""

The rhyming rabbit was always a great favourite. Handa's surprise was a fantastic intro to descriptions. And every year, we would read ""Thankfully the Milk"", which always has them rolling on the floor with the wumpires. Maybe I should request a lower grade again. Get away from the pre-puberty p4s.","lxrocrl"

To  me picture  books are books that are written like a normal  book but then have pictures accompanying them, most comics have speech bubbles etc. instead. There are comics that are laid out like  picture books though, e.g. Stardust.","lxlujxi"

I don't know if there are other versions but the one I have is made like it's a children's picture book and it has a storybook style of illustration. It's about tiny people that come out of a dead girl's.head and have to survive. They resemble children or dolls and have a personality that can be seen as resembling aspects of a child's mind or stereotypes they may come up with. It's very sad but a great story.","lxlloex"

>picture book is designed primarily for young children, typically aged between 2 and 8 years old. Picture books use illustrations to tell a story, with each page featuring a large, colorful image alongside a few lines of text.
