Precisely, keeping a bedtime book to read before sleeping and to keep a primary book for usual reading. The primary book is a novel and the bedtime one is usually a collection of short stories/ letters/ Essays. I'm actually on my second bedtime, The Anthropocene Reviewed (Collection of essays) and am really enjoying it. Whenever the days are rough and/or I'm not feeling like reading; I always tend to pick up my bedtime book and read a few pages, since the essays/letters/short stories are already a few pages, it encourages me to continue and hence I am able to read everyday; better it be 3 pages than none at all. This, I've found, keeps me more engaged with reading and helps build up a consistent habit. Ofcourse on a perfect day, I would expect to read both my primary novel and the collection of short works, but that's simply not the case for everyday. This practice essentially helped me to be more engaged in progressing through my primary novel aswell as keeping me consistent and preventing myself from going to a slump.",""

I have been recovering from surgery and I read most of the day, it‚Äôs much more relaxing and enjoyable than watching tv but it didn‚Äôt start out that way.

After awhile it‚Äôll feel nature and you‚Äôll be able to read more at time. I find that physical books give off more energy but it‚Äôs all personal preference. If you enjoy just listen just listen. If you rather read on your phone or iPad then do it. You‚Äôre not here to impress anyone so don‚Äôt feel like you need to read a certain way or be a certain way.

Just have to find what you like. Reading shouldn‚Äôt be treated like we are in school. Nobody is going to test you for what you read. And don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. If you have to read a page a couple times than you have to read it a couple times it‚Äôs not a contest. I find that I want to read too many books and sometimes rush through something just to get to the next one or your like comparing yourself to people they read huge books by the day.

4. Sit in bath. 
5. Stare at blank wall of the bathroom until you get so bored you reach for a book. 
6. Read book until you get bored.
7. When you think to yourself, ""whelp, I'm bored. Time to do something else!"" remember that leaving the tub involves being cold, naked, and getting your clothes together. Which is much more difficult and unpleasant than just swapping out books.

Basically, I'm being wasteful of my own time while simultaneously insulting better books by prioritizing books I don't even like. When you think about it, it's actually kind of messed up to prioritize something that sucks (according to your preferences) ahead of something that doesn't suck.

I think we get used to the idea that we should finish unpleasant tasks before letting ourselves have fun, but that can be unhealthy when we apply it to leisure activities like reading. Sure, finish the boring/unpleasant tasks in your life before you sit down with a book, but don't turn books themselves into unpleasant tasks.","luq634d"

Seriously, it's a game changer. Especially with a good narrator. I get distracted if I'm just listening to the audiobook but a combination of the audiobook and then having the written words right in front of my face im more immersed. It helps.","lusw6if"

I'm kind of moving away from wanting to own physical books but I'd be lying if I wasn't tempted to start collecting his leatherbound editions. Being in Canada though, the currency conversion from USD and the shipping fees are keeping me from impulse purchases haha.

I need to branch out more into both other fantasy authors, and to other fiction outside of fantasy in general.","luqdkco"

I'm trying to get into the habit of looking words up when I'm reading a physical book but I definitely did not do that when I was a kid, I tried to read around the word and kinda just guess ü§£","lus9yi6"

I have a 10th gen Paperwhite which was advertised as waterproof. Obviously, not putting it under the showerhead to soak or anything ü§£ü§£but propped up on the soap holder. Away from the water but still at eye level so I could read.","lv3md2l"

"luqkl9i","wizardsfrolikgardens","2024-10-31 18:38:36 UTC","It's so good. 

I would say that the only hunger games aspect is in the first book, since there's the whole teenagers fighting for the amusement of some higher power thing but that's only the first book. After that I'll say it's more like game of thrones in space lol. Lots of political scheming, back stabbing, and fighting. The MC also ages, so we start the series with him being 16/17 and by now he's in his mid 30s in the latest book.","luqjvp5"

Many times go back and look up more details about things mentioned, photographs, people, or books mentioned within the book as something the characters is reading or a part of a poem is making a reference to. Find myself learning a lot from a Historical Fiction book.","lusfeqi"

"luqq3e0","TheWhiteHunter","2024-10-31 19:07:22 UTC","I've found my way into Booktok recently as well and am very wary of the recommendations given there. Thankfully I started reading Brandon Sanderson's works at the recommendation of a friend many years before Tiktok existed.

I have no interest in the genre of young adult fantasy but aged up to college/18+ so they can make it spicy/horny. Booktok keeps throwing that 'A Court of Thorns and Roses' and 'The Fourth Wing' at me which as far as I can tell, falls into that category.

I've read two books I've seen on Booktok thus far:

* James Islington's *Will of the Many* which was fun. I'm looking forward to the sequel which I think comes out next year. It has an interesting world premise and magic system. It is a magic school-esque premise but not the standard grade-by-grade system which is an interesting take. My main critique is how often the main character is knocked unconscious to progress the plot. Dude would definitely have a few concussions already.
* Ryan Cahill's *Of Blood and Fire*, which I'm about 80% through. It's a series with 4 or 5 books. It's very similar to the premise of Eragon and written about as well thus far. It takes a while to get to the part where the main character gets his dragon. I hear it drastically improves with book 2, and I haven't hated book 1 so I'll keep giving this a read for now.","luqhhqa"

"luqrzjv","wizardsfrolikgardens","2024-10-31 19:17:22 UTC","I know there's the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" but you can just *tell* when a book is a ""booktok"" book lol. They gave that ugly ass font and ugly ass cover and probably have a title like ACOTAR. though I'll say that those books are just piggy backing off of the ACOTAR style because ACOTAR came out way way before all of them. So they're just copying the style. 

Then of course, there's the cartoon covers that look like Corporate Memphis art style.","luqq3e0"
"luv8uf1","Comprehensive-Fun47","2024-11-01 15:07:12 UTC","To be fair, ACOTAR is the acronym for the full book title, which appears on the cover in full.","luqrzjv"
"luvcfqk","wizardsfrolikgardens","2024-11-01 15:26:28 UTC","I think you're misunderstanding what I mean. I'm saying that most of these other ""romantasy"" books from booktok copy ACOTAR and it's super blatant from the way they choose their titles, to even the style of the cover lol. But people on there eat it up like a starving man crawling out of a desert. 

I'm just spelling it as ""ACOTAR"" because spelling out the whole title is tedious","luv8uf1"
"luvdqpc","Comprehensive-Fun47","2024-11-01 15:33:21 UTC","Oh I see. You're definitely right about certain genres having certain looks. I thought you thought ACOTAR was the actual title.","luvcfqk"
