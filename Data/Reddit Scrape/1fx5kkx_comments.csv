"lqjx1uz","MyDnDName","2024-10-06 01:44:47 UTC","I enjoyed it.  It was a long process, especially knowing that the next tragedy is coming.  I can only read one of those types of books per year.  I just read ""Angle of Repose"", and it is another book of hopes being dashed.  You might enjoy it?

One of my favorite lines from East of Eden was:

# “When a child first catches adults out -- when it first walks into his grave little head that adults do not always have divine intelligence, that their judgments are not always wise, their thinking true, their sentences just -- his world falls into panic desolation. The gods are fallen and all safety gone. And there is one sure thing about the fall of gods: they do not fall a little; they crash and shatter or sink deeply into green muck. It is a tedious job to build them up again; they never quite shine. And the child's world is never quite whole again. It is an aching kind of growing.”",""

"lqkgl1c","FLEXXMAN33","2024-10-06 04:03:16 UTC","A few quotes I liked: (I don't think anything here is a spoiler.)  
  
> Cyrus wanted a woman to take care of Adam. He needed someone to keep house and cook, and a servant cost money. He was a vigorous man and needed the body of a woman, and that too cost money — unless you were married to it. Within two weeks Cyrus had wooed, wedded, bedded, and impregnated her. His neighbors did not find his action hasty. It was quite normal in that day for a man to use up three or four wives in a normal lifetime.  
  
...  
  
> He was a conservative, not only in politics but in everything. Ideas he found revolutionary, and he avoided them with suspicion and distaste.  
  
...  
  
> She had no experience with men save only her husband, and that she looked upon as a tiresome and sometimes painful duty.  
  
...  
  
> “Well, sir, he raised one fine crop — he had good children and he raised them fine. All doing well — maybe except Joe. Joe — he’s the youngest — they’re talking about sending him to college, but all the rest are doing fine.”  
  
...  
  
> Samuel rode lightly on top of a book and he balanced happily among ideas the way a man rides white rapids in a canoe. But Tom got into a book, crawled and groveled between the covers, tunneled like a mole among the thoughts, and came up with the book all over his face and hands.  
  
...  
  
> Only the poor were lazy. Just as only the poor were ignorant. A rich man who didn’t know anything was spoiled or independent.  
  
...  
  
> Charles never spent a dime. He pinched a dollar until the eagle screamed.

I try not to have a single favourite book because my tastes and opinions keep evolving, but...East of Eden would come pretty close.

Grapes of Wrath is always touted at Steinbeck's best work, but for me personally, East is the most 'complete' of Steinbeck's work in its ability to capture his wit, his spirit, his gift for language and his ability to create nuanced characters with SO many facets to their personality. On top of that, it reads like both a love letter and a historic record of Steinbeck's beloved Salinas and its communities. 

It's a rare, special book ❤️",""

I don't see why it's such a massive revelation about the human condition that if you stick a group of immature, spiteful people together they'll be awful to each other but actually it doesn't have to be that way. *Wuthering Heights* is in this same vein for me.

"lqn3ues","zo0ombot","2024-10-06 16:59:43 UTC","My guess is that Grapes of Wrath is pretty commonly taught in American high school curriculums as a ""classic"" so they're immediately uninterested, whereas people stumble upon and are surprised by East of Eden out of their own volition so it feels more personal. Also East of Eden is intentionally set up by Steinbeck as this universal parable/story of humanity, while Grapes of Wrath is more personal and focused.

But as Cab says I don't want to be a *solid bringer-downer;* nothing ruins a good cryptolect like hearing old folks use it.

Btw, if you're having trouble with the older terms, Cab Calloway's *Hepster's Dictionary* (1938) may be helpful:

It brought tears to my eyes, chills to my skin, and a deep kind of introspection that I don’t think any other book has come close to creating. It took me over a year to read, but it was worth  every second and I cannot recommend it enough.","lqlcycj"

"lqkp9ff","interactually","2024-10-06 05:17:13 UTC","Certain translations of the Bible essentially order man to triumph over sin, while others say man will surely (""thou shalt"") triumph over sin. But the Hebrew translation uses ""timshel,"" or ""thou mayest."" 

This means, essentially,  man has a choice. People aren't wholly good and they're not wholly evil; you can choose what you do.

This is important for a character like Cal, who thinks he's a bad person, but his brother Aron is everything he's not. Cal doesn't have to resign himself to being a bad person, he can choose to be good. You can always be redeemed.","lqkii6e"
"lqkqqm7","Bouche_Audi_Shyla","2024-10-06 05:30:55 UTC","I don't remember which English translation is which, and it's been 35+ years since I've read the book.

When God speaks to Cain (after he killed Abel), in the two translations Samuel knew, God either said ""do thou rule over sin"", which is a straight order (thus removing Cain's free will) or ""thou shalt rule over sin"", which is a promise of success (again removing Cain's free will). 

The verb in question, in Hebrew, is timshel. Lee asked the Chinese elders their opinion. The elders, realizing the importance of this passage, studied Hebrew so that they might answer correctly.

The elders came to the conclusion that timshel actually means ""thou mayest"". It's Cain's choice whether to sin or not. We are given the choice.","lqkii6e"
"lqkvq5c","MaidenlessRube","2024-10-06 06:20:05 UTC","Here is Lee talking about it

>!""The American Standard translation
 ‘Do Thou,’ ...You must'
Orders man to triumph over sin, and you can call sin ignorance.!<

>!The King James translation makes a promise in
 ‘Thou shalt,’ 
meaning that men will surely triumph over sin.!<

>!But the Hebrew word, the word timshel 
— ‘Thou mayest’ — that gives a choice.
 It might be the most important word in the world. 
That says the way is open.
 That throws it right back on you.!<

>!""Now, there are many millions who in their sects and churches who feel the order, 'do thou' and throw their weight into obedience.!<

>!And there are millions more who feel predestination in 'Thou shalt.' Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be.!<

>!But 'Thou mayest'
Why, that makes a man great, 
that gives him stature with the gods, 
for in his weakness and his filth 
and his murder of his brother 
he has still the great choice.!<

>!He can choose his course and fight it through and win.
This is not theology. I have no bent towards the gods. 
But I have a new love for that glittering instrument, 
the human soul. It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe. 
It is always attacked and never destroyed, because 'Thou mayest.'""...!<","lqkii6e"

"lqkub42","Own-Animator-7526","2024-10-06 06:06:11 UTC","Actually, guessing meanings from context is problematic even in one's first language; especially when the transparent reading of a simple phrase is incorrect.  People often get incorrect meanings they have guessed from context stuck in their heads (case in point -- I think -- is Gen Z's use of *literally*).

Two interesting open-access papers on the problem of guessing for lexical acquisition:

* [The lexical plight in second language reading: words you don't know, words you think you know and words you can't guess](https://www.academia.edu/10234906/The_lexical_plight_in_second_language_reading_words_you_dont_know_words_you_think_you_know_and_words_you_cant_guess)  Batia Laufer 1997, In Second Language Vocabulary Acquisition: a Rationale for Pedagogy, eds. J. Coady and T. Huckin. Cambridge University Press. pp. 20-34.

It’s not about reading comprehension because that information was not given. This is missing cultural context that wasn’t provided, so the commenter you were rude to provided it.

"lqn7auf","rogerdoesnotmeanyes","2024-10-06 17:18:02 UTC","Interesting that you assume I had cultural context for it. I didn’t. I meant what I said about reading comprehension. It sounds vaguely familiar so I suppose maybe I’ve seen it before, but I don’t actually remember it, I just took the meaning from context. And if I hadn’t then I would have taken five seconds and googled it instead of writing an annoyed comment about how I didn’t get it. But it was pretty obvious hyperbole for being emotional, made even more obvious when reading the rest of what OP wrote. 

The sarcastic reference to 1984 from the commenter I replied to was certainly not necessary, if you want to talk about being rude. Their comment was not merely providing cultural context, they just were a dick to OP for using a phrase they didn’t immediately understand. ","lqm0bxz"

I made a sarcastic comment in reply to the person being an asshole about the existence of a phrase they had never heard. And I’m happy to own that I was being a little dickish in response to someone else doing the same, but I merely met them where they were, I didn’t escalate anything.
