The cover on the design led me to believe that the edition was from the 90s or early 2000s (there was no date in the book), yet the hard cover seemed really sturdy and clean and none of the pages had yellowed, which means the paper must be very good quality. I've seen books that were less old with incredibly yellowed pages (which I really hate). It's rare to find an old book that's in such a good condition, everytime I look at those shelves I think in horror about all the paper waste that books that no one cares about anymore generate. I really enjoyed the book too, it was my first time reading Daphne de Maurier and I love her writing style. I'm really glad I found it and very thankful to the previous owner for keeping it in such a good condition. I know that none of my books would be in such good condition,  since I often read while eating or drinking coffee.

One literacy-focused non-profit I worked at  got boxes upon boxes of crappy (as far as I could tell) books dropped off on a weekly basis (we didn't ask for donations), and they ended up in the recycling while the donors had no idea, and thought they were helping with literacy in some way.

I have the Female Man btw! I'll bump that up my list if you recommend it","lptt317"

"lpz6efi","coolestdudette","2024-10-02 13:59:12 UTC","okay that sounds like an interesting author! when you say historical fiction, how accurate is he in his writing to the actual history of the area he writes about?","lpue1cd"

They were selling the original paintings of many Sci-fi pulp novels as well as Star Trek and Star Wars books. They were signed by the artist and came with authenticity documents from the publishers. Some were priced in the thousands.","lpvzcud"

"lpza4kl","142Ironmanagain","2024-10-02 14:20:46 UTC","Michener has been gone for a while now, but his books are thoroughly & extensively researched and include real events, many times maps are included, usually peppered with fictitious and real characters. In the introductions and addendums to his books, many times he cites what’s real, and what’s not. Sometimes even names of towns are fictitious but based on real towns. But if you check his output, he’s written more than 40 books (!), both fiction and non-fiction!!","lpz6efi"
