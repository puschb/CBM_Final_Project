“Well, have you considered just murdering them all?”

“Don’t be absurd… Of *course* I have, that’s literally the first thing I thought of, but I don’t think it will work. No matter how I look at it, there’s just too many of them for me to murder alone. Man, I really wish Dad was here.”

The opposite of funny isn’t serious. It’s un-funny. People think if you’re serious you can’t be funny and if you’re funny you can’t be serious. Books can be serious and funny at the same time.  

Just as people tend to treat Dickens and Austen and Joyce as “Serious” and are then supprised when they are funny, I think people get the reverse with Discworld.

With Shakespeare, like many people I had to rediscover him on my own after high school (on my own meaning with really good editions of his works). High school taught Shakespeare in probably the worst way possible.

Pride and prejudice is straight up satire and it’s hilarious. 

Shakespeare is really interesting because it’s written super contextually based on who was in the audiences. So there are a lot of super low brow jokes for the poor people in the pit. 

But I think this happens in other places. Like wuthering heights is a pretty great horror novel. But people insist on taking it exceptionally seriously.

EDIT: I found it and it was even better than I remember.

One of the sailors (Stubb) orders the cook to lean over the side of the boat and tell the sharks down below (whom are nibbling at the whale carcass they ship is hauling) to eat more quietly and behave more civilly. The cook gets so into it that he delivers a whole sermon to the sharks about rising above their nature to be better behaved, whilst the Stubb alternately encourages him or tells him off for being too harsh on the sharks (""I won't have that swearing. Talk to 'em gentlemanly."")

That whole chapter is a delight. Below is another favourite bit:

""I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales.
