They talk about their lives in the 1930's and leading up to what came next. You can find it as a [PDF](https://ratical.org/PandemicParallaxView/TheyThoughtTheyWereFree-Mayer1955.pdf). If you only read part of it, read chapter 13.

It's utterly terrifying, not because it's a book about monsters, but it's a book about the complacency of people in the face of the slow trudge towards facism and the atrocities in the '40's.

"lwvlwls","spinningcolours","2024-11-13 06:01:51 UTC","Callback to an article about a paper written in 2020: 

The paper also shows that “influenza deaths of 1918 are correlated with an increase in the share of votes won by right-wing extremists, such as the National Socialist Workers Party” in Germany’s 1932 and 1933 elections.

Together, the lower spending and flu-related deaths “had a strong effect on the share of votes won by extremists, specifically the extremist national socialist party” — the Nazis — the paper posits. “This result is stronger for right-wing extremists, and largely non-existent for left-wing extremists.”

I believe this is a bit of a defense mechanism. Many people like to believe that the rise of fascism (and the destruction that followed) was an uniquely evil event that can never be replicated, and that similar atrocities can never happen again. 
But unfortunately, I don’t think that’s true. Dictatorships, ethnic cleansing and genocides are still happening today. 

When you look at it objectively a lot of factors that contributed to the rise of fascism are happening now too. Inflation, poverty, xenophobia, war, and anxiety about changing social norms, it’s all happening. 
Europe is experiencing a huge right-wing wave. And while I hesitate to call most of them fascists, the step from fascism often isn’t as far as people might think.

It’s comfortable to dismiss the possibility of a fascist threat, but it’s dangerous too. The dangers of fascism remain present and by not taking it seriously we give it the opportunity to rise undisturbed. 

I often think about the following quote, from the poem “O Germany, Pale Mother!” by Bertolt Brecht:

Apart from the gut-wrenching Holocaust survivor's story, I think it's fascinating how Art ties his relationship with his father (as well as his own nueroses) into everything Vladek went through. How profoundly his mother's suicide affected him, and how he seemed to blame that on the Holocaust.  It's as much a story about surviving being a child of Holocaust survivors as it is actually surviving the Holocaust. 


One of my favorite moments is when Art and Françoise are out on the porch discussing Vladek's latest story, and the mosquitos come out and start biting them.

Everybody always kneejerks and compares the rise of any potential Western demagogue to Hitler, because that's the literal worst scenario that could be repeated.

It starts with discord, then radicalization of a part of the populace, and ultimately a takeover by those people and the imposition of their rule on the rest of the people. This is not unique to Hitler. It's just how these things always go. Germany was not different from Iran in that sense.

"lwxescc","TheMadFlyentist","2024-11-13 15:19:40 UTC","Definitely agree that Trump is not Hitler, not even close, but there is one rather glaring parallel:

Hitler's rise was possible in large part because Germany was so heavily downtrodden and punished after WW1. The historically proud German people were looking for some sort of rallying cry - some strong leader to pull them out of the slump and return them to their former glory.

What Trump has arguably been most successful at is convincing his base that the USA is not great and needs to be made ""great again"". Whereas Hitler used the Jews as a scapegoat for all of the nation's problems, Trump blames the democrats while simultaneously inflating the issues and full-on lying about the actual state of things. He is a fearmonger who preys on people who are uneducated and not wealthy to convince them that an outside entity (the Dems/the migrants/the Muslims/etc) are coming to destroy their way of life. 

Because he has no morals, he is excellent at creating boogeymen out of thin air and then blaming Democrats for it, which his base eats up. Trump's lasting legacy will not be his tariffs or his Muslim/transgender bans, but his ability to sow discord and tribalism in a way we haven't seen since pre-civil war times.","lwvt917"

The pandemic was in full force, vaccines were only just rolling out, and millions still dying during the 2020 election. Trump told his people not to vote, amidst other chaos. 

Summary from that long reddit post:   
""Pandemics, as history shows, don’t just kill people—they can also weaken democratic institutions, amplify social divisions, and open the door for authoritarianism. Understanding the connections between past pandemics and political shifts is crucial to ensuring that today’s crises don’t repeat history.""

Given today's faster communication technologies, seeing a reactionary rise of the right in only 4 years is not unreasonable.

It's also striking that the Politico article says, ""The paper’s findings are likely due to “changes in societal preferences” following the 1918 outbreak, Blickle argues — suggesting the influenza pandemic’s disproportionate toll on young people may have “**spurred resentment of foreigners among the survivors**” and driven voters to parties “whose platform matched such sentiments.”

But then I thought that events on Jan 6th should - in my view - have caused most moderate people to take a step back and say 'woah... this is too much... what are we coming to?', but here we are. You could probably have said the same about convictions, level and tone of discourse... the list goes on.

So I ask myself 'what can I do?' and I try to focus on that. I'm lucky insofar that I'm not living in the US. But I do live in Warsaw, Poland, so my safety is probably only temporary.

You could reach out to libraries, advocate groups, anything you are passionate about really. Look at your skills, knowledge and experience. There's probably a group in need of an extra pair of hands to help out somewhere.
