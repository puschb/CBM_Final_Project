Dauphine**\n\nI struggle with stories of people who risk their own bodies by taking on big physical challenges. I am so enraged by the wasted life and vigorous health or even the risk of that waste that I can't muster much sympathy for the derring-doers. I'd hoped this one would give me a little more insight into the mindset of the Everest climbers, the extreme hikers, the bull runners, (*Chris McCandless*)  and so on. The title references the note that Largay left before her death due to starvation and exposure after becoming lost in the Maine wilderness, and the whole book hinted at the pages and pages of journals that she kept. Given those details, I'd hoped to read some of her writing and get a chance to see ... I don't know, some sympathetic aspect of her story. Instead, it seems like most of her papers are kept privately, which I have no problem with, except for the uncomfortable sense that her family was likely not involved in the writing and the letdown when it turned out to be just another exercise in getting pissed about people putting themselves in extreme situations, especially when they are romanticizing the experience and may or may not be fully prepared.\n\n#",

I think all four sisters are dull and insipid (And Marmee would be sickening even if her daughters called her by a name that didn't sound whiny), but Jo is the worst for being so insufferably full of herself. Her stupid writing outfit fills me with rage. The stupid thing with the gloves and the curl and the scorched dress fills me with rage. The limes make me angry. The jam that will not gel makes me angry. Professor Bhaer and the Boys School is the Worst. Ending. Ever.",
