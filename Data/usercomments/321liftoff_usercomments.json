It\u2019s all life sucks and everyone hates me with no real nuance or deeper emotional underpinnings.\n\nI\u2019ve come to realize that a lot of people like what I call pain porn. You see it a lot in fanfics too. I am not one of them.",

Maybe the kid needs to read a manual to build a model. Maybe it\u2019s a magazine about cars. Maybe it\u2019s a comic or graphic novel. Maybe it\u2019s tips and tricks for a favored video game. All of these things are legitimate reading. \n\nThe point here is once he has motivation to read, he can learn to read even if what he\u2019s reading isn\u2019t educational. After he learns to read, educational reading is possible. Or more likely, he can find books he likes that are also considered educational.",
