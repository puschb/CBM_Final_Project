None of the characters, none of the stories, I found it all so uninteresting. \n\nI don't mean to say it was the worst book i ever read, just the worst I made myself finish. I read it waiting for it to get better and live up to the hype. But i found myself wishing it would just end and it never did, it just kept going. I wish i had just quit. \n\nI understand that people love it, but I loathed it.",
