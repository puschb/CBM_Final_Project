And it just expands from there.\nThen there's reading books written in English by authors from other countries. From doing that you learn that the British word for elevator is lift, that when the Irish say give it a miss they mean I'll skip that, etc.\nYES, you can learn so much about the world and the different cultures and attitudes that show in the way they speak.
