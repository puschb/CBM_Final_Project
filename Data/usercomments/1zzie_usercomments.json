        "body": "Thanks for changing the tone of the conversation/clarifying. I forgot to mention that the US court system right now says [AI content cannot receive copyright protection](https://www.reuters.com/legal/ai-generated-art-cannot-receive-copyrights-us-court-says-2023-08-21/), so AI companies don't own the \"art\". That's the law right now. \n\nBut I'll leave you with this question about the AI unicorn case use, cancer. Even though we know some colors in food give cancer, companies are still allowed to sell them in the US (not in Europe). What do we need AI in medicine for if US society refuses to stop giving its people cancer? We could lower cancer rares for so many things already, we already know what causes it, prevention knowledge is already here, we don't need to wait for the future. \n\nInstead, the focus on treatment is because that would be profitable. Some company might create a pill or vaccine or whatever, hurray! (?) but... 99% of the population won't be able to buy it anyway as things stand right now. And that's a big if, whether we'd even get to such a medical threshold. And it's not impossible that humans couldn't find it without AI. \n\nBut yeah, I'm an anti-ai hype humanist so I can't put my faith on it for a  promise even if somehow healthcare resource distributions were somehow fixed.",

        "body": "Art copyright is an extremely niche form of law and  some people do argue that you can't own the ideas and copyright should be deeply limited or even terminated. Of course artists own the objects they create (e.g. a physical canvas), but it's not like Pollock would or could sue anyone else doing paint splashes. So in that sense no, once you put it out there, art is free to inspire people and you can't own the future possibility of your technique or art being used by someone else. AI firms are trying to build private property on the commons. Machines should work for people, people should not work for machines. \n\nIt doesn't really sound like you want to have a good faith argument, since your answer to lots of points is \"so what\" and then you complain one point of view isn't self evident. If anything was self evident you wouldn't need it explaining it to you, so that's a even weirder dismissing tactic. \n\n\n This is basically how you're acting \ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude48  that's disingenuous and boring \u270c\ufe0fso I'm not even gonna bother explaining why throwing all of human endeavor under the bus for the promise of **maybe** curing cancer is \"worth it\".",

Besides, AI is derivative by definition. Generative AI is a marketing concept, it is predicting based on past data, at best it should be thought of as a form of remix but it cannot innovate the way humans make remix art because it doesn't think, can't be inspired, etc because it's fundamentally just a mathematical algorithm. Only humans think and create art as part of a social exchange.",
