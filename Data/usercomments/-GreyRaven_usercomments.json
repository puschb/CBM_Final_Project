People have pointed out how it takes a lot of inspiration from series like ACOTAR and Red Queen, and it's really apparent when they follow the same story beat-for-beat.\n\nEDIT: I don't think there's even an inherent problem with stories being predictable or formulaic, because they can still be enjoyable, but Fourth Wing just wasn't for me at the end, especially because it doesn't really do anything new or interesting with the tropes it includes.",

The one thing I will say in it's defense is that I think a lot of these decisions do kinda fall under the \"it's soft worldbuilding\" umbrella, so theoretically rule of cool would apply and it wouldn't really matter, if, the big if, it was sufficiently awesome that it didn't matter that it made no sense. Like how popcorn flicks are often full of plot holes but who cares because there was a big explosion and that was awesome!\n\nI get that, and some people like it just for pure vibes or the aesthetics, which is fine. Different readers look for different things in books. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n>That said, I didn't like it enough to give it a pass either. It bothered me as well that they just killed people off left and right even though its a massive waste of resources. Like, even if a cadet wouldn't make a good rider, militaries need other positions too y'know? If nothing else somebody needs to clean the toilets and pick up the charred remains of stupid cadets. \n\nRight?! And there are two other non-active combat squadrants in the same college, so it's not like they don't already have options? Why not retrain failed rider cadets to be healers or scribes instead?\n\n\n>I didn't connect with the human characters, I only moderately liked the dragons, I didn't like people getting killed off for stupid reasons, there wasn't enough fun charming world building stuff that I really like, there was not enough actual romance to go with the sexual tension. \n\nThe dragons were pretty much the only thing I consistently liked, and even then, I specifically liked Tairn and his characterization as a grumpy old man who liked to dunk on Violet from time to time. I really wish we'd gotten more of that instead of whatever pseduo love triangle nonsense we got with Dain and Xaden. \ud83d\ude44",
