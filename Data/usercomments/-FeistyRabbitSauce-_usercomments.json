Maybe even a little fucked up *on the face of it*.\n\nI reconciled with it like this - wouldn't it be neat to travel back and meet your current spouse at different times in their life before you knew them? Like, I think my wife is one of the coolest people, and it'd be fascinating to spend short moments with who she used to be. And that's pretty much what Henry does in the book, albeit through no real choice of his own. \n\nWith that said, the story and the characters do address it the elephant in the room, at least a bit. I recall it being a concern for Henry a couple of times. Clare loves him directly because of his existence throughout her life, but (iirc) he isn't even aware of this until they're already married, and he goes back there for the first time. This is far from the central plot or conflict in the novel, but it does come up a bit. And a \n\nThe story also has much more to it. A big aspect is how his interfering sort of constructed her whole life without her say in the matter. I dont want to spoil it by saying much more, but i think you won't be disappointed. I say keep going.",

Really, though, he didn't believe in it himself, but the boy did. The boy teaches him that that fire is real when they meet the old man - there are people who are still good in the world aside from them, and they must have hope. It's for this reason, and out of desperation, that the father has hope his son will be okay. That the family who has been following them are good people, that they too carry the fire.",
