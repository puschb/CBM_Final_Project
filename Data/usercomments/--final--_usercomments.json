There are books that have so many words that are new to me that i could spend more time looking them up in the dictionary than reading. But I pick the ones that are hardest to guess (check the context, the root) and then let the rest go. This way I'm actually more likely to remember the meaning of the four or five new words I learn than if I were to look up 25 words a day.",

I read it when I was quite young and it blew my mind.\n\nIt sparked my interest in philosophy at a time when I really thought I wanted nothing to do with it. The book has its critics (some find the author smug or feel he muddles things), but I think it's one of the best ways to introduce people to philosophical thinking without overwhelming them with names and theories. Once you know more philosophy,",
