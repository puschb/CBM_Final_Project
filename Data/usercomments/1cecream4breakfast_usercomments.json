I was there for the fairy tale. \n\nI haven\u2019t read Firefly Lane because I thought the show dragged on too much and didn\u2019t have much going on, plot wise. I still liked it but didn\u2019t feel compelled to read the book. Which main character died in the book? In the TV series it was >!Kate!<. Did they pull a My Sister\u2019s Keeper with the ending?\n\nI read Night Road and hated it \ud83d\ude02\n\nShe is a must read for me now, because she\u2019s found her niche with historical fiction. She writes great relationships and paints a scene really well. Sometimes too well with the outfit descriptions lol. I think why I liked Winter Garden was because the part I liked was basically >!historical fiction!<.",

So it\u2019s not that only bad *books* get popular, it\u2019s that genres I don\u2019t like are popular. I really tend not to like many books set in the present day, unless they really stay away from cell phones and social media and all of that. I want to read a book and not necessarily know when exactly it\u2019s taking place, unless it\u2019s set around a specific time period on purpose, like WWII historical fiction. \n\nSometimes contemporary fiction/chick lit is fine because it is an easy read, but they are not always quick because they don\u2019t pull me in.",

Jenna Fischer (actress, co-host of podcast) said she called her provider and made them switch it back, because she wants it for emergencies. 911 can tell where you are calling from on a landline even if your power is out, but only if on a copper line. They are becoming a thing of the past. If anyone has a landline for emergencies, look into this!",
