        "body": "This is a problem I've specifically noticed in some of the types of communities where you'd see this type of book discussed. \"social justice\" type of communities (if there's a better name for them now let me know.) I used to spend a lot of time in them and in mental health ones that were full of the same people and took that same lean. It's hard to explain, but so often people's pain and anger was prioritized above all. So if something offended anyone, and they put up a big enough stink about it, any attempt at nuanced discussion was seen as some sort of attack, and you're usually silenced by being called some kind of bigot. \n\nI grew up evangelical christian, and I ended up having to leave these spaces when it became clear they operated in the same puritanical way. \n\nAll that to say that I don't think this is a *general* reading comprehension issue. I think with subject matter like this, the type of people that are attracted to it are often traumatized people that don't know how to operate outside of their emotional reactions to triggers, and often don't want to learn. They lean into their feelings as a guidance of what is morally right and wrong, and therefore their interpretation that the book is war crime apologist material is not up for debate.\n\nI have seen and had good discussions about this book, but generally these conversations don't happen on reddit because reddit is an extremely adversarial atmosphere. Outside of reddit they are still difficult to find because of the stuff I mentioned already. The people that are triggered are usually the loudest and most intolerant of any other interpretations, and it can be hard to fight back against that when they are using shame and manipulation to get other people to fall in line with them. (IE: if you like this book you're a war crime apologist)",
