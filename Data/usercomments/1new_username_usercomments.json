I have no issues with the Bible being taught in a world religions or world history or even English literature, as long as it is being given proper context along other similar works (Qur'an, etc).\n\nI find that using Bible stories as reading excerpts for elementary aged children is an extremely thinly veiled attempt at Christian indoctrination. There are plenty of resources/stories/etc specifically designed by professionals for those specific ages that we don't need the stories of the Bible to fill any gaps.",
