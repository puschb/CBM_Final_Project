We had to strip the covers & first 20 or so pages off the mass market paperbacks before throwing them away (to prevent dumpster divers from retrieving them.) often we stripped/threw away books as soon as we unpacked them because our store was on the smaller side & the corporation sent the same amount of books to all stores or something.
