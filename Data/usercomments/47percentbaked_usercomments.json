As someone who struggles with mental health issues, I could relate to his character more than most characters I was reading about around the same time. Yes he uses a lot of repetitive statements and he\u2019s maybe kind of a jerk at times, but the kid has had a lot of bad happen to him. And he\u2019s broken. \n\nThe fact that he\u2019s recapping it all from inside a hospital/institution makes it all the more real for me. I\u2019m sure middle aged Holden would be embarrassed of some of the things he said or did when he was a teenager but it doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t true to his emotional state at the time. \n\nPlus Salinger is a fantastic writer, in my opinion.",
