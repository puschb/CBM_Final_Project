        "body": "The tale of \u201cBisclavret\u201d by Marie de France is a 12th century story about a werewolf. Basically a baron turns into a werewolf and his wife doesn\u2019t like this so she steals his clothes so he can\u2019t change back into human form. Stuck in werewolf form the baron is caught by the king (his former friend). As a werewolf he \u201clays\u201d close to the king and kisses his feet and leg. The king and werewolf are inseparable. There\u2019s definitely some sexual tension between the king and the werewolf. Had to think about this story because of the question. I think lycanthropy has been used as a vehicle to describe \u201cnon-normative\u201d behavior.",
