I loved to shoot pool and play darts, but I don\u2019t like to drink, so when everyone got sick of playing and turned to drinking instead, I\u2019d get bored and either whip out a book or a crochet project.\n\nOne night, I was reading at a table in a quiet corner while everyone else was up at the bar. The place we were in was part of a larger building that had a bowling alley and a pool hall for tournaments, so the smaller bar area was always pretty quiet, but especially on tournament nights, which it happened to be. After like 30 minutes of reading, some guy a lot older than me (and definitely tipsier) came up and started picking on me. He was saying comments along the line of \u201cyou come to a bar just to read?\u201d And then laughing. My partner had gone to the bathroom and the only one still at the bar at the time was one of his friends\u2019 girlfriends who was already sloshed, so she just thought it was funny. He was just trying to be friendly though and we ended up all sitting up at the bar for a while listening to him tell random stories.",

There were good moments, but I felt like the best moments were at the front half of the book to the end of the Sloosha's Crossing section, and everything after was mostly unnecessary or detracted from the stories they were continuing. It was a huge bummer because I really liked Robert Frobisher's story most of all up to the end.

You\u2019re right that the disease presents very differently for everyone. It\u2019s been ages since I\u2019ve read it, maybe I\u2019d change my mind if I read it again, but I remember having some major concerns about the depiction or plot points from midway through to the end.

The book featured a lot of generalizations of what Alzheimer\u2019s looks like to make for an exciting story because the reality can be significantly more mundane.\n\nFor example, in my time on that unit specifically, I had probably close to 75 different residents in varying stages of disease progression (some, not many, were only in for PT after an injury and behaved otherwise pretty normal aside from needing a higher level of care and reorientation to date and time). Most incontinence in the early stages that we saw came from losing bladder control with age or inability to ambulate or transfer from a chair to a toilet at will. That part where Alice is panicking and has an accident because she can\u2019t remember where the bathroom is was bordering absurd. It could maybe happen, sure, but it\u2019s not likely in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s that you\u2019d forget where the bathroom is in a summer home you\u2019ve owned for several years (which I believe was the context of where the scene occurred). The cognitive changes/failings that come with Alzheimer\u2019s/Dementia and the pain of Alice\u2019s family as their loved one\u2019s disease progresses throughout the book were dead on, but they were surrounded by too many tropes to add dramatic flair.\n\nThere were other gripes I had about it plot-wise, but it\u2019s been just shy of a decade since I read it, so I don\u2019t remember most of them. I liked the movie a little better because they casted some great matches for the characters, but even that just felt too unrealistically dramatic. And it\u2019s sad too because I saw a lot of residents who had truly heartbreaking stories that deserved to be heard and connected to, and Still Alice misses the mark in a big way.",

        "body": "Definitely stick with reading 2 and 3 star reviews for the more honest opinions. 1 and 5 star reviews are usually pretty biased, and people like me who rarely rate a book at 5 stars also abuse 4 star reviews often too lol\n\nPersonally, I write reviews 100% for myself though. I read quite a bit and am a little forgetful, so when I see a book on my shelf and I'm not sure if I've already read it or what I thought of it, it's helpful to go back and read my review to see if it would be a good reread. But some of them have gotten lengthy because I had big opinions, so I'm definitely one of those pretentious people... ope lol",
