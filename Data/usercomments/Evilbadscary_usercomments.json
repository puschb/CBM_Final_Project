        "body": "It needs to be something he's already interested in. My son at that age HATED reading, but loved Halo and all the Halo games. So, I found Halo books lol. There's graphic novels for just about any subject you can think of, which helps keep their interest while encouraging reading.\n\nTBh we also used video games as his currency. He was only allowed to play on the weekends, so he had to \"earn\" playing time during the week by reading for his homework or just for 30 mins/night. Nothing insane, but it motivated him to read even when he didn't want to lol.\n\nFWIW he's an entire adult now and loves to read and will talk books with me for hours, so it really is just a phase for some kids, they are totally resistant to reading for some reason.\n\nETA: I'd also try audiobooks where he can \"read\" along, it  might help him make the word/story association. But I'd make sure he's been evaluated for anything that could be making him struggle. I speak from a place of experience with a resistant/reluctant reader who had no delays or issues that would cause it, but know that's not always the case.",
