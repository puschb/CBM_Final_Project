I got into horror as an adult, mainly because I enjoy weird fiction and I find horror/pulp explores a lot of themes I find interesting (identity, trauma, existential dread, etc.). However, very little in horror literature is actually worse than the stuff I see on a regular basis in healthcare and read about in the news. If anything, most horror comes across a bit naive to me. It\u2019s a bit of an escape if anything. Granted, I\u2019m not reading splattercore or whatever.",
