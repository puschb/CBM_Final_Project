She explained that Aron had always pictured her as a \"perfect\" person ever since they met as children.  She knew she could never live up to the mental image that Aron held of her and it was causing her some stress.  She had years to think about this and figure it out.  Then when she realized herself to be a woman, she made the rational decision to drop him, at least mentally and emotionally.  Their relationship was not unlike the worship that Adam had for Kate (Cathy).  He couldn't see the real person, he could only see and relate to the image he held of her, which was the opposite of her true nature.  I guess Aron, being Adam's son, followed the same line of thinking with Abra, except Abra was a good person, not evil like Kate.",
