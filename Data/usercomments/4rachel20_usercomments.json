Now, I get up with my alarm and I plop myself with a book when I am doing my morning pee. Sure I have brain fog for like the first page, but then I get excited about the storyline again and it wakes me up gradually. I read for 30 minutes, and refuse to look at my phone. Since I've done this waking up has been easier, I don't feel as tired as I did before, and I get a whole lot more reading done!!",
