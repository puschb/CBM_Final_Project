I even took notes as I was reading, just to keep a bunch of the names straight. There are several kind of separate sections and stories, some of which are expanded elsewhere as you referenced. It does help explain some of the mythology and references in the main lotr story, and it certainly helps you contextualize Middle Earth in the larger picture that Tolkien envisioned. It largely focuses on the history of the Elves, and their dealings with the *Valar*. To me it helped emphasize the implicit meaning behind many of the secondary and tertiary aspects of the LOTR. The two main reasons It's not easy to read are that it is written in slightly archaic language, and that it's really a collection of narratives that are only partially connected in some cases.",

A friend had recommended that I read it, and told me that I would not be disappointed, so I gave it a shot. It's a beautiful story, and bears almost no resemblance to the old movie version that I had expected. The narrative structure is a bit complex, with multiple narrators, but in a way that helps the reader see at least parts of the whole story from those separate points of view. Given how long ago the book was written, it seems more impressive than if it was a more recent work.
