It\u2019s like I go into my own little world, in parallel to the narrator.\n\nI learned about maladaptive daydreaming and OCD. It turned out that a lot of my actions came from ruminating on \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios that I\u2019ve been constantly on edge for. I\u2019ve been doing ERP with my OCD specialist.

Rebecca seemed like she was awful to be married to, but there isn\u2019t any reflection from the narrator on the fact that her husband killed someone. Definitely reads as the narrator still being in a heightened state of shock, scared for her husband, and isn\u2019t able to process the gravity of it.\n\nAfter Maxim tells the narrator that he killed Rebecca he does seem to have removed the invisible wall between them. From Rebecca\u2019s boat being discovered to when they return to Manderley from London is a relatively short time for so much to happen. Outside of physical intimacy and helping the narrator get comfortable in the car, we don\u2019t really see any change of character. Both of those things benefit Maxim, but he doesn\u2019t show any selflessness towards his wife. Again - short timeline, everyone is in shock, racing around. But it doesn\u2019t give me hope of things actually improving. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting because we do see genuine kindness towards the narrator from Frank Crawley. There is definitely a parallel between how Maxim (upper class, husband) treats the narrator versus how Frank (lower class, employee turned friend) treats her.",
