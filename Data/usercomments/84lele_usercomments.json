But beyond that (cause finding out if he has those issues is only part of the battle) I would try getting him audio books and having him follow along with the audio books or getting a second copy of the book, you read most of it then occasionally have him read a line in his book.  Or maybe even just read a line back.  So you'd read a page and then ask him what part of that page he liked and have him read back that part.  Lean into the auditory assistance since he seems to do well with that just get him to do them in tandem and it will eventually click for him.",
