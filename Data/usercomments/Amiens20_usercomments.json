I\u2019d love to find a group that\u2019s friendly and supportive, where we can escape into the world of science fiction together. I\u2019m open to any kind of sci-fi reads! If anyone has recommendations for a relaxed, friendly book club (online) or if there\u2019s a group looking for new members, I\u2019d love to hear about it. Thanks in advance!",
