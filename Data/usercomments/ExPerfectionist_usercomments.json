YA story is action-packed, but writing is flat and boring and awful, protagonist is kind of insufferable, and there's no struggle bc he's so amazing and perfect at everything.\n\nThe Atlas Six series - barely anything happens, just a bunch of young stylish sexy people doing a lot of talking, in a magic / superpower group like the X-Men house if X-men were scientists. They also seem to all hate and love-hate each other, although maybe the intensity is partly due to the (over)acting of the VO narrators in the audio books.",
