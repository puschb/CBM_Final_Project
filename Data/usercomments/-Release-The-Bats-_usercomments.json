There's more to a book than that--things like plot and character are just as important in a compelling story as tropes. I love the fake dating trope, for example, but I'm not going to be into a fake dating story if it doesn't make sense for the characters to be in that kind of arrangement.\n\nUltimately I think that, now that BookTok is popularizing certain types of books, tropes are just on more people's radars and we're just seeing what that looks like.

(The book was published by MTV so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.) It was especially grating because it ended up being important to the plot. By the end of the book I was so annoyed that I ended up not wanting one.\n\nAside from this I don't really care about modern references. Maybe it dates the book but I don't see that as really being detrimental to the plot.",

If there's only positive reviews but no summary, then I won't read the book.\n\nRight now I'm going through the books I own and only reading the ones I haven't read yet because I have a lot of books and need to downsize. When I finish a book, I flip it around on my shelf so that the pages are showing. I specifically have two stacks of books next to my bed that I'm working through at the moment. One of those stacks is a bunch of books from my TBR that my boyfriend got me for Christmas. I didn't expect him to get me all the books on the list I gave him! Hahaha!\n\nSince I'm a writer, sometimes I'll read books similar to whatever project I'm working on as a way to research the genre. I try to be careful when I do this though so I don't accidentally end up writing something too similar to what I'm reading.\n\nIf it's specifically from my shelf, it's just whatever looks the most interesting. Sometimes it's one I've been meaning to get to for awhile but just haven't had the chance to yet because of whatever else I'm reading.",

Up until that point I\u2019d assumed it was set in generic pseudo-middle-ages Fantasyland, so it was jarring to see a character use a phrase me and my friends were saying back in high school.\n\nI\u2019ll stop reading a book if I learn they don\u2019t use quotation marks, whether they go with something else or just don\u2019t use anything. It\u2019s an annoying stylistic choice that usually makes no sense (the exception being *A Step From Heaven* because it distinguishes between the characters speaking English or Korean) and just serves to make the author look like they think they\u2019re more artsy/clever/creative than they really are.",
