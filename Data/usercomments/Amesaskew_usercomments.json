Dickens had a unique way of making you care about characters in desperate situations and I think he really reached the pinnacles of what he did best in this novel \n\nA Tree Grows in Brooklyn: Francie was the first character I ever really connected to. Francie was like me. She thought like me and had the same dreams and hardships ( though hers were much worse). Every time I reread it, I remember was it was like to be 11 years old again.\n\nSense and Sensibility: as much as I like Pride and Prejudice, I think this is a better story. Deeper. Colonel Brandon is a very complex character that I immediately had a crush on the first time I read the book.",

I went to see Pat Rothfuss, Jacqueline Carey, Les Grossman and John Scalzi. \n\nThe morning before the convention starts my husband and I go down to the hotel restaurant for breakfast. It's fairly crowded. A guy alone in a leather cowboy hat sits down at the next table. We start talking . Not about anything in particular, just the kind of random conversation you have with strangers in public. He seemed lonely and a bit awkward, but really nice. We thought he was just another conversation attendee.\n\nIt wasn't until we went to a panel later on in the day that I discovered we'd been hanging out with Brust.",
