Indeed, I\u2019d suggest that sometimes in the context of a discussion oriented setting that\u2019s actually slightly preferable as the participants don\u2019t assume they know and understand everything and are thus perhaps more receptive to the discussion. \n\nAlso, this was a time and in a part of the country without the flurry of book banning and dumbing down of non-STEM type education topics that we have been seeing in the last couple of decades.",
