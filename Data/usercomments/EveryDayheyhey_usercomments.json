I was recently re-reading my favorite book as a kid and it is all good except for one chapter where people blacken their faces to look like devils. The devil's are compared to Black Pete (a Dutch racist tradition that's finally fading out ) and \"bos negers\" the word neger in Dutch isn't like the n word in English but it would not be used today. Changing those things doesn't change the story telling and I think it would be fine to change them. Especially cause I think (hope) that kids that are born now will probably not understand what Black Pete is anyway.\n\n\n(The book is crude in jeans. The book is amazing. The movie is terrible )",
