And the turn-around time is so much shorter, and once again the metrics they have available are so much better.\n\nSecondly, just because we've been through many generations of \"this rots kids' brains!\" tech doesn't mean there hasn't historically been some element of truth for it.

As somebody (tried to) use that quote, I think it's fair to consider it in a vacuum.\n\nMy immediate thought on reading your comment is, yes it's more prevalent that people judge each other for consuming content from \"problematic\" sources, but also, I think that's an age-old problem and I don't think people truly care that much, or they might alternatively cut off people who disagree. It's clear that the way people react to these things has changed a lot over even the past decade, but also I'm still not sure if that's truly because of capitalism or consumerism.\n\nIf you asked me (without considering that essay) what I'd pin the blame on, I personally feel it's the way social justice has been used in recent years. I mean that as in, there are plenty of people trying to take the moral high ground by being, for example, the anti-racist then weaponize that in discussions: a lot of discrediting people for random things they've said 10 years ago, and \"if you argue with us you're racist\", and \"you're a straight white male so your opinion doesn't matter\". And I think corporations are exploiting these values for PR/marketing purposes, and they *don't* want to be the subject of those people's attention by putting some risky stuff in. And they're the ones who make all the shit we consume. The topic of sex, sexuality, and of course not-fully-consensual stuff is a hot one, and I think that's enough to make corporations want to play it extra safe, especially if they don't think including a sex scene will make them more money.\n\nSo, finally, I had given it a read and mainly I felt the connection between sex scenes *in particular* (as opposed to everything in general seen as \"unsafe\" from a corporate eye as I meant by the previous paragraph) and capitalism/consumerism was tenuous. *As far as I could tell,* there wasn't a very strong logical or evidence-based link between them. What does it mean if AAA movies aren't depicting sex if people still consume lots of porn? However, I don't really feel like I understood the author very well either at quite a lot of points. I'm just too bad at reading or the author wrote a bit too obtusely (personally not a fan of the writing style and couldn't tell if some stuff was jargon... but didn't care enough to look it up). Either way, while I feel like I disagree with lots of the author's points and the premise, I don't think I could make a proper argument about it.",

Not to say kids should be taught that hate speech great but rather, many people damn near get rabid if they get the idea another person is racist for example. See in discussions relating to racism, even if nobody says anything that is racist, inevitably someone will accuse someone of being racism and therefore their argument is inherently wrong.

I didn't read the books but in a setting without modern globalization, it's pretty notable if somebody alone has a different skin colour, or if a place manages to integrate people of different skin colours. Would Aragorn be the only black person or is their society very diverse? Lots of fantasy settings have been done where similar things are believable. But conveniently if you use some \"European\" architecture and land that looks \"European\", the audience needs no explanation when the people and culture look \"European\".\n\nAnd I doubt they had the resources that modern productions have in the days of Shakespeare, so that's already a pretty good reason they'd fit people into roles they didn't physically match.",
