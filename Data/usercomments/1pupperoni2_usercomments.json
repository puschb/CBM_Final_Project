GRRM talks about his characters like actual people - sometime they surprise him and take the story in different directions, which complicates the plot. \u00a0The DM comment is equally ridiculous - he provided the ending to the showrunners, who absolutely bungled reaching said ending. I\u2019d love Winds of Winter to see the light of day, but its delay doesn\u2019t undo everything he\u2019s accomplished to date.",
