The Where'd you go Bernadette narrator is VERY good with the exception of pronouncing 1:1 as one to one instead of one on one\n\n\nCurrently mad at the narrator for city of bones for flip flopping between British and American pronunciations. I understand the shadowhunters having a different accent from Clarey but the internal narration is so inconsistent",

I don't blame you \n\n\nFor hitchhikers guide the one thing I say that helps most people is that it's not supposed to make much sense. It's like Sci fi Alice and wonderland-- in the first book there's no strong character motivation in Arthur, our main focus, so we just kind of get dragged along through a weird tour of the universe. It feels random because it's supposed to be. That's the humor of it.",
