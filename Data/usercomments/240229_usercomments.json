She has her issues (the way she writes central Asians is a big one, as common an issue it is) but she has a wide array of works toying around with the genre tropes while incorporating contemporary commentary into them: making the morally gray master the main character (Faraway Wanderers), gender swap (Legend of Fei), modern au (No Pollution No Public Harm), critique of the cultivation system and genre as a whole (Tai Sui, my favourite), among others.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s more scifi, but Ken Liu has excellent short stories with elements of Chinese mythology: Good Hunting, The Litigation Master and the Monkey King, and All The Flavors I remember as having some sort of fantasy layer.\u00a0",
