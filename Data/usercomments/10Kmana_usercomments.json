I literally skimmed the Wikipedia for the plot, I had never read a word of his books, saw my ex play the videogame quite a bit, but that was IT. Got invited to the capital city to receive my prize and meet said author in this whole ceremonial thing. There I am, standing in front of a crowd of strangers and some press people taking photos, holding the diploma I got for interpreting this author's work, and shaking hands with the GUY WHO WROTE THAT WORK, when suddenly he leans in to say something to me. I tense up in anticipation, absolutely convinced that this is it, he's about to put me on the spot with some super specific question about his books that I won't be able to answer and expose me as a total fraud and an imposter in front of all these people; literally, my worst nightmare about to happen before my eyes and I am powerless to stop it at this point. I basically grind my teeth through my socially awkward frozen smile and ever so slightly lean towards him to hear what judgment he has to pass. And he says: \"I'm so sorry, but I didn't actually read your story\"\n\nTo this day I still wish I had said what was my first instinct to say to that: \"That's okay, I didn't actually read your book\". But really I just stood there in total shock because it was so ironic, my eyes must have been wide as saucers in those press photos\n\nOhhh... I have never had to fight to hold back laughing out loud so hard as in that moment. What karma was that?!",
