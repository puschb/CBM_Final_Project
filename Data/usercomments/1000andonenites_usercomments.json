For example, I understand that the consensus on how Twain uses the n-word in Huckleberry Finn is indeed that he is portraying how ppl of the time talk, and is critical of it, and he (Twain) is NOT being racist. I remember reading Huckleberry Finn, and I was appalled at lots of things happening in the book, but Twain being racist was not one of them. That's just an example. \n\n  With regards to Whose Body?, the general consensus seems to be that Sayers is not simply portraying \"how ppl were back then\", she is actively, as someone else said, portraying Jewish ppl as the Other, in a pretty crude, glaringly anti-Semitic way.  It's a lot, in this book. There are plenty of books from that era (and others) where hateful beliefs and expression of bigotry are not given forefront and centre position- even on this thread there are plenty of examples, and as folk said, it is at the end of the day up to each individual to determine what their boundaries are, what media they choose to consume, what makes them uncomfortable. I love love love the Narnia books, and they've had a huge impact on me, even though I'm an atheist, and I feel like all of my life I've been mourning the casual racism CS Lewis tosses about, especially in The Horse and His Boy, generally acknowledged to be the best. But, for me at least, the beauty and strength of the books eclipse that, and during a particularly stressful time, I found myself rereading Prince Caspian as comfort. I've repeatedly heard that \"Birth of a Nation\" is a masterpiece- if you ignore its sympathy for the Ku Klux Klan- and I won't watch it. I watched and read Gone with the Wind as a young adult, and even then I could pick up on the problematic racism (and sexism- not a fan of marital rape)- but I can understand its appeal and endurance. Whose Body? is not a particularly good story anyway- it's definitely not as good as some of other Sayers books- but I wouldn't have it censored or anything. \n\nFinally, I did misread your line about the lecture and Somerville- my apologies for that, I was typing at midnight, after a long day at work and Reddit(!).",

        "body": "Well, I do want to initiate and participate in a frank and open discussion about anti-Semitism both specifically in that book and in broader British literature of the time, and I succeeded in that. I do believe there is inherent value in such an activity since \u201cthrough dialogue we learn\u201d, and every bit of text and exchange has a certain amount of social significance and value attached. I think it is important to have these discussions, since until very recently, at least in my experience, British writing and culture is very much valourized and lauded. I did history in a British high school back in the nineties (called them A-levels then, no idea what it\u2019s called now) and the emphasis was wholly on the amazing role of Britain in WWII- nothing about British imperialism or atrocities or anti-Semitism. Britain carefully nurtures and promotes this image of itself as a nice quirky polite people (as opposed to Other, not-so-nice people). The needle is shifting only recently, as more awareness is gained about the devastation wrought by the British empire. \n\nOpen discussions such as this about the unsavoury parts of British society and history are necessary- I don\u2019t think they are \u201cjust\u201d about shaking your fist in the air. Also it\u2019s ok to vent about readings that make you upset or cringe.\n\nI have to add, I\u2019m not as virtuous as all that anyway \ud83d\ude43 the main reason I probably won\u2019t finish the book is that it\u2019s not particularly good. If it was an amazing story (eg like an AC or a better Sayer) I probably would have finished it. Death of the Author. \n\nAnd I completely agree with your point about education being a resource for the elite to maintain the status quo- although I think perhaps the Victorians were starting to dabble in more \u201cprogressive\u201d ideas about education, iirc.",

That's why Rhett was shunned and looked down upon by his own class and society. Not because he was feisty or sassy or married Scarlett. But because he was an immoral person who got rich(er) by engaging in activities which damaged their own side, and everyone knew that. That is what war profiteering does. Examples are plenty: British aristocrats selling crappy boots falling apart to their own government, for their own soldiers, etc, in WW1. It's not talked about as much, because who wants to hear that these outstanding elite members of society were scumbag profiteers and racketeers? No-one. Does no good for the morale.   \n\nSame goes for rape. The fact that they didn't have laws against it and it was perfectly legal doesn't say much when we're talking about a society where chattel slavery was also perfectly legal. As a society we always kinda sorta knew rape was awful (it's talked about in ancient classical texts- women kill themselves because of being raped, then and now), it just took us a reallllllly looooong time to make laws about it. And even now that we have, it seems like Certain People still haven't got the message. \n\nAnother modern televised depiction of marital rape is in Breaking Bad. The reception for that, and the way the woman is treated by the audience, is depressing. Feels like the more things change, the more they stay the same.",

They're arrogant, demanding, entitled, wealthy through unfair, immoral if not illegal means (I'm only guessing that about Heathcliff, but it's a safe guess, and yes, inherited aristocratic wealth is unfair and there's a good argument for considering it immoral), cold, rude, and have no hesitation pulling rank for their needs and interests.\n\nIn fact, the more I think about it, they're awful men and I am thankful there are none like that in my immediate social circle.",
