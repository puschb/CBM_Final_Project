So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the content you guys focus on! Lots of people out there are like me. What platforms do you guys advertise your book club on? \n\nI joined a book club just yours (met virtually) during Covid. I randomly stumbled on them via Instagram. It was so funny because it was a tight knit group of girls from northern UK and then me, some random chick from NYC who never met these girls ever before. They had a rly cool brand identity and displayed their current & past reads on their instagram so just from the profile I knew I was interested. You can have an account and grow organically by commenting on author\u2019s posts about their books. Leave reviews of books on your page, tag the author, maybe they\u2019d repost (happened to me and I fan girled so hard). This way you gain more reach and ppl hear about you! \n\nFunny enough, Dua Lipa (that famous pop singer of today) , has an incredible book club! I never gave her one thought nor did I listen to her music and care for her. Didn\u2019t even know she had a book club! But I heard about this book club on \u201cbook tok\u201d (TikTok accounts for book worms) and joined it, loved it, and later found out it was Dua Lipa\u2019s lol! Ofc since it\u2019s a celebrity book club, there\u2019s no actual meetings but they send emails 2x a month with content related to the book of the month as well as additional interesting articles. So that\u2019s another format to consider \n\nBasically I\u2019m thinking that, if you haven\u2019t already, you need to modernize the book club by using social media and technology more to your advantage! You can also utilize traditional methods and do word of mouth.",
