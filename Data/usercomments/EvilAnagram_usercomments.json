She's asking public institutions to become \"affiliates\" over a trademark dispute, which is nonsensical. If she had any representation, she would be asking them to apply for a license to use the trademarked term, which is all that's required.\n\nGenerally, when someone is reaching out personally and in such a weird way, they're not receiving legal representation. Frankly, I don't think she can afford to sue a bunch of libraries, so ignoring her is unlikely to yield consequences.\n\nAdditionally, her attempt to trademark the term \"Walk\" in regards to book clubs based around walking (and by claiming any similar terminology is too similar she is functionally doing just that) is so generic that it's unlikely to ever pass muster in court.\n\nAsk a city attorney to respond with a formal letter on the municipality's letterhead and she will likely back off.

His own account of it corroborates everything she said, with his only claim of innocence being that he said she wanted it while her filing a police report indicates that she certainly did not.\n\nThere is no reasonable doubt here. The agree on what occurred, and she says it was not consensual and filed a police report when it happened. The only reason not to believe her is because you don't care what women say about their own lived experience, and the only reason to leave this comment up is because you don't care about sexual assault.
