I have a nice set of ASOIAF books with very thin pages and unobtrusive covers, and no less than four separate times did a kindly old lady sit next to me on the bus and ask if I was reading the Bible. Every time I said I wasn't and showed them the cover, they spent the rest of the bus ride looking disappointed and uncomfortable, with the occasional awkward glance towards me. Different lady each time.",

I read the first two when I was probably about 9. I thought they were boring and stale. Caricatures of the myths that I was familiar with. But I didn't hate it, I just thought it was dull. \n\nBut then every time I would talk about my interest in mythology and history, someone would mention Percy Jackson. Every. Single. Time. How much I **must love** Percy Jackson. How I *have* to read Percy Jackson. How they loved Percy Jackson too! \n\nHaving Percy Jackson jammed in my face every time I talked about the thing I was most passionate about was taxing. It went from a series I thought was boring, to a book from hell that existed to mock me. It hasn't stopped either. It follows me around. Every new person I meet, they find out I like mythology and then ***boom*** Percy Jackson. It got bad again when the new show was released. \n\nPeople need new mythology material. Just *once* I want someone to bring up \"Iphigenia at Aulis\" instead. Or \"The Aeneid\", or even \"Mythos\" by Stephen Fry, please, anything but Percy Jackson, I'm begging you. \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9!",
