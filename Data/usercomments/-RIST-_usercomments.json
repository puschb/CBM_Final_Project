I often sat in my car parked on the parking lot to finish a chapter, before going in the office. Good ol times.\n\nHave more difficulty listening to audiobooks at home. Too distracted during the day and too sleepy while I'm in bed.\n\nHopefully the office will reopen for a few days a week at the end of this year, so I can pick up my audiobooks again.",

It's about a couple of defectors who look back on their life in and escape from North Korea. The book \"brings to life what it means to be living under the most repressive regime today\u2014an Orwellian world that is by choice not connected to the Internet, where displays of affection are punished, informants are rewarded, and an offhand remark can send a person to the gulag for life.\" I can really recommend it, I found it very intriguing.",
