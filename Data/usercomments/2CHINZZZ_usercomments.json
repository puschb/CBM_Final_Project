I really liked some of the musings on music/literature, the scenes at the cabin, and most of the Tanaka sections. On the other hand there were lots of cinfusing aspects and strange sex scenes. Guessing I would probably catch more on a reread.\n\nStarting **Pedro P\u00e1ramo, by Juan Rulfo**. Probably going to dive into some Hemingway short stories as well",

I'm glad that I read some background info on TSAR as I think I would have been somewhat confused otherwise. I particularly enjoyed the latter half during the festival. I also recently traveled to Spain, so it was cool to read about some of the locations that I had visited.\n\n Snow Crash was much better than Ready Player One which I read recently as well. The religious history/linguistics/virology stuff was interesting, but the exposition dumps did become a bit of a slog and I found some of the logic/premises to be tenuous.\n\nCurrently reading **Distant Star by Roberto Bola\u00f1o**. There are some great passages/scenes but I do feel like I'm missing out by not understanding all of the various poetry references.",
