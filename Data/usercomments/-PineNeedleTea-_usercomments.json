Professional voice actors *actually* act! They have a range and use it to fit the character design and the character. Celebrity voices are just themselves in every role....Chris Pratt as Garfield, Chris Pratt as Garfield, Chris Pratt as Emmett. Nowadays they just put actors in movies to advertise. I miss the days when the focus was on the actual story and characters instead of whatever celebrity of the week is trending.",

Thought the cover looked pretty and was looking forward to reading a vampire story....and I just couldn't get past the first few chapters. It was just so bland and poorly written and genuinely gave me a headache trying to power through it. Gave up on it. Years later 50 Shades was this next big thing and it sounded awful. Found it funny that it had started as Twilight fan fiction, lol.",
