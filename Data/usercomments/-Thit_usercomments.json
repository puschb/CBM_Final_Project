I could be wrong. \n\nWhat they were saying, If memory serves, was that seeing a trigger warning for the trauma they had experienced, put them back into that place of the trauma. So sometimes it would trigger an event - sometimes only after multiple exposures online. From the words themselves not the material. So they requested that the word be changed to a code word or abbreviated so they wouldn\u2019t have to see the words describing their traumas. But if that was the case that code word would have to be changed periodically which isn\u2019t applicable for printed materials.\n\nLike I said, I have nothing against trigger warnings. I question their usefulness and how they affect people, but given that I\u2019m not an expert I choose a fairly neutral position. If a compromise can be met where the people who want them can get them and benefit and the ones who don\u2019t want them don\u2019t have to see them, that\u2019s a win/win in my book.\n\nI think a 3rd party option would be optimal because then people could outright exclude certain terms and never have to engage with them. But I also understand the argument of having to seek something like that out.",

Not who it affects or how it manifests. But now I know that it\u2019s going to happen and it\u2019s subconsciously in the back of my mind the entire time I\u2019m reading and not in a way where it makes me excited to read further.\n\nLike when is it going to happen? Who is it happening to? How will it be handled? I don\u2019t want these questions. They\u2019re genuinely distracting. \n\nAlso, I read The Road by Cormac McCarthy last year. The scenes that made that book have impact and made me sit up and consider what had just happened - basically what made it land - was effective because I didn\u2019t know it was going to happen and it would have 100% been a trigger warning. That trigger warning would have softened the blow so much that it wouldn\u2019t have had any impact at all.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say that people shouldn\u2019t be able to access trigger warnings for books if they want them. That\u2019s fine. I understand why some feel they need them (although I do believe there\u2019s an argument to be made that trigger warnings become triggering. It was discussed that it was happening on twitter some years ago where they had to change the words for the trigger warnings because the warning became triggering as well. So I take the whole thing with a grain of salt. I accept it as a courtesy toward others who could be in vulnerable situations, rather than a scientifically proven effective tool). \n\nJust make it something a reader has to opt in to. Don\u2019t expose me to it if I don\u2019t want to see it. Because that can\u2019t be undone.",
