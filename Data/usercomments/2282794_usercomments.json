Anyway, a famous pianist was nearby and I opened my bag to grab a sharpie for him for an autograph. He curled his lip and mockingly asked \u201cwhy are you reading THAT?!\u201d  I felt ashamed even thought I was thoroughly enjoying the book. I was in my 20s then. Today I think he was just being a smug asshole.",

One version became very popular, so popular that Cervantes used it in his own continuation of the story which became part 2 of the novel. It\u2019s absolutely hilarious. Cervantes made damn sure Don Quixote was very dead at the end. The whole book is laugh out loud funny and I hope this post will get some of you to read it. Just read the opening chapter and you\u2019ll see.",
