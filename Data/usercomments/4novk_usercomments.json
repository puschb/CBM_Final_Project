I do buy my absolute favorites and the ones that I'm certain to read again and again! :) I've had a lot of books in the past, but I really prefer it like this. It also makes me remember that I read because I enjoy it so much, not because I have a certain amount of books I dictate myself to read like it's a chore or a checklist (also why I stopped setting reading goals on Goodreads).",
