I loved the narrator\u2019s voice and the mispronunciations were the one thing that pulled me out of the story.",

I wouldn\u2019t call anything about her books low stakes (quite the opposite) which seems to go against how some people are defining cozy, but I think her books feel like a big warm hug nonetheless.",

For authors like Grisham, we literally buy dozens (maybe around 60) copies of his new releases. For sci-fi, we often only get 3 copies of a new title, or 6 if it\u2019s hotly anticipated. If the last of a sci-fi title is withdrawn, we won\u2019t usually replace it due to lack of demand. Sci-fi is my personal favorite and I often find myself doing an inter library loan just to get a title I want because they\u2019re not popular enough for us to keep on our shelves.",
