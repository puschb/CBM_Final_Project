Last summer I met up with an old travel buddy who I hadn\u2019t seen in 10+ years, and she had a list of books she\u2019s read that she thought I\u2019d like.  I felt embarrassed to say I basically haven\u2019t read since we had travelled together, so I made a vow to myself to read more.  It\u2019s nice bonding time with my daughter to just sit under a blanket together and read, even when it\u2019s our own separate books.\n\nTry to be a good model for your daughter in the sense that she will see you reading for personal enjoyment instead of just reading to her.  It may entice her to pick up a book more!",

I actually have to take books away at the table while she\u2019s eating or else she\u2019ll forget to eat.   Even though she reads herself, we still have a big chapter book that I read to her most nights after she has some personal reading time before bed.  \n\nAs a teacher, parents tell me that they don\u2019t have time to read to their kids at night, but I talk to my students and they tell me their parents are watching tv or on their phone.",
