And certainly there are many horrific images and scenes in the show. However, as one other commenter here notes, there are scenes depicted in the books that are worse than anything that was seen on screen in the series. While looked away during certain moments in the television series, there were also paragraphs that I skimmed because I was finding them so disturbing I could not read them.\n\nI note that I have a very strong imagination, so the images that I can imagine as described in the book can be much more awful and disturbing than anything that was depicted in the TV series.",
