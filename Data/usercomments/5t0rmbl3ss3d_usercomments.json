Maybe I just read it too late, but I felt that the myth was already deconstructed by virtue of itself, this book could do nothing to convince me that I wasn't already aware of the rape and violence committed unto Native Americans. \nIdk, it's something I wish to reread in future years, but the first read was honestly a slog.",
