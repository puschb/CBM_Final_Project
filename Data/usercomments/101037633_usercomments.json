And, as an adult, I should be leading by example. There were kids listening to music too. \n\nI told her I don\u2019t like many people, and especially dislike nosy ones. Then I said something about a book and headphones are my (polite?) way of keeping to myself and not bothering complete strangers. This all started with her tapping me on the shoulder.\n\nI was called rude. I shrugged and went back to my music and books. \n\nI still don\u2019t understand why this happened.",

        "body": "I was nine (Grade 3) when I got my hands on Jurassic Park. \n\nI took a long time to learn to read. In grade 3 I went from Mr. Muggs (picture books), to Jurassic Park, The Hobbit, The Belgariad, etc. My mom didn\u2019t care what I read, so long as I was reading. My mom took reading very seriously, and was very happy to spend hours in the library with my brother and I. We went to the public library weekly, at times.\n\nI basically skipped an entire genre of books for intermediate ages, going from young kids books to adult.\n\nMy teacher thought it was her right to monitor what we were reading. She would walk us weekly to the public library, and then try to corral us into the kids area. I would always sneak off to the adult section, when her back was turned. \n\nEvery time my class went to the library, my mom was either taking us or we had already gone. So, I never took out books. This lead the teacher into trying to demand that she keep my library card. My mom gave her a firm no, and assured her that she was fully capable of keeping track of our reading and she was fully aware of what I was reading and my comprehension on it.\n\nBack to Jurassic Park. My teacher took it away from me, saying it was too scary and too advanced. I went crying to my mom to get the book back. My mom happily complied and told this teacher to never take anything away from me again, especially a book. \n\nMy mom hated this teacher. There were battles over me almost weekly. The teacher thought I should be special ed. My mom knew I was delayed, but very capable of catching up. I proved this is grades 4 onwards, when my grades went from D\u2019s and C\u2019s and into high B\u2019s to A\u2019s. Some kids just take longer. I, in the end, mostly taught myself. Once I learned how to read (also, mostly self taught), I was fine on my own.",

I give it a grace period, of 50-70 pages. If it hasn\u2019t caught my attention at this point, then it\u2019s on to the next TBR book.
