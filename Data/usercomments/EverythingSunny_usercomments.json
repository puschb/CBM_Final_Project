It takes very little effort to do them or read them, and it's weird that they got dragged into culture war nonsense. That being said, my understanding was they don't appear to actually work? Like there isn't any evidence that being warned ahead of time reduce people's anxiety when the event actually occurs, and people don't usually avoid a thing because of the trigger warning either. It's more a thing neurotypical people *think* would help neurodivergant people than anything. If there is research to the contrary, I would be happy to take a look though.",

Only kids in the normal English classes were having to read books cover to cover. This is all a natural consequence of teachers having to prep their students for standardized tests. That being said, at 18, I was a big dumb fucking idiot and could only engage with books on the surface level of the plot. There wasn't much value in forcing me to read a school book cover to cover, I wasn't going to get much out of it to begin with. And I was one of the kids who was constantly reading.",

        "body": "Because publishers only pushed/marketed shitty LOTR fanfiction for a really long time. Also, fantasy was treated like romance: pure escapism. Good stuff was still coming out, but I have no earthly idea how you would find out about it. It feels like there was a conscious effort by publishers to recategotize fantasy books into different genres. This series isn't fantasy. It's paranormal romance. This short story isn't fantasy. It's magical realism. The goddamn Dark Tower books were in the horror section. Harry Potter wasn't in fantasy. It was in young adult. Dune isn't fantasy. It's Science Fiction or Sci Fantasy. Star Wars, too. Anything that wasn't alternative reality set in a facsimile of medieval Europe was something else. \n\nRecently, the genre has been getting taken more seriously. I think the popularity of GoT had a lot to do with that, as it was much less silly and fantastical than previously popular fantasy media. We are also seeing an explosion of different settings and time period analogs. Publishers are finally marketing more ambitious books from different kinds of voices than we've been used to seeing in the past. We are seeing authors explore Big Ideas in fantasy too, or at least those author's work is finally starting to get noticed. I would bet there are tons of gems sitting gathering dust on used bookstore shelves, never to see the light of day because we don't know they exist.",
