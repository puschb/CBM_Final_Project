Personally its not my cup of tea as I am more of a historical romance reader but this is why I don't pick up books that are labeled as dark romance or has a long list of content warnings because guaranteed it will definitely have lots of taboo things because thats the whole point. Its just weird when people pick up a dark romance and then are upset when it does exactly what dark romances are known to do. Also, its good practice to dig deeper into understanding why people are hyping things up rather than just reading something due to hype. It will save you a lot of frustration.",

In fact Kindle would be the cheapest option as ebooks go on sale all the time. I usually add a bunch of ebooks to my Amazon wishlist and check it daily to see if any of it went on sale. Easy way to get a book for $2 or $4.\n\nI haven't seen much in the way of major book sales even during the holidays though on occasion Amazon may have a buy 2 get 1 free. Barnes and Noble also does stuff with their points system if you are a member (they have a free version and a premium version where you get discounts).

Of course some stuff can change genres simply by changing one element. Think time travel for instance.

Also the people that are translating it into English aren't necessarily writers themselves to polish things up a bit. Its definitely not a genre to go into expecting high quality.
