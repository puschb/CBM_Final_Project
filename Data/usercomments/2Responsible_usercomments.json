On one hand, there is English language literary fiction that is totally accessible with plain language (still, past basic conversational) that I would guess you could handle easily. Hemingway is probably a great start for native speaking English literature. Another easy way might be to read a modern english translation of a work originally in another language. Modern translations tend to render things in more plain english in my experience. Like the Christine Donaugher translation of Les Miserables (The Wretched), or a modern translation of Dostoevsky.\n\nOn the other hand, there are authors who you have to look up constantly and that will probably never change. I'm a native english speaker who has read all my life and Nabakov and Joyce will always kick my ass. Pale Fire had me looking up words multiple times a page. Joyce's Ulysses famously has something like 20,000 unique words in it. I haven't read it in years but I'm sure it would still be as much of a study session as a reading session for me.\n\nGood luck and have fun!",
