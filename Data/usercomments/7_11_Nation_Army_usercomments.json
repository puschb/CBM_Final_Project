I am currently reading it and the concept is so thrilling to me \u2013 a history of a nation through para-personal experiences, but it would do nothing if the writing were not so brilliant.\n\nI have an idea why it felt weird to you, though. From the rest of your post it seems that you are a fast reader, while \"The Years\" felt more like a poetry book to me, and I decided to only read a few pages per day. That feels like the right pace to be able to appreciate it.\n\nI came upon this post because I was looking for recommendations about similar books about other nations, because I would be really interested to read some of those after I am done with this book.\n\nDid it grow on you after writing the post? Did you finish it?",
