Story was good, ended on a cliff hanger, sucks. Time to find a new story and i would forget about the unfinished ones. Lots of fantasy books set up for trilogies and sequels that never got published in the 90s and early 2010s and there was no amazon to self publish to get it to your audience. \n\nPeople seem way to obsessed with \"gotta catch em all\" with books/series. Patrick Rothfuss's books are so well written that i red books 1 & 2 in like 7 days no book 3... well that sucks, what else is there.... and thats how i found the malazan book of the fallen \"series\". The only continuous story are the first 3 but each novel ends and is stand alone. Ive found lots of books with the best and most \"complete\" series do that. \n\nThe split with \"feast for crows\" and \"dance with dragons\" was so annoying and THAT cliff hanger sucked. I threw \"feat for crows across the room\".\n\nBut oh well, time to find something new. \n\nThere is only 1 book series that ive wanted the next book. It was gonna be a trilogy, read it in like 2001, set in an arctic area and got 2 books in. Even looked on the internet for it, nothing and now ive forgotten the author and any of the titles. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.",
