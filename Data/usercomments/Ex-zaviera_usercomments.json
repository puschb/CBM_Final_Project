So bikeshare companies have a job called \"rebalancer\"- this is a person who moves bikes to where they are needed.\n\nBunnylover, I propose that you become a rebalancer of books in LFLs. If a LFL in a rich area is teeming, grab some books and redistribute them to a LFL that is a little bare. I do this in my city.\n\nGood luck!",
