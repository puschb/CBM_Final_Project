I feel like this makes me calmer and more in the moment, which is beneficial for my mental health. It was stressful and weird at first but I got used to it. HOWEVER - one book I always have to change the speed is the first HP book with Stephen Fry, it is being read at such a ridiculous speed?! I tune it down to 0,8 or I can\u2019t use it to fall asleep to (which is how I use the HP-books haha)",
