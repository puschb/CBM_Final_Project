It feels like someone just telling you a story, no frills. When the prose is that damn good, you can whatever the hell you want.",

Your mile may vary with the rest of the series since he does follow the traditional POV change chapters-to-chapter. I personally love his POV chapters since each character is distinct from each other. The prose changes to match the character\u2019s mindset and he\u2019s great at characterization.",

There\u2019s a chapter called casualties in which we follow a soldier in a massive battle that is then killed and then we follow their killer\u2019s POV. He repeats that method a few times in that single chapter and it brilliantly captures the dizzying nature of being in a battle.",

I Love his work tho.\n\nI didn\u2019t mind the absence of quotations marks at all. I get used to it after a while. Thought it was a solid book with a fantastic TV adaptation. Paul Mescal and Daisy-Edgar Jones are incredible in that show.\n\nI would power through if you are enjoying it. I especially loved the portrayal of loneliness and being unsure of yourself in high school & college and how both characters gravitates towards each other due to those circumstances.",
