Not to say that they all align with each other, but just that they all take a similar stance towards politics (usually geopolitics) that frames actions in terms of competition between self-interested agents in an anarchist system.",

It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s a mathematician, or a fabulist whose only interest is creating aesthetically pleasing worlds without any relation to ours. It\u2019s my theory at least for why he wrote Lolita from such a warped perspective as the narrator\u2019s, to distance the audience from accepting any point made by the narrator as true. Not that literature could ever be totally insular, since it\u2019s always communicating something, but Nabokov seemed to warp that communication as much as possible, without adopting any of the conspicuous tactics of his postmodernist peers. I\u2019m willing to read more books by him as well as secondary literature and see how this theory holds, but if it or something more refined than it bears out, I\u2019ll feel my aloofness towards him is justified",

In fact, noticing how each chapter parallels the Odyssey is probably the easiest part in reading any chapter. What\u2019s difficult about the book is how Joyce is referencing about 30 different things in any line, from the Bible to old Irish myths, political episodes in 19th century Ireland, eastern philosophy, medical knowledge, etc.; how he stylizes his prose after whatever major theme he\u2019s tackling (for example, there\u2019s one chapter where he reconstructs the history of the English language through his prose, as in the chapter starts out in a gibberish style emulating Latin grammar, then to an old English style, then to a Middle English style, and so on); how he abruptly switches POVs; how much of the book is written in a stream of consciousness style, which is pretty difficult to understand; and how you have to keep track of hundreds of characters and events which get brought up sometimes quite obscurely, and sometimes before you\u2019ve even first been introduced to them. The Scylla and Charybdis chapter, for example, is centered around the notion of duality, and is also a heady intellectual debate about Hamlet. Pretty much every line is a reference to a Shakespeare play, as the main character builds up the argument that \u201cHamlet\u2019s grandson is his own father,\u201d and is chock full of obscure references to schisms between Christian mysticism and modern science, Plato and Aristotle, William Blake and less emotive poets, etc. The whole point of the chapter (though like any chapter in the book, this is just the main point I found, even though there are plenty more) is about Stephen, the main character, struggling to find a middle path between a description of the world \u2014 as dictated by science and reason \u2014 as a cold, dead, determined place, and another \u2014 as pronounced by religion and unreason \u2014 where it is wondrous, sublime, and holy. The former is difficult emotionally and spiritually for Stephen, yet the latter does harm to his credulousness. Anyway, this was all just to demonstrate how very very dense the book is, and how that density disrupts the surface text so as to make it completely obscure at multiple points without secondary guides",
