If you meet someone like me, I would definitely chat with you a lot and consider it a pleasant experience that brightens up my day. There was one time when I chatted with a taxi driver throughout the entire ride. \n\nIf others seem to feel disturbed, it's best to stop your actions. Some people simply don't enjoy conversations with strangers, as there are instances when someone who suddenly starts talking might have other intentions.",
