Added to that, the dialect, Hiberno-English, retains a lot of the grammar of Irish, different sentence structures, things like that, as well as the extra tense I mentioned.\n\nThere is a bit of indirect dialogue, but it can flow between direct and indirect, without necessarily signposting that it's doing so.\n\nThere's also just a tendency to play with language a bit more than is usual, I think.",

But his narration has a voice that's distinct from the characters' voices. \n\nIt's much more like speech, if someone's telling you a story, you wouldn't stop stop them and ask for speech tags, and if the storyteller is good enough you get into the flow of it.\n\nIf I'm reading Stephen King the narrator sort of isn't there, I'm observing the things he's talking about, but when I read Macken it's always Macken himself telling a story.",

Stephen Erikson lists it as a major inspiration, and Malazan's themes are concerned with the same things, while certain plotlines and characters seem like they just wouldn't exist without Covenant's influence.\n\nWhenever this series comes up a ton of comments will say that Covenant himself is too disgusting to read it, but imo this is like saying Crime and Punishment shouldn't be read because Raskolnikov is a murderer.\n\nThis is often accompanied by the claim that the leads have no redeeming qualities, which is a mind-blowing statement to me, since the leads spend the entire series trying to make up for their shortcomings.\n\nIt's still a difficult, and often unpleasant, piece, so I wouldn't fault people for not getting through it, but refusing to read it because the main characters do bad things is very shot sighted to me.\n\nUltimately, I think it's worth the effort of reading it, and it deserves to be recognised as the landmark it is, and after Tolkien I'd say it's the book that did the most to define where fantasy writing is now.",
