That's because the way human brains work, we have emotions first and then we attempt to rationalise those emotions, and that rationalisation we call our opinion, but it's not always an accurate description of what we actually feel. \n\nYou dislike AI because it is not human, possibly also because you perceive it or it's weird fans as threatening to creative fields you value, and \"anything it makes will always be bad because it lacks intention\" is just the explanation your brain has come up with for why AI not being human causes you to feel negative emotions about it. If that was not the case, you'd still dislike AI, but you'd come up with a better explanation for why that was after realising that lack of intention wasn't the reason. That's basically how introspection works, it's progressively refining our understanding of our emotions. \n\nIt's for this reason that I can also predict that you have an objection to this comment which goes something along the lines of \"but AI could never have intention so that's a moot point\". \n\nMy point is that humans as a whole have a greater lack of interest in AI-generated content than any specific criticism of it, that will always result in most people completely ignoring AI works regardless of quality.",

It's the only romance story that makes me feel like the characters genuinely belong together, as opposed to just happening to be together, with enough introspection on both characters' parts to explain why what they get out of that specific relationship couldn't come from anywhere or anyone else.\n\nIt's also undramatic.

Brave New World feels much closer to the kind of future humans could one day find themselves in, because it gives its characters the ability to make decisions besides compliance or revolution and explores what kinds of decisions people might make in that sort of world. \n\nTo put it another way, 1984 only has room for two characters.",

She's also improbably talented at the story's main plot resolution mechanic (probably combat), which proves useful when she finds herself roped into a deadly contest at the whim of the ruler of the oppressive regime. Throughout the contest, she finds herself developing a romance with a similarly aged male described as attractive, while also learning about the dark secrets behind the regime. She is then tasked with more killings, but this time refuses to do so, which results in her aligning with a rebel faction. In the meantime, she must struggle with her lover being in the grip of the evil power, tricked by some dark magic into being an enemy, while at the same time considering the other option of a lover candidate who is already an ally, and whom fans seem to have divided into teams on. Complicating matters further, she has been granted a very significant role within the rebellion.\n\nThat's the Hunger Games, which concluded the same year Maas's extremely similar story began.

Absolute worst case scenario when they do that is that they're annoying you because in your mind the title \"driver\" is reserved for people who apply some arbitrary minimum level of skill, a problem you can solve by simply not talking to them.\n\nThe second problem I have with your position here is that it's absurdly absolute. Why are the two options you're operating on here \"blind people don't drive\" and \"blind people sit in self-driving cars\"? What if the technology allowing a blind person to operate a truck was a camera that fed visual information straight to their brain, bypassing broken optic nerves, would they get to be called a driver then? \n\nApplying this analogy to creative disciplines makes absolute binaries like this even less relevant, because all creative disciplines combine many different tasks, and most of the people who are interested in using tools - AI or otherwise - to assist in their creativity are not those blind drivers letting the cars drive themselves. Yes, you can tell an LLM \"Give me a 50,000 word novel about a haddock\", but no one's really doing that except to troll. What people are actually doing with these tools is using them to optimise their creative time and energy, making it easier to get done the bits that don't interest them so that they can put more of their effort into the bits that do interest them. Previously, these are people who would have just winged those bits, or even be put off from doing anything creative at all by the gate that says if you can't do everything well there's no point doing anything. \n\nAnd we've all seen those sorts of writers before, right? The sci-fi writer whose dialogue feels as if they've never had a conversation with a human, the romance writer who couldn't tell you what \"worldbuilding\" meant if it bit them on the uvula. Lacking the tools doesn't make these people become more skilled, it just makes them say \"I don't really care about this bit so I'll do the bare minimum\" - and the sci-fi writer still gets to be perceived as good enough because sci-fi is about concept not dialogue, and the romance writer still gets to be perceived as good enough because romance is about drama not world. Those are the people who are still going to be using AI once the fad wears off (which it really already has), and I guarantee it will not result in any reduction in quality whatsoever, so suddenly withholding the term \"writer\" from them makes no sense.",

        "body": "Right, and just like what we saw in gaming... it's actually fine. The gaming industry never collapsed, it's doing better than ever from a profit angle. That's because piracy is a matter of convenience, not price, and for a good while now Steam has acted as the ultimate convenience. People mostly preferred to just buy the game themselves, rather than going through the hassle of getting a friend to give you a copy or finding a safe and well-seeded torrent. And it happened with Netflix too. Piracy of movies and TV shows dropped quite a bit thanks to Netflix, because Netflix's content delivery mechanisms and library were fantastic, and then began crawling back up again as Netflix got worse. \n\nBooks do fall closer to the music end of the media spectrum than the gaming end, being much easier to download than games, but that's still fine - music piracy is at the lowest point in over a decade now thanks to spotify and youtube music being more convenient for most users. Plus, as media types go, books probably have the audience most willing to pay for content even if they don't strictly have to. So book sales will be fine, as long as book distribution platforms focus on offering greater convenience than piracy options, which for books is pretty easy to do.",
