Then read the Bear town series, again was okay but nothing spectacular.\nI actually quite enjoyed Britt-Marie was here and am currently about halfway through My Grandmother Sends her Regards and Apologies and I am really struggling to get through it as I really don't like it.\n\nI think Anxious People is his best book and sets the bar pretty high, so if you read it first you are bound to be a bit disappointed with Backman's other books.",
