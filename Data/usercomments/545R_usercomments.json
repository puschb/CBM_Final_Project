It\u2019s only deplorable by an arbitrary law that sets legal adulthood at 18, and only then for the things that benefit the government, like voting, taxes, and military service, but not for drinking alcohol, consuming tobacco or marijuana, or driving a car.\n\nMany local governments will have exceptions to the concept of statutory rape when the ages are close together or it was considered consensual by both parties (so long as the government hasn\u2019t banned your ability to consent based on your legal adulthood status).\n\nMy heart goes out to you, since this is obviously an issue close to you emotionally, but it just doesn\u2019t seem right to just the quality if character in a relationship solely due to  an age range. Healthy doesn\u2019t keep a calendar of such things.\n\nI think most people agreed with you that it was a cute and sweet dynamic, and chose to ignore the legalism needed to ruin the characters.",
