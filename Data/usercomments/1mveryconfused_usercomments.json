The combination of the vaguely incestuous storyline coupled with puberty made for a super uncomfortable read. The cover art was pretty though.",

I didn't know the narrator was allowed to lie or cheat or mislead- until then I had only been acquainted with \"faithful\" narrators. I definitely thought about it for a long time, partly because before the twist I had become almost fond of the narrator and was cheering him on on his quest to uncover his friend's murder :/",

She's a child who had a future ahead of her, but because of the abuse she faced at Humbert's hands she ended up pregnant at 16, and later dies in childbirth. Her mother dies while she's away from home, and the man who has been posing as her \"guardian\" takes that opportunity to rape her repeatedly, while on the road with no stable safe space for her to go back. Just because Humbert feels like she's A-okay doesn't make it so, because he's an unreliable narrator who set out to justify his pedophilia and rape throughout the book. Of course he ruined her life, he just wouldn't accept it.",
