The solution is for these device makers and sites to give parents easy ways to limit the bad stuff. \n\n>Screen use is absolutely ubiquitous so urging caution as if we could be going too hard against it is absurd.\n\nMy annecdata is that I personally know several parents who constantly rail on their kids that \"screens\" are BAD without any sense of nuance whatsoever because it is easy to use shorthand. \"Screens\" includes so many things that are as positive or even more positive than reading many books. And as already mentioned, many people actually read books on screens. I cannot read dead trees anymore because reading on a ereader is such a superior experience.",
