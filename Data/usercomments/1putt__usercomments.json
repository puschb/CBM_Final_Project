But due to its predictable plot and boring subplots it left me feeling pretty meh about the whole novel. \n\nStarted: \n\n**Salems Lot, by Stephen King**  \nAt this point I am currently half through the book, and I am enjoying it immensely. The setup of the characters, setting and antagonist so far has been expertly done. Only gripe I have so far is some chapters are just taken over by Stephen King prose and they get so overbearing. But besides that its going really well and I'm just loving the pace of it.",

Overall, I really loved the characters and the whole premise of the three-body theory game. However, I was left quite disappointed at the end, but that hasn\u2019t turned me off from reading the next entry.\n\nI also finished **Dawnshard**, which is the prelude novella for Rhythm of War. It\u2019s a much better novella in comparison to Edgedancer, with a lot more going on and more interesting ideas. However, like Edgedancer, it is fairly weak in the plot department. That said, the character development is really good here.\n\nStarted:\n\nRight after I finished Dawnshard, I jumped straight into **Rhythm of War**. I\u2019m currently only a quarter of the way through, but I will say I am enjoying it a lot more than I did Oathbringer, which I found pretty dry for the majority of the book.\n\nThe last book I started reading was **Bookshops and Bonedust**. I picked this up because I\u2019m part of a buddy read with someone else, and I had kept putting it off due to life getting in the way. I started it a few nights ago, and it has really taken me away. It\u2019s such a cozy read, and the characters are really lovely. I can\u2019t wait to dig into it after work and finish it.",
