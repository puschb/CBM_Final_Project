Sometimes people grow out of interests, sometimes not.\n\nBut I'm sure a lot of it is due to the issues gaming faces nowadays that books just... don't have. A game costs as much as, like, 6 or 7 softbacks nowadays, so it's a much higher risk of disappointment because of the financial inestment vs a \u00a37\u201310 on a novel. Also, publishers can't shoehorn microtransactions into books, and they don't cut parts out of manuscripts to sell as overpriced DLC either lol. Same with movies and TV \u2014 again, cinemas and streaming subs are extortionate compared to a book.\n\nAlso, I think it's the sheer limitlessness of fiction books that keeps things exciting. You really just never know what you could discover in a book. Not to say that games/movies/TV can't surprise us anymore, but you'll never find the truly out-there stuff you can come across in literature.",
