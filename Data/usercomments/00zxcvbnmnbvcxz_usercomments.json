So the bone clocks did not distract from the experience for me. Utopia Avenue, however, suffers terribly by him trying to shoehorn in the magic of the other books. It just feels so awkward and out of place, and really distracting. I would never recommend that book to anyone, even though I enjoyed it, as the hard left turn into magic just doesn\u2019t work at all.",
