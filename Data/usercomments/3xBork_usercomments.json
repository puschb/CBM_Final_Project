Let characters make better decisions or let them feel the consequences of their actions.\n\n\nBit of a sidetrack but this is a big issue in TV writing these last couple of years. Everyone wants to do the Game of Thrones schtick where they make the audience hate the bad guy, but without the writing chops to make it all work.\u00a0\n\n\nYou get a universe where all the good/neutral characters get mercilessly punished for the slightest of character flaws or mistakes, while the baddies do braindead stupid stuff and somehow get away with it. Everyone suddenly grows compassion and forgiveness for fantasy Hitler, forgets it's been their life's mission to defeat him or just plain stands by and watches when their one-in-a-million opportunity presents itself.\u00a0\n\n\nIf blue-balling your audience for the slightest bit of karma to come to the antagonists is your main way of building up a villain, I'm putting your book down and never picking it up again.",
