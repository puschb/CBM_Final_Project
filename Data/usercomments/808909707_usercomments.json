I also supplement my list by adding re-read of something I read a long time ago. \n\nI generally don\u2019t remember anything about the book after a few years, but I will remember if I liked it or not. So on the 2nd pass it feels fresh again. Works even better with non fiction because often I will now have a rudimentary understanding due to the first read and can get a lot more out of the book on the 2nd read. \n\n\nSlightly off topic, but for Non fiction I have now adopted the strategy of listening to the audio book first ( if available) to get a basic grasp, and then going back to the print or ebook if the concepts merit further investigation or study.",
