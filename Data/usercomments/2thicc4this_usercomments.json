Is it a great book? Not really but I found it pleasant to puzzle over and satisfying to read the reveal.",

I think that you\u2019re brain and your days are too overwhelmed by all of the new information you are exposed to and trying to process. Like the last thing I felt I wanted to do was pick up a book. I played lots of video games. You\u2019re already asking a lot of your brain, it\u2019s like asking a professional football player why they don\u2019t feel like tossing a ball around on their days off. Just be patient and when life calms down a bit, I promise you will be picking books up again.",

It\u2019s not hard to understand why we don\u2019t want to be immediately asked to sympathize with a child rapist war criminal. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to put the book down, or criticize it for this. I don\u2019t think that makes us rabid moral absolutists who can\u2019t handle books that deal with nuanced people. It\u2019s a book about healing trauma that has portions that trigger a lot of peoples traumas. I think it\u2019s actually a valid criticism of the book.",
