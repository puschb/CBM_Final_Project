They didn\u2019t know how to look up words they didn\u2019t know without googling it (which is a different but still useful skill). I asked them do you ask your parents if you don\u2019t know a certain word? Most said their parents didn\u2019t know either so they gave up. They were referring to words like affectionate, kindling, aerospace. But most kids just gave up and never tried to even use context clues to figure out what the words meant.",
