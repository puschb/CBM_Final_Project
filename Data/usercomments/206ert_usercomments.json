Don\u2019t want people sweating over paying a few dollars in fines (which are almost always forgiven if there is a hardship) but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re good for the $20-$30 replacement charge. Assuming they\u2019re even on the hook for that. \n\nNot buying that things improve after removing fines. My library removed fines during covid and the waitlist for items doesn\u2019t budge. Im using the library exclusively now for digital ebooks or online audiobooks.",
