I gift them all sorts of books and I always tell them it\u2019s okay if they don\u2019t like them but if they do happen to like any books I have gotten them I frequently tell them I will buy more if they tell me which ones they like. \n\nI usually get them the first book to different series so they can have variety and maybe find a series they really love. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever finished a single book I\u2019ve ever given them or even opened them at all. I hide money in the pages of the books I give them and whenever I go visit I check their bookshelf and I open books I\u2019ve given them only to find all the money still right where I left it every time. \n\nI always check to make sure the books are age appropriate before I buy them and I always encourage them to at least try them. They never do and recently they told me reading sucks and reading was boring or stupid but when I asked why they thought that they didn\u2019t have an answer for me it\u2019s like they were repeating something they had heard from someone else or maybe YouTube.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten them; Ralph S Mouse, Magic Treehouse regular and graphic novels, Redwall, Guardians of Gahoole, Warrior cats regular and the graphic novel, dogman, dairy of a wimpy kid, wings of fire regular and the graphic novel, Fablehaven, Tunnels, The Buccaneers, Artemis fowl regular and graphic novel, percy Jackson regular and graphic novel, the Indian and the cupboard, various kids science and history books, Wolves of the beyond, Gregor the overlander, Narnia box set, and more. All of them sit gathering dust on a shelf in the corner of their room.\n\nThey would rather play on their iPads and watch YouTube shorts. I cannot even get them to watch a full length movie because they don\u2019t have the attention span to watch more than a few minutes of it without asking me when it\u2019s going to end and they can have their iPads back. They get bored of listening to audiobooks on car rides and they want their iPads instead. They have a Nintendo switch and they don\u2019t use it because \u201cit gets boring too fast.\u201d \n\nI will no longer be buying them any books because I know they won\u2019t read them. I even saw the wild robot book set and I nearly got it for them but I remembered they haven\u2019t touched a single book I\u2019ve ever given them and it would be a waste of my money buying them books. And I keep asking what they want for Christmas and they don\u2019t know so if they don\u2019t figure something out soon they\u2019ll just be a single rc car each and clothes.",
