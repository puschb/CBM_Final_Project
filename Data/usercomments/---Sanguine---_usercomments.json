This web series called Ar\u2019Kendrithyst has a part where there is a group of monsters hunting the protagonist, and every time you see them you forget they exist for a second. Was absolutely horrifying because the protagonist kept getting injured and then stopped to try and figure out what was going on. Eventually just escaped and someone else filled her in on it. So well written and honestly just terrifying.",
