I read the book when I was about 11-13 and remember being disappointed even back then... The fact that people are often referencing it next to 1984 is criminal! \nMaybe it's because I myself am from a post (now borderline) authoritarian state, but that story almost felt like an insult. And the unnecessary romance that did nothing good for the pilot (yes i know that the author didn't originally plan on that) definitely did not help. Neither did the fact that the MC wasn't really likeable, not because she was moody and almost estranged but because she felt quite shallow... Katnees is the type of character me and my friends would come up whime playing pretend))))))",
