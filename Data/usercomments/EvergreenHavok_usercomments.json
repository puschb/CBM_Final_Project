I stopped reading for a long time bc of the sheer amount of stuff I need to read for work and then just decided I wanted to read something about dragons bc that used to make me happy and suddenly I was crushing novels again.\n\nYou could try:\n\n* **Change the topic/style** - read distinctly different pieces from what you are reading in class. Could be non fiction, genre, movie adaptations, folklore, poetry.\n\n* **Change the format** - listen to audiobooks (that's what got me back to reading for fun- downloaded Libby and went buckwild), try comics, get really into fanfic, lurk in scriptwriting/trading spaces, etc.\n\n* **Be joyfully fickle** - I'd just chase something dumb that makes you happy. Give yourself a low barrier to entry and a lot of leniency in case you hate it or 'meh' it. Just throw around permission to abandon anything that isn't fun, calming, or satisfying.",

( r/badwomensanatomy has a lot of this)\n\n(2) How sexism works and feels - systemic oppression disappears for a lot of women in books written by men- often the women are even bestowed benefits for being women. And instead of exhaustion, annoyance, or low grade ever present disappointment that can reach rage or needing space from people who don't have to deal with it, we get pouters.\n\n(3) Bullshit stereotypes - all the women-be's - \"over emotional,\" \"natural caretakers,\" \"wanting nothing but to land a man,\" \"baby crazy\" - if the only reason a character wants those things is her gender identity so you don't/won't explain it, that's weird.
