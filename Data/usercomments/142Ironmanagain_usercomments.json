Usually involves big, generational family history (complete with family trees!) during a specific place , from its beginning to the present. History lessons of a place through the people who went through it. Became famous for writing Tales of the South Pacific, which was turned into a famous musical & movie back in the 40s. He wrote over 40 books, mostly fiction but some non-fiction too. I\u2019ve read a lot by him: my favorites are: Hawaii (my first and many claim as his best), Texas, Chesapeake, Caribbean and Poland. The Novel was interesting because it took you into the book publishing world circa 1991.\nI still have Centennial in my to-read pile.\nEdward Rutherfurd, James Clavell, Herman Wouk, Leon Uris & Ken Follett are writers similar to his writing style as well.",

Not only great characters but a history lesson at the same time. It was my first Michener, and still might be my favorite.

There are plenty of tools available to help unlock him, if you\u2019re into that: Pynchon wiki site which covers every novel, Pynchon in public podcast, which are very long and interesting and cover most of his stuff, as well as readers guides/companions to 4 out of 8 of his books.
