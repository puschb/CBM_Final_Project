I would create a reward chart with him so that if he reads, let\u2019s say five really short books by the end of the week, he gets a reward (reward will depend on what you have the ability to provide/what he likes). \nAs he improves, I would make the books longer. Once the books are longer, he doesn\u2019t have to finish them in one day but maybe read a page or two a day. \n\nGreat skills to work on are segmenting words, blending words and working on recognizing sight words without having to segment and then blend them (lots of videos on YouTube you can check out for each skill and how to prompt/grow it). \n\nI would recommend the school evaluate him for dyslexia as that could be one of the reasons why he is avoidant of reading independently.",
