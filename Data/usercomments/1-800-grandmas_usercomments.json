        "body": "I finally read Lonesome Dove this year and bawled my way through it, I absolutely adored it and it\u2019s one of my top 3 all time favorite books for sure. Ever since getting into the Red Dead Redemption universe I\u2019ve been really into westerns and Lonesome Dove was one of my father\u2019s favorite books so I had it on my TBR pile after he passed last year.\n\nI read the other three books in the series and definitely recommend them. Streets Of Laredo disappointed me some, but it did feel like a fitting conclusion in the way it leaves the characters behind, some with hopeful futures, some with nothing. It\u2019s by far the saddest and darkest of the three so if you want to leave it at LD you\u2019ll still get a decent conclusion and your heart will remain more or less intact\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re up for it read Dead Man\u2019s Walk (the first book chronologically in the story) then Comanche Moon, then Lonesome Dove, then Streets of Laredo. But if LD is still fresh in your head you can skip it and go right on to SoL.\n\nI plan to re-read the series in a year or two. It was so stunning.",
