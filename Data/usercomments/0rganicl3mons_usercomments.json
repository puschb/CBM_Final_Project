You might find as you read on that it clicks into place, or you get a feel for why it\u2019s there, even if it never makes literal sense. It\u2019s like a puzzle piece that doesn\u2019t fully fit but still completes the picture.",

The complex structure with multiple stories across time periods and genres works brilliantly on the page, but on screen, it felt jumbled and confusing. I think it\u2019s a case where the story makes more sense in its written form.",
