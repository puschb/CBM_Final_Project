There are things that you would expect to see in demonic cult but the protagonist is written in such a way that it is impossible not to like him. He questions many times what they are doing but at the end always stays loyal to his legion.\n\nIt\u2019s my favorite book. It\u2019s amazing",

With the books I don\u2019t enjoy much I always tell myself \u201cmaybe it will get better\u201d and finish it but now you\u2019re making me questioning if I even want to do that. I\u2019ll try but it\u2019s like you said no need to force anything.",
