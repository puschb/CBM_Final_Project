It's incredible the way he weaves so many stories into one massive narrative. He is educated as an anthropologist and archaeologist and this knowledge shines through in his descriptions of the world, and the peoples that inhabit it. \n\nAlso reading **Howls From The Dark Ages: An Anthology Of Medieval Horor, by various authors, forward by Christopher Buehlman**. There are some gems in this anthology. I've only read one story so far that I didn't much like.",
