        "body": "Rabbits were once crucial to testing for pregnancy, too. Back in the 1920s, doctors would inject a woman's urine into a female rabbit. If the woman was pregnant, the hCG would cause changes in the rabbit's ovaries. The phrase 'the rabbit died' became shorthand for a positive pregnancy test. (The test always required examining the rabbit's ovaries, though, so none survived the \"test.\") It's interesting because not only are they known for sex, but they were known for predicting if humans were pregnant.",
