        "body": "I joined a book club a gazillion years ago when there were 12 women.  We\u2019re now down to 7, one of which lives too far to come to our monthly meetings, and it\u2019s actually very nice being small.  In the beginning, one woman would host the group at her home, providing appetizers, wine, sodas and a dessert, but now we just meet at a restaurant for a couple of hours.  I would say the hard part would be finding other people who love to read as much as you do and going from there.  Even if it\u2019s just 2 people discussing a book together, it\u2019s still enjoyable, right?  In time, you can invite others along.  Many women have come and gone from my club, and that\u2019s just fine - lives get busy and many people \u201cdon\u2019t have time\u201d to read as much as book-lovers make the time to read.  Also, I think it\u2019s important that people know it\u2019s a \u201creal\u201d book club, not a party.  In mine, whoever chose the book leads the discussion (after about 30 minutes of socializing) and has a list of questions to bring about a discussion.  It\u2019s worked well for us.  Maybe you can begin by telling people that you are starting a book club and ask if they have any interest.",

This is a long book and I had not planned on attempting to read it, but once a friend of mine read it and told me how good it was, I bought the audible version, which is read by the author who is EXCELLENT!  Highly recommend!  Oprah does a 6 part podcast interviewing the author, which I just started today and it adds even more to the entire experience.",
