At the time, it was just a book a friend recommended, then a few years later I started seeing it pop up on more and more \"must read\" lists and was ... baffled. It was okay at best. If it didn't have the conceit of the narratives within narratives and the weird typography, I don't think anyone would even remember it. I barely remember it as it is.",
