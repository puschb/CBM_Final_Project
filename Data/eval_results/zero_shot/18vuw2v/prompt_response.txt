    [The post's title]: Barbara Kingsolver appreciation post
    [The post's content]: I have a very unoriginal thing to say - Barbara Kingsolver is a genius. I have been sleeping on Kingsolver and am now almost 20 years late to her work but I am so glad to have found it. Her books are so engrossing and I feel transported in time and space.

I read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days. Then someone on this subreddit recommend Poisonwood Bible as my next endeavor and I have finished that at a rate of knots too. I have Lacuna at home, collecting dust, and will go there immediately after my holiday.

I just needed to share my love for this woman and her books, may she write many more!

I spent a bit of time wandering around the complex looking for the "world\'s biggest book" that I\'d read about in the guide book, only to realise that the whole place was the book.', 'Suggesting that Kim Stanley Robinson has not done much research is bizarre - that\'s the last thing I would think to criticise about his books. I looked again at the chapter. At the very start, it\'s mentioned that the temperature is 38C with high humidity. However this is at 6am.. Later in the chapter, it\'s mentioned that the temperature is now 42C with a humidity of 60% . This equates to a wet bulb temperature of 34.78. You mention that you\'re familiar with the concept of wet bulb temperatures, so you\'ll be aware that the above figure is lethal at prolonged exposure, even to fit adults. The chapter stresses at multiple points that it\'s not the high temperature that is the culprit, but the unusually high humidity. For example: "Bad to have both high heat and high humidity, unusual; in the dry season on the Gangetic plain, January through March, it was cooler and drier; then it grew hot, but was still dry; then with the soaking of the monsoon came cooler temperatures, and omnipresent clouds that gave relief from direct sunlight. This heat wave was different. Cloudless heat and yet high humidity. A terrible combination."', 'New Grub Street by George Gissing']

"I cannot stress enough how underrated Kingsolver is. If you enjoy her writing, I heartily recommend you The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver, which I find even more engrossing than Demon Copperhead. I read it nearly as quickly and I was captivated for the whole book. It's a masterpiece which I couldn't put down. I'm eagerly starting The Lacuna now, and I hope she continues writing her magical stories for years to come."

    "Kingsolver is indeed a brilliant author, I thoroughly agree. I've always felt that reading should take you on a journey not just to different locations but different periods too and she does that magnificently.

The Poisonwood Bible takes place in the Republic of Congo in the mid 1960s but also covers themes like conflict, cultural differences,

I'd love to chime in with an agreeable take. This is the first time I've encountered Kingsolver, and I have to confess that I'm kicking myself for not discovering her sooner. After devouring Demon Copperhead, I'm now en route to Poisonwood Bible. It's a bit disconcerting to realize that I've missed out on her genius for almost twenty years! Lacuna will be next on my list, and I'm hoping it will transport me just as profoundly as her other works. Cheers to Barbara Kingsolver and her incredible storytelling abilities!
    It's unfortunate that some literary works don't resonate with everyone, but it just means there's even more to explore in the vast world of literature. Here's to finding our own gems!</s>

[My comment as the mimicked user]: Just realized I still haven't mentioned *The Lacuna* to anyone yet. I might be late to the party, but I can't sing the praises of this book enough. The complexity and depth of the characters, alongside the historical context, really draws you in.

I have a feeling that I'll want to reread it after finishing it, to really immerse myself in the details. I'm so glad Barbara Kingsolver wrote this masterpiece, and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!

You: Me too, I've been meaning to read more of Kingsolver's work for years now. I read her book Animal Dreams way back when and it was excellent. I can't believe I've let her other books sit on my shelf for so long. I'll move Demon Copperhead and Poisonwood Bible up my TBR list for sure!

    As for limiting bookshelves, I actually just invested in a new bookshelf to accommodate all the amazing books I've collected over the years. Maybe I should start being a bit pickier about what I let in...

    And as for others, I'm not sure what you mean about LeGuin and anarchism. I'll have to look into that somewhere else, but I do know that she's a fantastic writer. Here's hoping that Kingsolver keeps writing for a long time to come too!</s>

[Response]: I couldn't agree more! She has a wonderful ability to immersive readers into her narratives. I recently finished 'The Poisonwood Bible' and was completely captivated. As others have mentioned, her characters are complex and truly come to life on the page. I've always appreciated the level of detail Kingsolver puts into her work, which I believe adds to the richness of her stories. I'm currently working through 'Lacuna' and anxiously awaiting the next chapter in the lives of Karolina and Tao.

As a side note, I've been meaning to revisit 'War and Peace' for perhaps the 5th or 6th time. I love the depth of the characters and the historical context, but it is sometimes a bit of a slog to get through, especially in long sitting. I remember being thoroughly amused by the funny and relatable parts, though. You

When I was in middle school, one of our teachers set us a creative writing assignment in which we were to kill off our teachers in the most creative way we could think of. Another a couple years before had us writing a story in which our class was shipwrecked on a desert island. For the first few weeks there was a rule that all characters had to remain alive, but eventually he said we could start killing people off. As you can perhaps imagine, we all relished both assignments. It‚Äôs weird to think back on, but it was a different time. My senior year, a friend and I wrote out a list of who we were going to let live when we took over the world. It was not a long list. It was also not at all serious. If teachers had seen it, they would have rolled their eyes. A year later, we would have been expelled.', 'Yup. I can remember exactly where I was sitting, everything. It hit so hard.']

_"I remember the Columbine massacre vividly. I was a teenager at the time, and I remember being in disbelief when I first heard about it. Back then, it was a different time. We were growing up in a world that seemed less safe, especially for those of us in high school. But somehow, despite the world turning upside down, art continued to thrive, and Barbara Kingsolver's work was one of the beacons of hope during those dark times. I'm glad she could still create masterpieces that transported us to other worlds, if only for a brief moment"_</s>

    I'm off to read Lacuna after my holiday and I'm excited to dive back into her enchanting worlds! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®</s>

I read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days.

While I can't say I share the same enthusiasm for Piranesi as I've heard it described, I absolutely adore Demon Copperhead and The Poisonwood Bible. I'm currently on the fence about reading Lacuna, but I'll be sure to get to it eventually. I just can't seem to appreciate Piranesi as others have. It left me wanting more, and not in a good way."_

     _"I can't imagine what others see in Piranesi, but each person has their own taste, of course. Still, I'm genuinely glad that Kingsolver's work is helping you tap into a world of imagination. Here's to many more stories from her!"_</s>

The pieces I am, she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order. It\'s good, you know, when you got a woman who is a friend of your mind." From *Phantastes* by George MacDonald: ‚ÄúAs in all sweetest music, a tinge of sadness was in every note. Nor do we know how much of the pleasures even of life we owe to the intermingled sorrows. Joy cannot unfold the deepest truths, although deepest truth must be deepest joy.‚Äù', 'For me it‚Äôs a toss-up between Emma and Mansfield Park, but really I think they‚Äôre all equally good in their own ways and it comes down to personal preferences.', '*A Mercy* is one of the most heartbreaking books I‚Äôve ever read; it‚Äôs right up there with *Beloved* as my favorite Toni Morrison. I remember crying so hard over it that my head hurt the next day.', 'This isn‚Äôt a genre exactly, but I have a lot more patience than most people for books with a lot of rambling and tangents‚ÄîGeorge MacDonald‚Äôs work in general and *The French Lieutenant‚Äôs Woman* by John Fowles are the ones coming to mind, but there are definitely others I‚Äôm not thinking of at the moment. I totally understand why some people prefer books that stick mainly to the story rather than philosophizing or adding unnecessary anecdotes or whatever, but I actually find that stuff pretty fun as long as the author‚Äôs writing appeals to me.', 'I personally like her other work more than Mrs. Dalloway, but also I think she‚Äôs the kind of author who just doesn‚Äôt appeal to everybody. It‚Äôs less about plot and more about feelings and vibes‚ÄîI find it really rich and interesting, but I can see why a lot of people dislike her.', 'Me, too. I think about the harmoniums on a daily basis and I actually have tentative plans to paint a mural inspired by them in my house, lol. I love Vonnegut in general but Sirens was by far the most impactful of his books for me.', 'I can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll so far to find this! I get why Lolita is the best known because it‚Äôs ~controversial~ but Pale Fire is a masterpiece, and I also love Invitation to a Beheading.', 'I love *Beloved* so much. Toni Morrison really had a gift for portraying human emotions in a way that makes the reader feel things right along with the character. I think what I love most about the book is that as tragic and heartbreaking as it is, there are still glimmers of hope, because at its heart it feels like a book about people who have been through unimaginable trauma but still find it in themselves to care for each other.', 'I actually have a massive soft spot for *Rocannon‚Äôs World*. It‚Äôs not the most complex or impressive, but there‚Äôs something so haunting about it and I find myself thinking about it more often than any of the others.', 'Yeah, it‚Äôs definitely a remarkable book. I think what killed me was that the main character would never *know* that her mother gave her up out of hope that she‚Äôd have a better life‚Äîshe lived her whole life believing she wasn‚Äôt wanted. It wasn‚Äôt all bad though; there were some really touching moments of compassion and humanity.']

"You truly must start with either "The Poisonwood Bible" or "Animal Dreams". Both are stunning works that showcase her brilliant storytelling and rich characters. If you lean towards historical fiction, the former is a captivating tale set in the Belgian Congo. For a more intimate, contemporary narrative, the latter is a profound exploration of the American Southwest. Both are exceptional!"</s>

Elizabeth overheard Darcy‚Äôs opinion of her at their first meeting, but his feelings change and she doesn‚Äôt perceive it. Meanwhile, he doesn‚Äôt realize that she has a low opinion of him and believes it to be mutual. So while she thinks they‚Äôre united in mutual dislike, he thinks they‚Äôve both grown to like each other. The funniest lines in my opinion are shortly before the proposal when she‚Äôs staying with the Collin‚Äôs and runs into him when out walking. She takes care to inform him that this grove is her favorite place to walk, and is utterly perplexed that she‚Äôd run into him a second time and a third. Of course as you point out, once they begin to actually discuss things, they‚Äôre much better at it.', 'Oh that‚Äôs not an unpopular opinion!

Meanwhile, he‚Äôs utterly miserable at said job. They end up switching roles after an accident leaves the husband in a wheelchair, and they each thrive in the other‚Äôs ‚Äúnatural‚Äù world, but with the leaden understanding that they‚Äôd be hugely looked down upon if not for the wheelchair making it a necessity. It feels like something written in the 1960‚Äôs, or like a period piece written later but set in this time, with modern ideas superimposed upon it.

The characters are complex and relatable, and the story is both captivating and thought-provoking. I find myself reflecting on it long after I've finished reading. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good literary novel."

Bonus points if wins a man's respect for it. Even easier if she shuts down a nagging feminist in the process. Triple hitter if her own theory is lightly sexist.", "I'm not referring to the use of the word savages. I mean his discussing their having a childish joy at the thought of scalping someone, held up in comparison to his own desire for a university education.", 'Good grief. Do you also have an additional explanation for what makes it totally appropriate to lean into the racist stereotype of childishness?', 'I do read, I just tend not to prefer children\'s lit. I talk about it because it\'s the job of adults to talk about books given to children. Nowhere did I say "racist" was the end of the discussion, in fact I literally called for giving it to children nonetheless with MORE discussion. But part of that discussion has to involve saying the tough part out loud. Mark Twain was pretty racist.', 'I agree with you up to a point, but I\'d also like to add that if you are engaging with this kind of content or having a young person do so, it\'s important to do research and have a conversation. A lot of early Cowboys & Indians literature is racist as fuck. Depiction doesn\'t always equal endorsement but SOMETIMES IT DEFINITELY DOES: one character of dubious judgement saying racist things isn\'t bad, but when you truck in the stereotype that some dirty savage cannibal is going to eat/rape/scalp some damsel unless the big strong white dude comes along and saves her and heroically and wittily says something racist while doing so then you\'ve worked your narrative to endorse his beliefs. You\'re looking at endorsement. Native Americans and Mark Twain are a good example. This is the author who wrote "nothing but a poor filthy, naked scurvy vagabond, whom to exterminate were a charity to the Creator\'s worthier insects and reptiles which he oppresses." Not in fiction, mind you- himself, as an essayist. "A little racist" for calling Native Americans lower than bugs and lizards and calling it a kindness to god to kill them? You say he got better but in 1907 he said ‚ÄúA university degree is a prize that I would go far to get at any time. I take the same childlike delight in a new degree that an Indian takes in a fresh scalp, and I take no more pains to conceal my joy than the Indian does.‚Äù He died in 1910. That might be better but it\'s still racist as fuck. I don\'t think we throw out Mark Twain. I do think we go back and re-look at the arcs of the stories of those early books before you lend them to the generation down and have a real, hard, unflinching reread to figure out whether you\'re dealing with depiction OR endorsement. Then, react accordingly, from a place unclouded by sentimentality. Maybe they just need to be saved for when young people reach a reading level where they are more capable of being suspicious of the agenda of the author. I can tell you I read those books in school age 9 and remember getting a talking to from the teacher about never using the n-word, and that worked great. I don\'t know if Native Americans just didn\'t come up in the one we read, but I hope if they had there\'d have been a bigger conversation about hateful and dehumanizing stereotypes.', 'That\'s not remotely how I read it. The books do have a lot of characters with mental health issues in them but it\'s all very "there\'s no door into happiness because wherever you go, then there you\'ll be."', 'Exactly. I\'ve read everything Lovecraft has written, you\'re dead right about his politics. I can enjoy reading him and not go "everyone MUUUUST." Or pretend he was anything other than what he was.', 'Easy too to resist judging your favourites because it\'s uncomfortable to do so. Fun fact, I just googled to see what his most recent take on Native American characters in fiction was and got Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer among the Indians, in which "..a group of Sioux warriors befriend them but then slaughters the Mills boys and their parents, carrying off the two daughters, Peggy and Flaxy..." I\'ll give Twain a little bit of a pass on it since he set up the premise in a short written when he was alive and it was only completed posthumously. But he\'s an author who started his career overtly genocidal and only softened into racist as his virulently racist peers. It shaped his writing into stories that overtly endorse racist attitudes. There\'s still value in reading his stuff, I even love some of it and have a few of his quotes I draw on constantly. But I don\'t think there\'s any value in pretending he wasn\'t racist enough to deserve to be judged.', "I mean... Yes and no. It kicked off a burst of mania but there are passages when he's in school where he's bitterly depressed. Then when he graduates he dives head long into self-medicating and alcoholism. Plum outright calls him a wine-lush in her POV section, Eliot overtly worries about his mental health in his POV section...", "Never read it! Loved the Road, loved No Country for Old Men. I'll add it to my list though, thanks, if it comes up in this context it's bound to at least be interesting üòâ"]

> I did read her books when they came out. I read her novels at the time of their release and even gave her a book for Christmas one year. Her novels were an intellectual breath of fresh air at the time. Now, decades later, it's disturbing to see how many of her books are soaked in her outdated, regressive views on gender and sexuality. It's a shame because the narrative and prose was often excellent.
    
    I didn't realize there was so much controversy around Kingsolver. I've been lucky enough not to run into any of those issues in Demon Copperhead or Poisonwood Bible, so I still feel that she is a genius. But I do agree with the commenter that her outdated views on gender and sexuality are disappointing to see in her work. It's disheartening to know that the author of such brilliant stories and characters has such regressive

    [The post's content]: I have a very unoriginal thing to say - Barbara Kingsolver is a genius. I have been sleeping on Kingsolver and am now almost 20 years late to her work but I am so glad to have found it. Her books are so engrossing and I feel transported in time and space.

I read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days. Then someone on this subreddit recommend Poisonwood Bible as my next endeavor and I have finished that at a rate of knots too. I have Lacuna at home, collecting dust, and will go there immediately after my holiday.

I just needed to share my love for this woman and her books, may she write many more!

‡≤†_‡≤† I'm glad I stumbled upon Barbara Kingsolver, my new favorite author. Her books are captivating and I can't believe I slept on them for so long. I just finished Demon Copperhead and couldn't wait to dive into Poisonwood Bible.

I've heard great things about Lacuna but it's been sitting on my shelf for a while now. It's time to give it a read!

Side note: I remember one of you mentioning an author who wrote about an irate teen and it reminded me of Richard Bachman. But I'm glad I gave him a chance because his books are fantastic! So, keep recommending, I'll keep reading! üëçüèΩ</s>

I'm currently engrossed in The Lacuna, following my mom's relentless recommendation. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. If only Kingsolver could continue to produce masterpieces indefinitely! ü§û

    A side note, after reading Demon Copperhead, I couldn't help but draw parallels with Elizabeth and Darcy's misunderstandings in Pride and Prejudice. Such a delightful fusion of the literary and the modern! Keep enjoying the books!"</s>

I'm so glad to see the love for Barbara Kingsolver! I'm a bit jealous, actually. I've been reading Kingsolver for years now, ever since my mom couldn't stop talking about Demon Copperhead. I must admit, I was hesitant at first, but when I finally picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Now I'm on a Kingsolver kick, I've got Poisonwood Bible and Lacuna piled high on my nightstand - with a copy of The Poisonwood Bible waiting patiently for my holiday vacation to start. I've gotta say, though, Lacuna is my favorite. There's something about the way she weaves the narrative and the themes that really speaks to me. It's like she's telling a story that's been hidden away for years, just waiting to be discovered. If you've got any favorite Kingsolver books, please share

I couldn't agree more! I was lucky to discover Barbara Kingsolver through Demon Copperhead, but The Poisonwood Bible is another masterpiece of hers. I simply can't wait to read Lacuna next. I'm amazed she's not more widely known and celebrated. It's a shame we don't have more women authors dominating the industry like Kingsolver!

In terms of that study on women's speaking rates and dominance, it feels so apt when discussing the male/female author ratio in literature. I can't help but feel that a balance would be desirable. 

By the way, does anyone else find themselves narrating their inner monologue while reading or does that only happen to a select few? I've always wondered if I'm the odd one out or not.

P.S. Have you read Life After Life by Kate Atkinson? Absolutely

    [User's comment history]: ['I love "cozy sci-fi" for this very reason. I want something interest enough to keep me reading, but I want it to have a happy ending with likable characters. I highly recommend Becky Chambers as an author. She has a four-part series and a two-part (so far) series.

People are constantly on speaker phone everywhere, or listening to their music out loud at all times. On hikes, at the doctor\'s office, etc. The library SHOULD be a quiet zone, but people are clueless and it wouldn\'t occur to them that this public space, above all else, should have different rules. I also think it has a lot to do with the lack of third spaces in general. My local library branch is always noisy because there\'s always a group of 10-15 year olds hanging out there. And where else are they supposed to go? The weather is cold now where I live, can\'t go to the park. Nobody under the age of 16 is allowed at the mall without a parent. The one community center at the YMCA requires kids to cross a major highway to get to, so if you don\'t go to school on that side of town, good luck. Librarians are saints for being unpaid babysitters. Not that this SHOULD be their job, but the reality is that libraries are one of the few public spaces that is even remotely kid friendly. And unsupervised kids are loud. I also think there\'s something to be said about the fact that we still don\'t think of the internet as a utility. There are programs for electricity and cell phones, but not for home internet (or, at least, not nearly as many or wide-spread). That brings more and more people into the library as the only place they can do what they need to do online. They aren\'t there to read or browse, they are there to fill out a job app or do a zoom interview or check their email. Those activities used to be either an at home thing or a "internet cafe" thing, and if that\'s the only reason you use the library, you don\'t necessarily see it as an activity that requires hushed voices.', 'The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell. I have yet to find another sci fi book that has risen to the level of this book for me. The characters, the world-building, the writing, it\'s just....sublime. The narrative structure also appeals to me - you find out within the first chapter of the book that only one person makes it back from the "mission", so you spend the rest of the story falling in love with characters that you KNOW don\'t make it. But you just have to know HOW.', 'Yes, I feel like I have learned a bunch without taking notes. Highlighting never actually did anything for me to retain knowledge, even while in college. Writing notes (pen on paper, not typing) DID help me retain information, but I needed to do that because my grade depended on it. My reading comprehension and retention has always been very high, so I retain a lot of info just from listening to it or reading it once. But I\'m also not super worried if I "lose" some of what I learned in the long-haul. No one is quizzing me on this info; in fact, I tend to info-dump onto people whether they want to know or not. If I let go of something I read in a podcast to make room for something new, I\'m fine with that. Things I\'ve learned that have been truly life-changing (such as topics around anti-racism) are too big to be lost completely even if I never take a single note. It just makes my brain happy to learn a new fact, even if that fact flutters away from my brain later.', "I do a LOT of skimming. Any time my brain wants to move the plot along, I just hit fast-forward in my brain and skim. This is fine for most books, because I'm reading for the plot / character development, not the prose. It's harder with historical fiction or sci-fi/fantasy, where filler prose is necessary for world-building. But if it's a contemporary fiction book? I'm skimming over anything that bores me."]

"This post brought a tear to my eye. Thank you for sharing your love for Barbara Kingsolver's work. I too have been a long-time admirer of her genius. I remember devouring Animal Dreams in high school and it felt like I was reading one of the greatest pieces of literature of our times. I've since read almost everything she's written and will undoubtedly continue to do so.

    For those who haven't experienced her work yet, I wholeheartedly second the recommendation of The Poisonwood Bible. It's an absolute masterpiece.

    As for other authors, I can't recommend Becky Chambers' "Wayfarers" series enough. It's perfect for anyone looking for cozy sci-fi with happy endings and likable characters. I discovered her work a few years ago and it has become one of my favorite series.

    [The post's content]: I have a very unoriginal thing to say - Barbara Kingsolver is a genius. I have been sleeping on Kingsolver and am now almost 20 years late to her work but I am so glad to have found it. Her books are so engrossing and I feel transported in time and space.

I read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days. Then someone on this subreddit recommend Poisonwood Bible as my next endeavor and I have finished that at a rate of knots too. I have Lacuna at home, collecting dust, and will go there immediately after my holiday.

"Excellent choices! After Demon Copperhead and Poisonwood Bible, I'd recommend The Poisonwood Bible for anyone looking for a rich, immersive reading experience. As for The Things They Carried, it's a must-read for anyone interested in the complexities of war. If you're in the mood for another gripping narrative from a talented author, I'd suggest giving The Luminaries a try."</s>

I love the way she transports you to different worlds while still managing to tackle complex societal issues. I haven't read Demon Copperhead yet, but I've heard fantastic things about it.

It's always impressive when someone discovers an amazing author a little late, but still manages to catch up and appreciate them fully. Kingsolver is indeed a genius, and I'm glad your mom recommended her. I'll have to suggest some other great reads by her to you. I remember, as a kid, my mom used to read aloud to us at bedtime, and it was such a calming and enjoyable experience. It's something I still miss to this day.

I also appreciate the love for used bookstores. I spend countless hours lost in their labyrinths. If you haven't read The Little Prince, you should definitely give it a try. I've added Night Flight to my list. Thanks for the recommendation!

On a side note, I've grown fond of graphic novels and particularly enjoy Sandman. I find it a refreshing change of pace from traditional novels.</s>

Barbara Kingsolver's prose is unquestionably captivating. Her ability to create immersive worlds and transport her readers is truly a gift and something I deeply appreciate. I've only just scratched the surface of her bibliography, but I'm eager to dive deeper. Protagonist or supporting character, Kingsolver's characters feel so real, and as a reader, I can't help but connect with them on an emotional level. I'd strongly recommend her novels to anyone looking for a masterfully crafted story. Keep writing, Ms. Kingsolver!</s>

I loved the way it tied everything together without anything feeling forced or wrapped up too neatly. And all of the characters and stories were so affecting. On a side note, Florida isn‚Äôt supposed to be a novel. It‚Äôs just a collection of short stories. I loved that one too but definitely would have been puzzled and disappointed if I were expecting them to all somehow come together in the end!', 'Do you mean The Collector by John Fowles? If so, I totally agree with you. That book is mesmerizing.', 'They get a bit worse with each book. I‚Äôd say the first three are still worth reading, but after that, it really falls apart.', 'Sure! A couple that immediately come to mind are Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft, which is a resource for people in abusive relationships (and for anyone who wants to understand the dynamics of intimate partner abuse better) and Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay Gibson, which is a guide for healing and growing and moving on from wounds leftover from childhood, as well as setting and maintaining healthy boundaries and building healthy relationships in the present. I could name others that I think are genuinely helpful as well, but I picked those two specifically because I‚Äôve lost count of the number of times I‚Äôve heard someone say they learned something from one of them that has helped them make a serious, lasting, positive change in their life.

The books you‚Äôre describing as helpful are the types of books that are written by highly qualified subject matter experts, and they are based in evidence and practice.

OP‚Äôs post is like saying fiction is stupid and not worth anyone‚Äôs time when the only novel you‚Äôve ever heard of is 50 Shades of Grey.', 'This is how I found nearly all my books in the days before the internet was how it is now (with the advent of social media, Wikipedia, Amazon, etc.).

In general, its more like the timeline is a mess considering that its shifting through time, not just POVs Thats what I would do tbh. Hold off for a bit and then look at it with new eyes.

And then, when they gave the book back to me it was all stained red and wrinkled because of a homemade soap I had made them leaked in their bag. They blamed me/said it was my own fault for giving them that, but that only made me more bitter about the whole thing. We're still friends because I was a bit of a wimp back then and they were sort of an ass back then, but I've only just managed to start to get over what they did (Especially cause when I tried to do the same to them, like take a book I wanted to read out of their hands in the same year, they got mad at me!!

Thank you for sharing your love for Barbara Kingsolver! I couldn't agree more; her work is truly enchanting and the way she transports her readers is remarkable. The Demon Copperhead was a delight to read, and I'm excited to tackle Poisonwood Bible next. I admire her ability to create such immersive, captivating stories. As many have pointed out, Kingsolver's books often resonate deeply with readers, and her impact on literature is significant. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who has discovered her brilliance later in life. Keeping our fingers crossed for more of her brilliant literature!

On a side note, your comment about all fiction lying brought to mind the way Kingsolver's stories often blur the line between fact and fiction, creating a unique literary experience. Keep on reading and exploring, my friend!</s>

And the legendary tunnels under downtown. And the hot springs. Other things he got wrong could have been corrected with a basic map (the survivors left a small town and headed east to Boise, but that town is north-east of Boise).

*"Ah, another Barbara Kingsolver fan here. I've been on a Kingsolver kick myself lately, after much prodding from my wife. I must say, I'm now a convert. The world-building in her books is so immersive, you can taste the earth beneath her characters' feet. Demon Copperhead was a captivating read, and I can't wait to dive into Poisonwood Bible. That said, I do have to give a shout-out to Lou Cadle's Gray. It's a gripping post-apocalyptic tale set in Idaho, with a university campus as one of the few surviving strongholds. There's a bit of creative license taken, though. I couldn't help but notice that Cadle missed out on a few key Idaho landmarks, like the tunnels under downtown Boise, the hot springs, and the 10-story brick hospital

    [The post's title]: Barbara Kingsolver appreciation post
    [The post's content]: I have a very unoriginal thing to say - Barbara Kingsolver is a genius. I have been sleeping on Kingsolver and am now almost 20 years late to her work but I am so glad to have found it. Her books are so engrossing and I feel transported in time and space.

I read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days. Then someone on this subreddit recommend Poisonwood Bible as my next endeavor and I have finished that at a rate of knots too. I have Lacuna at home, collecting dust, and will go there immediately after my holiday.

I just needed to share my love for this woman and her books, may she write many more!

"That's great to hear! I also found her books extremely captivating and immersive. I think Demon Copperhead and Poisonwood Bible are fantastic choices if you're just starting out. If you haven't already, I'd definitely recommend giving Lacuna a read. I've been meaning to reread some of her books too, especially on audiobook. There are just so many classics I love to revisit. Cheers to many more books from such a talented writer!"

    [User's comment history]: ['Only a couple make a bad taste in my mouth. *Darling Rose Gold* by Stephanie Wrobel I checked out of my school library when I was doing a creative nonfiction piece on Munchausens by Proxy. Even though it was fiction, I figured it couldn\'t hurt to read it. As I read it though I quickly realized it was like fanfiction of Gypsy Rose Blanchard\'s life. What put the bad taste in my mouth was that this was a real person, who was abused to high hell and put in prison because she killed her abuser, who was still in prison at the time this book was published, and this author was going to write a fictional book based on that abuse and trauma? Also the fact that the names were barely changed, as well as certain circumstances, pissed me off. And the cherry on top was that it was originally written for the author\'s thesis on MBP, I believe, and then the author wanted to get it published officially. I don\'t care if Gypsy Rose makes money off of her situation, because its her situation. This women making money off of it is just in poor taste imo. Another book did the same thing as this, except I didn\'t know it until years later when I had to search up the information. I don\'t remember the title but it was about a blind girl who was kidnapped in the back of a car when it was being hijacked. When I had read it, I loved it, I thought the premise was so unique and exciting. It made me a little sick to find out so much later that it was based on actual events. My question is, unless you get explicit permission from the person, why in the world would you want to rewrite their trauma and history?? Its different if a significant amount of time has past, and if there isn\'t much known about a person except speculation. If you\'re writing a biography, fine, whatever. But why in the world would you look at a real event that happened to a real person, who is still alive and affected by that event!, and "fictionalize" it??? That just screams "I\'m not very creative and I\'m not a good writer" to me, I\'m sorry.', "I'm the same way about book treatment. It was really engrained in me as a kid that you take care of books, probably because I spent so much time at the library. I think there's a good balance of learning to let people do what they want with their possessions but also make sure they know they can't do that with every book they encounter, especially those they don't own. Which you'd *think* would be obvious, but there are a LOT of entitled people out there. I'm always working under the assumption that people are good, but when it comes to younger kids, I don't think it goes amiss to teach how to treat a book well because it goes well into lessons about how to treat other people's stuff well.", "Yeah I already had trouble reading the Bone Witch and its 2 switching POVs, I still haven't read The Shadowglass yet because I feel like I need to reread the first two books to figure out what all is happening", 'I feel so bad for the author but in the original hardcover of The Heart Forger by Rin Chupeco, there were 2 spots where it looked like paragraphs were accidentally merged, because two people were saying different things but it looked like one person was saying it. It was such an egregious error and the worst I had ever seen in an officially published book', "Pretty much agree with all comments Don't yuck others yum, American Puritanical values suckass, there is a weird genuine problem of increasingly adult books being categorized as YA or advertised to YA demographic (and younger) etc etc My personal beef is with the people who just can't admit they're reading erotica. I literally don't give a crap what you read, but don't try recommending smutty books like they're any other genre, its erotica babes. Just because it takes place in a fantasy land doesn't not make it erotica. Just embrace the sex and deal with it", "Aside from typical early writing mess ups, Rick was not the most... *aware* author out there, which is something he has really tried to make up for in every subsequent series post PJO as well as his Riordan presents stuff, but its still there in his early works and he's still not the best at portraying minority groups. Ex. In The Lightning Thief, Medusa is described in a very non PC way I believe, and the fact that she was a villian hiding under their noses didn't help either.", "Ok I have to go check my StoryGraph real quick. In 2023, 30/91 books I read I owned. Of those, about 6 were gifted to me and another ~6 I had already owned and were rereads. Also quite a few of them were manga. Oh, and I bought 8 books at the tail end of December because the B&N near me was having a blowout sale, but I haven't read them all yet. And if I went further back into 2022 and 2021, there are LOT of books I had already owned and bought previously, either new or used, and didn't read until then because that's when I finally started focusing on reading my physical TBR. So I honesty don't know how many books I buy each year. Some I read right away, several are gifted to me in bulk at birthday/Christmas, some I sit on for years before reading. I've just started collecting the Heros of Olympus books in hardcover used, but I've already read them all and own them all on my Nook, I just really wanted physical copies. And, I'm not going to reread them until I have them all, so I have no clue when I'm going to get to them (all I need is Son of Neptune but my used bookstore is totally out of Riordan stuff now because of the show T_T)", 'I\'ve only read Babel and Yellow Face and loved both. I\'ve regretted before going "backwards" through an authors works, so I\'m probably never going to read Poppy Wars. But I will say, you can definitely tell Kuang is getting better and better at her craft', "Depends on who writes it, what book its in/what its for, if it seems interesting or enriching, etc etc Usually no, I'll say though", "Rick himself admits that he didn't do the best at representation and you notice how in the show she doesn't look how she was described in the book? Also, what is Middle Eastern? More than anything she was described as a Muslim woman, I believe wearing some sort of head covering. Just think about it for a second. The Lightning Thief came out in 2005, just 4 years after 9/11. It was not at all uncommon to write Muslim people as villians in shows, movies, and books. Rick actually wants to correct his initial errors because he's a great guy"]

"Barbara Kingsolver is the exception to the problem with fictionally rewriting trauma. I've noticed many authors who use real events as the basis for their stories, often without the permission of those who were involved or affected by those events, disregarding the pain that their stories may cause and the appropriation of the events for their own gain. Unlike some of these authors, Barbara Kingsolver's writing feels genuinely empathetic and respectful, even if it is based on real events. Kingsolver's ability to transport the reader and immerse them in the characters and setting of her stories, while still being able to address complex and often difficult topics, sets her apart from many other authors. Her books are a reminder of the power of storytelling and the ability to use that power for good. "</s>

    Wow, you're making me feel old here. I'm actually quite surprised I haven't stumbled upon this author before.

    [The post's content]: I have a very unoriginal thing to say - Barbara Kingsolver is a genius. I have been sleeping on Kingsolver and am now almost 20 years late to her work but I am so glad to have found it. Her books are so engrossing and I feel transported in time and space.

I read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days.

They blamed me/said it was my own fault for giving them that, but that only made me more bitter about the whole thing. We're still friends because I was a bit of a wimp back then and they were sort of an ass back then, but I've only just managed to start to get over what they did (Especially cause when I tried to do the same to them, like take a book I wanted to read out of their hands in the same year, they got mad at me!!

I couldn't agree more! Her books have a captivating quality that keeps me absorbed for hours at a time. I've just finished "The Bean Trees" and I can't wait to delve into more of her work. I've heard a lot of praise for "Pigs in Heaven" and "The Poisonwood Bible" as well, so I'm planning to read those next.

Kingsolver's writing is simply mesmerizing, she weaves a rich tapestry of characters and settings that stay with me long after I've turned the last page. Her novels feel like windows into different worlds, and I always come away feeling enriched.

I've always been partial to used books too, there's something special about owning a story that has been cherished by someone else before. I love imagining the previous reader, their thoughts, and their reactions to certain scenes or

    [The post's title]: Barbara Kingsolver appreciation post
    [The post's content]: I have a very unoriginal thing to say - Barbara Kingsolver is a genius. I have been sleeping on Kingsolver and am now almost 20 years late to her work but I am so glad to have found it. Her books are so engrossing and I feel transported in time and space.

I read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days. Then someone on this subreddit recommend Poisonwood Bible as my next endeavor and I have finished that at a rate of knots too. I have Lacuna at home, collecting dust, and will go there immediately after my holiday.

I just needed to share my love for this woman and her books, may she write many more!

    Hi there, fellow Kingsolver fan!

    I'm so glad to find another admirer of Kingsolver's genius! Demon Copperhead was truly a captivating read, and I can't wait to dive into Poisonwood Bible next. I've heard such amazing things about it, and I can't help but feel that I've been missing out for too long!

[User 1]: Hey, I found this post while looking for a different author and was pleasantly surprised to see Kinsolver being celebrated here! I know Demon Copperhead and The Lacuna were already mentioned, but have you read Flannery O'Connor's The Violent Bear It Away? It's a wonderful book about faith, family, and moral ambiguity. I feel like it's a good companion read for Kinsolver's works. 
    [User 2]: Oh no, I just bought it. I'll move it up in my reading list as soon as I have a bit more time. Thanks for the recommendation!
    [User 1]: Haha, no problem! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. She brings a unique take on Southern Gothic literature, and I feel like it complements Barbara Kingsolver's powerful narrative voice rather nicely.

"Ah, I understand your enthusiasm! I just picked up Demon Copperhead a few weeks ago and absolutely loved it. Have you read Prodigal Summer, it's one of her stand-outs, in my opinion.
    
     Also, if you can get your hands on an older copy of the Poisonwood Bible, it has some beautiful water color illustrations by Billy Collins sprinkled throughout. Makes the experience even more immersive.

     I'm off to start Home After Dark now, looking forward to see where Kingsolver goes with this story. Happy reading!"

Reading is a hobby where all the productivity is intellectual, emotional and internal. It\'s not like baking a cake or building a model where you have a finished product to show. It\'s not even like hiking or walking where you can take pictures of it. So this is a way for people who need it to show achievement. Personally, I don\'t think you can quantify what reading gives you. I think it\'s more important to read books that give you something, whatever you happen to seek from them. Some people really like to unwind with thrillers, romance, mystery or cozy books that you blast through fairly quickly, so reading War and Peace wouldn\'t meet their needs.

"I see I'm preaching to the choir on this one - it's absolutely amazing how Barbara Kingsolver can transport you to a different time and place through her books. I'm glad your mom recommended Demon Copperhead to you! I also have to second the recommendation for Poisonwood Bible. I've read it multiple times and it always hits differently. I think the next one to tackle after Lacuna would be The Bean Trees or Animal Dreams for a bit more of a contemporary feel. Keep up the good reads!"</s>

But I loved the prose, I loved the world building, and I loved the bdsm. I was always a little sad we didn't get to see a lot of kinks outside that realm, though.

"*Hear! Hear! Someone else appreciates Barbara Kingsolver! I, too, was introduced late to her work and I'm now kicking myself for not discovering her sooner. Her books are truly captivating, and Demon Copperhead is no exception. In fact, it may be my new favorite. It's such a gripping, emotional rollercoaster that I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it. I'm currently halfway through Flight Behavior and I can already tell it's going to be another winner.*

*But don't just take my word for it. Go read her books and let Barbara Kingsolver transport you to a world of intrigue, emotion, and beautifully crafted prose! Long live the queen of contemporary literature!"*
