    "content": "By this I basically mean, a book that was marketed as one thing and either didn\u2019t live up to what was promised or was something else entirely. I feel this is very common practise especially nowadays due to the rise of TikTok leading a lot of books to be simplified down to their tropes. A book I feel was marketed incorrectly is probably Song Of Achillies by Madeline Miller. I read the UK edition of this book, and on the cover the book is described as being \u2018dark\u2019 and \u2018sexy\u2019. After having read the book this is pretty disturbing given that the only sexual scenes take place when the characters are very young / underage (all others fade to black). Not to mention one of the scenes is purposefully very uncomfortable. Maybe that\u2019s a desperate discussion for the sexualisation of queer relationships, it just especially disturbed me with TOSA. It\u2019s a very beautiful book by all means, but why is it marketed as being \u2018sexy\u2019 when it really isn\u2019t that at all, though maybe it\u2019s just marketed that way in the UK. What books to you feel weren\u2019t marketed correctly?",

Some people can't separate diversity politics from anything involving diverse characters so they lie because they feel personally attacked if the book sells badly or something. Something to consider(doesn't excuse bad behavior, but it can help to understand the mindset behind it) is that people are afraid such books are going to become a passing trend. That if the straight folk aren't buying them anymore, they're going to be deemed not worth it to publish, and will fade away. Those of us who were teens in the 00s and before remember how hard it used to be to find good queer lit. There were like two authors who were actively publishing and you could reliably find on shelves: Julie Ann Peters wrote sapphic stories, and Alex Sanchez wrote about gay boys(he pissed me off in the first book though so I wouldn't read his stuff). So there's a very real fear that we might be forced back to that, if the winds change. People say it's not possible, but they said a lot of things weren't possible that have happened over the past few years, so...*yeah*. And some people react to that fear and anxiety(especially given how close to the edge we're pushed with everything else happening these days) with the best defense: a good offense. And it's confusing to people who don't know where it's coming from, because why is this person upset? It doesn't seem to make sense why they're taking it so personally. But it's not really *about* one person liking or not liking the book. It's about the threat that person happens to be representing.",

They just happen to also be about\u2026a LOT more than that.

I do highly recommend Floralinda and the forty flight tower though, particularly the audiobook as the narrator nails the characters and the style of the story. To be sure there are no mischaracterisations it is about a princess locked atop a tower by a witch for princes to come rescue, unfortunately she takes an avant-garde approach to her monster line up so the princess eventually has to take matters into her own hands.

I wanted first and foremost to know what was happening.\u00a0 The author does not tell us. It\u2019s one thing to choose an ambiguous ending. I can handle that. But he deliberately used an omniscient perspective and was constantly dropping hints about what was happening outside the bubble where the family was. Then he doesn\u2019t tell us anything!\u00a0 I tolerated the writing style because I wanted to know where it was going. In hindsight, I really disliked the book. It had its moments, that\u2019s it.\u00a0 The movie is actually better in my opinion. Also not perfect, but better and less of a waste of time.",

Maybe people consider drawn images of sexual scenes or nudity to be more scandalous for some reason, but it's ridiculous, a detailed sex scene in a book is much more \"pornographic\" than a tasteful drawing of a naked person. They really should include 18+ warnings with books too, especially bc some of them can be really disturbing",

So young adult was slowly created to fill a gap between the two. You should think of it as \"young adult\" instead of *young* adult. Early books in this genre were often morality books written in the 60s, often about boundaries and problem solving and building an ethical code. (I read a ton of books warning of being a fast girl when I was studying the history of YA) These days it's more about learning to be independent and still some sense of coming of age, building friendships, building a moral code and self-identity. Just before 2010 there was a shift in recognizing keeping the young in young adult so new adult was formed as a genre with a lot of those same things but targeting adults and talking gaining full independence, making choices for the future and sex. You'll see a lot of YA address sex but it's usually off page or fade to black (these are minors being portrayed typically after all) where New Adult is a wide range. Think of young adult as young people wanting to behave like adults and new adult as newly entered into adulthood.",

I have to wonder why we are so set on breaking everything up and categorizing it to death though? I mean I kind of get it, but also, when I grew out of \"kids\" books (Sweet Valley High and such o guess we're the closest thing to teen books I read?) I just started reading adult books that appeared to me, which was Stephen King, at like 11 lol. Why even the need for a \"new adult\" label? It's general fiction.",

Books with and about all sorts of topics are written in YA, from sex to drugs to violence and more. It is not an actual genre, either. For instance, \"characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter\" is criteria used in one (reasonable) definition of the term. YA varies greatly in all of these things.

The whole \"tiktok made me read it\" trend of teens reading \"spicy\" books where toxic relationships are sold as romantic really worries me. I'm all for kids reading what they want and very against banning everything that might allude to sex or has morraly dubious characters or even just doesn't fit the parents mindset. But leaving young girls alone with books that tell them that the behaviors of these book boyfriends are okay and should be expected or even celebrated in a relationship seems to just set them to have abusive relationships of their own",

Source: I worked in a bookstore. That being said, I did have a 10 year old girl come up (luckily with her dad) to buy It Ends With Us - a book very much in the adult section, but I personally think that maybe TikTok had more of an influence in her wanting to buy the book.",

After ding some reading I was pretty sure this genre was non-consensual spicey kink? Then editors started telling me they wanted a YA type voice, but with a high spice level, but in like basically any romance sub genre. And sometimes, the weirder the better? Then a whole bunch of people got confused and though new adult should come after young adult and before \"adult.\" So now it's just a total toss up what you are going to get when you buy a New Adult novel. Best to read a few sample pages before committing IMO.",

Cartoon covers used to indicate a lighter/comedic/less explicit book & now there\u2019s no way to tell-even the blurbs on the back are ambiguous. \u201cAm I going to get contemporary fiction w/a non hea, a cute rom-com with low/no sex scenes, or frequent & explicit on page sex?\u201d The fact that you can\u2019t tell from the cover or synopsis anymore is so frustrating. I\u2019m much less likely to take a chance on a book/author now & wait for reviews(mainly for the hea-smut/no smut not as important).",

Despite the main characters supposedly being 20, the way it's written makes them sound like mid-teens, with pretty much no emotional maturity to be found. It's also a relatively simple world/plot, and with only a single viewpoint character there's not much to follow. I've read plenty of \"YA\" that is more mature/complex. If you mean the explicit sex scenes, then sure. They didn't really do anything for me, but clearly it does for others, so if you want a starting point for those types of books then it could work. From what I remember it was rather vanilla in that aspect.",

I feel like people need to embrace not every book needing to be called a masterpiece to be fun and readable, and profitable. It is 100% ok to enjoy books like Fourth Wing, but let\u2019s stop pretending that they are anything more than ok when it comes to world building and writing. I personally love reading a Dan Brown novel. The writing is just ok, the plot is repetitive and formulaic, and Langdon is Mary Sue. I don\u2019t care about any of that, because every time I read one I have a jolly time. However, if someone asks, I will say that, not try to claim it is the best.",

The biggest issue I have with this however is that it\u2019s a randomly generated ability, based on your personality.

The alien is so, well, alien that the main character's perspective is utterly bizarre but that's the interesting thing. Makes it feel more cerebral to engage with the concept than any attempt at titillation. What I'm saying is, if Lindsay Ellis had tried at any point to actually make the alien seem 'hot' in any conventional sense at all, it would have been horrifically cringe. But she just didn't. Not one bit. And that's what I love about the books",

It's an intriguing concept that seems to have been completely missed by most. Who cares if it's a ghostwriter? It's just for fun.

It's accurate to the original mythology that everyone is a piece of trash. As for the Odysseus thing, yeah at first he's definitely written in a flattering light but that changes later on after Circe is separated from him. She realises how awful of a person he really was once their \"honeymoon phase\" is over, which I think is pretty accurate to a lot of relationships with not-great people.",

Miller centers the narrative on the women who are peripheral in stories of Greek heroes, and shows how damaging those encounters are. If you know anything of the original myths, she does a phenomenal job when it comes to accuracy. I think a lot of people hear \"feminist\" and go in expecting Circe to be a sassy girl boss version of Percy Jackson who's all about Womyn Power(tm). Then they're disappointed when she does all the things Circe does, instead of like, teaming up with Hera and booting Zeus out of Olympus or something.\u00a0",

But they were intended for a slightly older audience than Harry Potter, and I'd say they have more to \"dig into\" as an adult as they deal with a lot of ideas around Religion, Philosophy, Physics etc which are a bit more complex. The caveat is that you may struggle with the main character. She has a wonderful arc where she matures over the series, which is incredible to read if you're 12 years old and going through the same thing. However it means she starts off a bit of a brat and that may grate a bit to read as an adult. I also don't know how much you know about the series but the \"talking animals\" aspect isn't quite as straightforward as that and is actually a very interesting part of the world building once you get on board with it. If you give them a go please do come back and let me know if I've totally missed the mark!",

The issue I have is that the praise and popularity that it receives for that is wholly undeserved. The ideals the main character touts are archaic at best, several scenes positively frame sexual assault as something a woman can gain valor and experience from, the author kills their gays, etc etc. It wouldn't bug me so much *except* that it is marketed to an YA audience 12 -18. I just don't think that the younger ages in that range have what they need to contextualize how outdated and harmful some of these views are.",

Sure, they're on a whale hunt and all of that, but that's not what the book is about. The book is about one man and his descent into utter madness. It is an incredible read.",

New Adult is for like, late teens, early 20s, and can have actual sex scenes, like smut. Like Hunger Games is YA, but the latter ACOTAR and Throne of Glass books are New Adult. I think the name Young Adult came about from the idea that teens and pre-teens are smart and can handle tough topics, but that that doesn't mean that they need to be handed straight up adult novels with too overt of violence (Hunger Games is about the most violent I think YA books get) or sex scenes, and then NA seems to have come around to fill that gap where early adults are wanting to branch out beyond the novels they read as young teens, but aren't interested quite yet in getting into literature and the bigger Sci-Fi/Fantasy novels like ASoIaF and LotR and such. Like an in-between stage. But yeah, I do agree, the term Young Adult is a bit misleading. But idk what it would be called instead, without it being called like Teenage, pre-teens being not allowed to read them by parents, or people assuming it's about teen romance or something. And of course even tho the term New Adult exists, and is a place for actual smut to exist, they often still get marketed as Young Adult, which just muddies the water even more.

Well, except that I can see the dramedy b/c I remember a lot of black humor in the book. But, yeah, it's totally about complex family relationships. It made me think a lot. *Are* there people in my life, people I love, I would help cover up a murder? I feel similarly about Between Two Fires, which is a horror novel. It's also a great historical novel about the Black Death. But I will die on the hill that what it primarily is, is a non-romantic love story. The main character starts the book out as a Bad Man, a very angry, very very bitter person who's been betrayed by all the people he trusted the most, but who is redeemed (literally, lol) by learning to care for someone other than himself again. It's a lot deeper than just a scary-ass book with demons walking the earth.",

I don\u2019t want to discourage you from reading it, maybe you\u2019ll enjoy it more than I did, but what I would say is if after one or two hundred pages or so you\u2019re not enjoying it, I\u2019m fairly sure nothing that happens in the rest of the book will change your mind for the better. The tone is set from the first chapter and it really doesn\u2019t change throughout, so if you don\u2019t like the beginning you probably won\u2019t like the middle or the end either",

Nothing about the blurb or the comparison to Spinning Silver suggested there would be frequent and detailed depictions of severe body mutilation. Not only was it tonally extremely different to what is suggested by both of those, it also didn't bear that much resemblance to Spinning Silver, except the Eastern Europe inspiration. It was very offputing to be so taken off-guard by that. I do want to push back on some of your critique of Song of Achilles and it's marketing. First, I think you seem to take \"sexy\" as meaning \"explicitly sexual\". It doesn't, usually. Sexy is often a vibe, not a reference to specific content. I think a lot of people do find the book sexy - people who find masculine things very sexy, for instance. The book is very focused on things deemed masculine. It's also ultimately a romance, so I think it's maybe not the best marketing, but reasonay accurate.",

Idk though, I read the book, it\u2019s not super masculine either aside from the fact that the story is told from the perspective of a man. Most of the story\u2019s \u2018sexy\u2019 or \u2018sensual\u2019 things happen when they\u2019re horny teenagers, and those moments are deliberately a bit awkward to read.

The plot felt repetitive, the characters 1 dimensional - aside from maybe Dracula (literally, we\u2019re in her head for the entire book, and she doesn\u2019t have an ounce of personality), and the writing? The writing is possibly the best thing about the book, and even that feels like a very awkward attempt to be flowery and poetic at times.",

It pissed me off so much, because I\u2019m not American and many books I like and want to buy are hard to come by, I went to visit my American relatives in October last year, and it was one of the books that I was in my shopping list. I started reading the first chapter and I was so disappointed. I\u2019m also a gothic literature lecturer, so it pissed me off even more. I don\u2019t understand how it was so many good reviews floating around the internet",
