    "content": "I have a very unoriginal thing to say - Barbara Kingsolver is a genius. I have been sleeping on Kingsolver and am now almost 20 years late to her work but I am so glad to have found it. Her books are so engrossing and I feel transported in time and space.\n\nI read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days. Then someone on this subreddit recommend Poisonwood Bible as my next endeavor and I have finished that at a rate of knots too. I have Lacuna at home, collecting dust, and will go there immediately after my holiday.\n\nI just needed to share my love for this woman and her books, may she write many more!",

They\u2019re similar in that they\u2019re both from the perspective of children, but those voices are very different since their experiences are different. Poisonwood Bible is told from multiple perspectives, though, which I think gives it more depth. Both caught my attention right from the start, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth giving Poisonwood Bible a try since you should be able to tell early if it\u2019s something you\u2019ll enjoy and want to finish.",

While Kingsolver has a distinct voice and style, I love how she is able to immerse the reader in her characters' personas.

I think Poisonwood would be different enough that you should try it out even if you weren't grabbed by Demon.",
