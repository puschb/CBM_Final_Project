I have been sleeping on Kingsolver and am now almost 20 years late to her work but I am so glad to have found it. Her books are so engrossing and I feel transported in time and space.\n\nI read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days. Then someone on this subreddit recommend Poisonwood Bible as my next endeavor and I have finished that at a rate of knots too. I have Lacuna at home, collecting dust, and will go there immediately after my holiday.\n\nI just needed to share my love for this woman and her books, may she write many more!",

If you enjoy her writing, I heartily recommend you The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver, which I find even more engrossing than Demon Copperhead. I read it nearly as quickly and I was captivated for the whole book. It's a masterpiece which I couldn't put down. I'm eagerly starting The Lacuna now, and I hope she continues writing her magical stories for years to come.\"\n    \n    [User's other comments on the thread]:\n    \"Kingsolver is indeed a brilliant author, I thoroughly agree.

I feel like it's a good companion read for Kinsolver's works. \n    [User 2]: Oh no, I just bought it. I'll move it up in my reading list as soon as I have a bit more time.
