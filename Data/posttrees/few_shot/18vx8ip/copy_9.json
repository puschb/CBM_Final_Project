    "content": "I keep saying stories and posts about challenges like 52 books a year etc, and simply don't understand how people do it. With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

Use audio books while multitasking, such as during commutes or while doing chores.\n        3. Set a daily reading goal, even if it's just 15-30 minutes a day. Consistency is key.\n        4. Prioritize reading over other activities that aren't essential.\n        5. Don't stress if you don't meet your goal every day - it's okay to take breaks and come back to the book later.\n        6. Don't worry too much about retaining every detail - the main idea and overall plot should be enough.\n        7. Reading in multiple formats, such as print and audio, can help make the most of your time and keep things interesting.\n        8. Prioritize books you are really interested in or excited about",

I've found that some books are much easier to read than others, and so when I read something that isn't a page turner, it can take me a while to get through it. And audio books are definitely a game changer. I've listened to some books multiple times because I enjoyed the narration so much. And I second the recommendation for the Wax and Wayne books.

I tend to only listen to books that are at least 15-20 hours long because I want to get immersed in the story and really enjoy it.\n        20 hours is the average time for an audio book? I don't think that's accurate either. Some books are shorter and can be finished in a shorter amount of time, while others are longer and take more time to listen to. I would say it really depends on the book and the listener's personal preference.\n        15-20 hours is a more realistic estimate for the average audio book? Yes, I think that's a good estimate.

Space operas are definitely my jam too, and I agree with the previous comments about long, immersive stories with a lot of characters. Project Hail Mary, Leviathan Wakes, The Murderbot Diaries, and the Expanse series are all fantastic choices, and I'd also recommend the Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet series by Becky Chambers if you haven't read it yet. They're all around 10-12 hours, and are wonderfully written with great characters and compelling plots. If you like Murderbot, you might also enjoy the Interdependency series by John Scalzi, which is similar in style but has a different setting and cast of characters. Definitely check them out if you haven't already!",

The SecUnit in this particular series has hacked its own governors and refers to itself as \"Murderbot.\" Despite its name, the Murderbot has a strong moral code and doesn't like to harm humans.\n\n         The novellas in the series have been very well-received, with the first one, \"All Systems Red,\" winning the Nebula Award for Best Novella in 2017 and the Hugo Award for Best Series in 2018.

My husband and I have both been platinum audible subscribers for years, and we both go through 10-15 books a month on there between work and driving. As long as you don't have too much on your plate and can juggle it, you can definitely find time to read or listen to a book a week. It's important to find books that you enjoy, because it makes it much easier to keep up the pace of reading multiple books a week. And it's definitely helpful if the books you're reading are shorter, but if they're longer and you're really into them, it's not hard to power through. You can also try to listen to your audiobooks at higher speeds, but that depends on whether you can understand it well at those speeds and still find it enjoyable.",

This will give you a buffer for times when you might not have as much time to read.\n        2. Make reading a priority. Treat your reading time like any other appointment you have, and make sure to schedule it into your day.

These books tend to be written in a simpler style and may not require as much time or mental effort to digest. Additionally, some people find that listening to books as audio books can help them read faster and get through more material in a shorter amount of time. It's also important to prioritize reading and make it a regular habit, whether that means setting aside a specific time each day for reading or finding opportunities to read during otherwise idle moments. Finally, it's worth noting that being a \"fast reader\" is not necessarily the same as being able to retain or understand what you read. It's possible to read quickly and still miss important details or not fully comprehend the material.",

A lot depends on the book, but a good amount of popular books are written at a grade 7-8 level, and if I'm reading fast, I can consume a book in less than a day on average for most of the books I read. To make it even easier, take audiobooks into account! I listen to books while I'm at work, going for a walk, or relaxing at home, since I can listen to and follow along at the same time I'm doing other things.\n\n        Also, I'd agree that it's not a competition.

Prioritize reading. Make reading a priority in your schedule and treat it as an important task. Try to find time to read every day, even if it's just for a short period.\n3. Choose books that you enjoy and are interested in. Reading books that hold your interest will make it easier to stay engaged and motivated to finish them.\n4. Read continuously.

I think the key is to find a balance that works for you, whether that means dedicating a specific amount of time each day or week to reading, or setting aside larger blocks of time when you can really immerse yourself in a book. And as the previous commenter suggested, eliminating some of the time we spend mindlessly scrolling through social media or watching TV can help free up more time for reading.

It all comes down to making reading a priority and valuing it as an important activity.

But assuming the average book is more like a ~250 page book, it does take around 5 hours of time to read. If you factor in other commitments, then yes, reading a book a week is challenging. I think it would require making conscious choices about how you spend your time, such as limiting TV or time on social media, and making a goal to prioritize reading. Another strategy, as suggested in another comment, is to get audio books and listen to them while you're doing other things, such as commuting or cooking. I think retaining what you read depends on the individual - some people can retain a lot, while others struggle to remember much of what they read. I know personally, I have to take notes while I read to help me retain the information.",

It's not always possible to do that, especially if you're multitasking or have other things on your mind. But if you can set aside dedicated time to read (even if it's just an hour a day), you can easily read a book a week. Some people read faster than others, but if you keep in mind that it takes about 5-7 hours to read an average book, that's less than an hour a day. And if you're reading consistently, you'll find that the time flies by and you're left wanting to keep reading. It's just about making",

One strategy that has helped me is to set specific blocks of time each day for reading, and sticking to those blocks regardless of what else comes up. For example, if I set aside an hour after dinner each night, I make sure to read for that entire hour without distractions. Another tactic is to multi-task by listening to audiobooks",

I make it a habit of reading before I go to bed every night. I don't have time to watch 2 Netflix episodes a night, but I can make time for one chapter in a book. I've also found that I don't need to read every single word, and can skim and get the main idea. It's also helpful that I have a job where I get to read books for work, so that counts towards my total. I've read over 100 books this year so far.\n\n         While I don't think that many people can read a book a week, I do think it's possible to read a lot more than the average person if you make reading a regular habit and prioritize it.",

It's easy to find yourself scrolling through social media and forgetting that you even opened the Kindle app. One strategy that works for me is to make it a habit to have my Kindle open and easily accessible when I have free time. This way, instead of mindlessly scrolling through my phone, I can quickly open up my Kindle and start reading. Additionally, setting specific reading goals for yourself can help to keep you accountable and motivated. For example, try aiming to read for at least 30 minutes each day, or to finish a certain number of pages each day or week. And finally, try finding a book that really captures your attention, as this will make it easier to stay engaged and motivated to keep reading.\n\n         The comment you provided suggests that the user has already implemented the first strategy of keeping their Kindle app open and accessible.

Reading requires a more focused, active engagement with the text, whereas watching TV is more passive. Watching TV might be a more efficient way to spend your leisure time, but it might be less fulfilling or educational. If you switch from watching TV to reading, you might find that you not only increase your book consumption, but you also gain new knowledge, improve your critical thinking skills, and broaden your horizons. But it's ultimately up to you how you choose to spend your free time.\n\n         If you're committed to reading a book a week, the first step is to make a schedule and stick to it. This might mean setting aside a specific time each day for reading, such as an hour before bed, or dedicating a couple of hours on the weekend to reading. It can help to set a goal for how much you want to read each day",

I used to carry around physical books with me everywhere, but a Kindle has made it so much easier - especially when eating meals (I usually hold my Kindle in one hand, and use my other hand to eat - no need for both hands!). Plus, with a Kindle's backlight, you can even read in dimly lit environments, making it even more convenient.\n\n         Here are a few tips:\n\n        1. Set a goal: Whether it's a number of pages or minutes a day, having a goal in mind can help motivate you to read more consistently.\n\n        2. Find a book you enjoy: If you're not enjoying what you're reading, it can be harder to keep up the pace.

Firstly, prioritizing reading over other activities like watching TV or playing games can free up time for reading. Some people set aside specific time slots each day to read, such as during their commute or before bed. Using this time effectively, such as by choosing shorter books, can help increase your reading pace. Another strategy is to use audiobooks, which allow you to multitask while still getting through a book. However, some people find that listening to audiobooks requires more focus and they don't retain as much information. Finally, it's worth noting that everyone's reading speed is different, so what works for one person may not work for another. Some people can naturally read quickly, while others may need more time. It's also worth mentioning that it's not just about quantity",

As for speed reading, there are a few techniques you can try to get through books faster. One is skimming chapters or sections that aren't crucial to the plot, or that you're not particularly interested in. Another is focusing on the main ideas and arguments, rather than getting bogged down in every detail. There are also speed reading exercises you can practice, like increasing your reading speed gradually, or using techniques like chunking, where you group words together to read them more efficiently.

If a typical novel takes 15 hours to complete, then by this logic, a person could easily read 2 novels per week. If they read more quickly, they could read even more.\n\n         Note that in this scenario, we are assuming that reading does not require any extra time, and that the individual can somehow get through the entire 2 hours of Netflix content at once (or in a shorter timeframe so that the remaining time can be spent on reading). We are also ignoring other potential obstacles, such as the need for a quiet and comfortable place to read, the need to find engaging books to read, and the fact that some people may not find reading as enjoyable or engaging",

However, I don't believe it's necessary to read that quickly to enjoy a book and still consider yourself a dedicated reader. It's also important to note that reading speed can vary greatly from person to person, and what works well for one person might not work as well for another. I personally find it more beneficial to take my time while reading, absorb the information, and think about the characters and plot. Additionally, some books simply deserve to be read slowly in order to fully appreciate them. Lastly, it's crucial to remember that reading is a hobby and should be enjoyed, and not something that should be rushed or forced. Personal reading goals, whether they be reading one book a week or one book a month, should be realistic and achievable, and never at the expense of one's enjoyment or emotional well-being.",

As far as narrators go, I can't recommend Lauren Fortgang and Rebecca Soler enough. They have a wide range of voices and are so immersive in the stories they tell. I've listened to dozens of books narrated by them and they've never disappointed. If you're looking for something to listen to next, I'd say check out \"The Song of Achilles\" by Madeline Miller - it's a really stunning retelling of the Greek myth of Achilles and Patroclus. The story itself is captivating, but Soler's voice brings Patroclus to life in a way that I won't soon forget. Happy reading (or listening)!",

I enjoyed the lush descriptions of the circus and the complex relationship between Celia and Marco.\n\n         2. \"The Song of Achilles\" by Madeline Miller - This is a retelling of the Greek myth of the Trojan War, focusing on the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus.

As you've mentioned, romance novels, for example, are often easier to read quickly, whereas literary fiction usually requires a bit more concentration and contemplation. In my opinion, the key to reading a book a week is finding a balance between the type of book you're reading and the time you have available to dedicate to reading. For instance, if you're able to read for a couple of hours a day, you might want to choose shorter, easier books to get through quickly, while saving more demanding literature for when you have more time. Additionally, using different reading techniques, such as adjusting your speed, pausing to reflect and think, or breaking the book into smaller sections can also help make it more manageable.",

If you're not interested in the book, it will be harder to motivate yourself to read.\n        5. Use audiobooks: if you have a long commute or a lot of free time, consider listening to an audiobook. This can help you",

I, too, can blow through a 500 page romance in a day, but if it's something more complex like a literary novel, it might take me a couple of days.

The key is finding what works best for you personally and making the time to read every day, no matter how small. Maybe it's a few pages here and there during your commute, or a chapter over lunch.

Some people may have more free time and a faster reading speed, making it easier for them to complete a book in a week.

To achieve this goal, one may consider reading around 50 pages per day or even more, depending on your reading speed.

It's also important to note that reading habits and speed can vary from person to person, so what works for one individual may not work for another. As for retaining information, it's important to focus on understanding the main themes and ideas of the book, rather than trying to memorize every detail.\n\n         Additionally, it was noted in previous comments that reading speed may be a factor in how fast one can read a book.

It's easier to get lost in the story if you're reading longer chunks at a time. However, it can also help to break up longer books into smaller, more manageable sections. It's really a matter of personal preference and what works best for you.

A more attainable goal is to read 30-60 minutes a day, which puts you in the realm of reading a 300-600 page book in a week. Another approach is to get an audiobook and listen to it while commuting, exercising, or doing other activities.

The average speed for a skilled reader is around 200-300 words per minute, or about 30-45 pages per hour. That's assuming they're reading for comprehension, not speed-reading. If they're just speed-reading, then they can get through as many as 500 words per minute, or about 75 pages per hour. But even that seems quite laborious and not enjoyable in the slightest. Maybe they're including their work as part of their reading; it's entirely possible they can read at that pace if they're not processing the words, just skimming for important details. But on average, even very skilled readers only manage around 45 pages per hour. And to put in a whole 10,000 pages in one day, even if that's their only activity,",
