    "content": "I keep saying stories and posts about challenges like 52 books a year etc, and simply don't understand how people do it. With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

I really only listen to Sci-Fi and occasionally fantasy these days with some horror thrown in from King now and then. I used to be more evenly split between the two genres but over the past decade I've mostly stuck to Sci-Fi with a few exceptions like Sanderson, but I realized early on the kind of stories I like are the long Space / Fantasy opera with a lot of characters etc. although some more focused stories like Altered Carbon etc. work in too. It's not that I wont go lower than 10 hours, but takes something to make me consider using a credit. Shorter books area also a lot cheaper so sometimes I'll just pony up and buy low hour book if it's cheap enough and something I'm into to save the credit. Length is certainly a part of my equation too - bang for the buck. I get two credits a month, which comes out to two books so I like to go for long ones over short.. but again depends on the author and narrator.",

Usually when able I will listen to it alongside reading the book in English, which has shown me a few new interesting words/ways that native speakers say certain things. Then I usually go bug my sister in law when I'm confused about linguistic things that don't seem to translate well. Lol",

In order to get sufficient sleep, I have to be asleep by 10. In the space of 4 hours, I need to cook (and prep for next working day such as ironing clothes, lunch), I would listen to a podcast, watch a tv show. I\u2019ve already lost about 3 hours. I\u2019ve probably got forty-minutes-to-an-hour to read. That\u2019s 5 hours a week. Or 20 hours a month. For me, to complete perhaps 10-12 books a year is completely normal.

You can of course customise it \u201c, so reminders and calendar apps (or whatever you think is a must) are sent immediately whereas less priority apps like social media would be scheduled. This has been a game changer. I even disabled messages because nobody with an actual emergency will message me, they will call 911 or if it\u2019s me they need, they will call, so no need for my attention to be pulled all the time. In the end you need to change your attitude toward the phone. Use it as a tool, not a distraction. Notifications are a distraction so I disabled them. I use the phone when I need to, not when the phone (or someone else) wants me to. I\u2019d recommend reading Spark by Manoush Zomorodi as well as Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport.",

I'm also lazy so if I really need to I can put my phone in a different room (like upstairs) and get settled into my book downstairs. I'm much less likely to take a peak at my phone if I have to run up the stairs to get it.

The answer was basically nothing. Fun for some jokes and whatnot, but fills time and attention with no lasting benefit. I deleted Twitter, basically got off Facebook, and limit Instagram/Reddit to a couple checks per week. I moved all apps I kept to a folder to be less accessible and put the kindle app in prominent place. Then I made a list of books on goodread I wanted to complete which helped keep me focused on the value of reading (mix of fun, classics, religious, sociological) and got to it! Went from 28 books to 87, 101, 82, 90, 107. A huge boost in those numbers for me as well I audiobooks. I get up early to run and get 1.5 hrs audiobooks in or more almost every morning.",

I often put my book down just to check messages, even thought Ive left my phone inside. But it's too late, my mind is already on a tangent. Imo, just slowly reduce phone usage. - I'll take social media breaks and delete Reddit for a week or month. Or others. - I turn silent notifications on, or just turn them off completely; if I want to spend time replying to people, I'll specifically open my emails or message apps. - Start just by turning the phone off. When you pull it out, you'll catch yourself so many times checking it. It was a little sobering doing this when I was in \"reading mode\" or watching a movie. Seeing how bad it is first helped me realise I needed to work on it. - then I moved onto not having my phone on me physically when I was doing **anything** else. This worked the best for me reducing those impulses to check my phone. Watching tv? Leave the phone in another room. Using your phone while watching a show or movie is just as silly as using it while reading imo. Cooking, exercising, meeting someone, etc etc etc, leave the phone somewhere else. Focus on *insert any task here* at anytime. Phone time is phone time. Reading is reading time. Tv is tv time. Phone doesn't need to be on us 24/7. Few tips, hopefully they help. They worked for me. They aren't easy. They take time.",

That way i could get through books while walking my dog, doing crafts and making dinner, chores became something i just do while listening to my books. The next step was finding out what i like, that way i get invested in the stories and WANT to continue. My husband then gifted me a kindle and that kinda forced me back into physical reading. The stories became more imporant than doomscrolling tiktok. Now i read almost every genre, i love having a ebook/physical copy and an audiobook so i can max out my reading. I read so much when i was younger, but life came in the way and i had to learn myself to love it again. Now my screentime much lower, i sleep better and i love all the stories i get to be a part of.",

The next step was finding out what i like, that way i get invested in the stories and WANT to continue. My husband then gifted me a kindle and that kinda forced me back into physical reading. The stories became more imporant than doomscrolling tiktok. Now i read almost every genre, i love having a ebook/physical copy and an audiobook so i can max out my reading. I read so much when i was younger, but life came in the way and i had to learn myself to love it again. Now my screentime much lower, i sleep better and i love all the stories i get to be a part of.",

I now have to have text-to-speech helping me by letting me process with my ears rather than my eyes so that I have a fighting chance against people who don't have my difficulty. So I look at the words and have the audio text to speech help me when my visual processing fails me. With that, I've been able to read SO much faster. It's night and day. Some people just aren't good at reading with their eyes alone and need help and there's nothing wrong with that.

A beautiful, beautiful book that ripped my insides out. I feel good about recommending that book to anyone.",

I definitely notice a massive difference between my reading speed after barely touching a book for weeks, and my reading speed when I've been reading regularly for a few weeks. But the thing is, the effect isn't primarily due to practice. It's almost correlative. I only manage to read consistently for several weeks, if I am reading attentively. If I'm not, my mind is not in the game, and I will start slacking on tasks, getting distracted more, and quit reading, let alone reading several times a week. So I think what really makes me read faster is attentiveness. Mindfulness exercises, sports, having my tasks, chores, and hobbies in order. Those things give me the clarity of mind to read more quickly, because I'm less distracted, and more mentally present, allowing me to read individual pages faster and take fewer breaks - and they also happen to make me more likely to read more regularly.",

That said, if I'm reading something I'm not used to, or doesn't move as expected, I'll frequently find myself spacing out, and having to go back 3-5 times to reread because I've ready 3 out of 20 words and... Things just don't add up, so I must've missed something...? Also I tend To have shorthand for things. Names in particular, so if I'm reading something with lots of similarly named or the names look enough alike, I get confused easily because why the fuck is the author talking about Shiro's period when Shiro was a man three sentences ago?

I definitely don't read things \"out loud\" in my head, and also have that thing where I don't necessarily \"see\" things in my mind. So like, when I read a book, I don't do a lot of \"envisioning\" what/who/where things are happening. It doesn't trip me up very often. I don't do a lot of \"imagining/visualizing\" what has happened, nor do I mimic or even see facial expressions. \"Sarah looked at Adam with irritation\" Cool. Adam did something to piss Sarah off. I don't visualize the furrows in Sarah's eyebrows, or the fact that she looked at him and crossed her arms across her chest. Not only because I get the information directly from the statement \"with irritation, therefore she is irritated\" but also because I just don't \"see\" things in my head. Ask me to describe my husband, the man I've been married to for 14 years, and I'm like, \"uhhh. He's back, and bald. And about 6 feet.\" I just don't \"see\" him in my head. I also don't think about what I'd do in the situation, because that's not what I'm here for. I don't give a rats ass how I'd respond in that situation. Now... 90% of my reading is fantasy, so while it'd probably be cool to have a dragon that I'm bonded with, I know it's not a possibility, so why even put myself in that thought process? I'm here to read what the people in the story are doing with the situations at hand. I blaze through books pretty quickly. I'm also not saying that what you are doing is wrong, or what I am doing is right, as a disclaimer. Just find it incredibly interesting that with such different \"methods\" of reading, it's still enjoyable within those methods.",

Essentially saying the words aloud, but with their internal monologue. Then \"hearing\" them. Then interpreting them in order to then imagine the situation the words describe, then watching that imagination, only to finally reach an understanding. She was reading maybe 2000 words an hour tops. Probably more like 1500. Literally crying in dispare over our English lit class freshman year, she could not get through the book even with weeks to read like 90000 words. She'd sit there and legit read for 10 hours straight on a Saturday and get less than a 10th through the book. While I never even engage my inner monologue at all, and don't have the ability to create images in my head at all. Reading is a purely concept process. My eyes glide over the words and my brain processes the story directly into memories. Names are insantly translated to this \"basket of being\" for that character. No one has faces or clothes or bodies. I eat through hundreds of pages in a day.",

I'm not super beholden to it and sometimes it slows down on the weekends, but most weeks I read about 250-300 pages.

Taking out 8 hours for sleep and eating but nothing else, you'd have to read over 600 pages per hour. Realistically, you have at best 12 hours a day to read, which would mean over 800 pages an hour. The average person reads roughly 50 pages an hour. Reading comprehension starts to fall off a cliff for everyone around 160 pages an hour. Writing can vary, and it depends on what you're writing. But very generally, 1,000 words (roughly 3 pages) an hour is a decent pace. A fast typist types 100 words per minute or about 20 pages an hour. Taking out all creative aspects and just typing as fast as possible without thinking, 60 pages would take around 3 hours, even if you're an exceptionally fast typist. You're completely right that reading isn't a competition, which makes these claims odd.",

Reading skills are important, knowing which information is important, and which is not and/or repetitive, makes a big difference. I can skim the MAJORITY of the amount of work I process- it\u2019s repetitive in many cases- I\u2019ve already read it 100 times. Learning to hone reading skills early on gave me an easy advantage in life, which is unfortunate. I wish everyone had these abilities- but they don\u2019t, And most people (75%) washout before making it through training\u2026 and I\u2019m not even the fastest nor have the highest productivity!!! Which means\u2026 I\u2019m not the best. There\u2019s people out there better than me. So my point is, not everyone has the same ability to read and comprehend the same speed or amount of info. BECAUSE we\u2019re unique. Not everyone\u2019s brains were built the same. Not everyone had the same upbringing or the same amount of time. My grandma passed something onto me and my teachers, mentors, and family honed by abilities- I\u2019m forever grateful. Her son, my father, absolutely could not, if his life depended on it, read as either of us do/did. I couldn\u2019t read a Russian novel at the same speed, or complete an analysis of a complex mathematical theory (I flunked Calc II HARD), or compose a symphony. These are not my strong skills. That\u2019s okay. The percentages of what needs analysis and which can be skimmed is important, and I work 10-12 hour days. My typing speed is dependent on the work- but also on being able to quickly layout an individual template and essentially filling it in with the vital information. But typing and \u201creports\u201d or narratives are skills I worked in- for 25 + years. It\u2019s my job!! And wherever I stand, there\u2019s receptionists, transcriptionists, and bloggers who type faster than me I have no doubts. Honestly I\u2019m not the best at anything, and likely- either are you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s. Not. A competition. WTF cares with the exception of my CEO, direct sup., and my clients? Why would I ever bring it up in casual conversation? I wouldn\u2019t because no one cares. Shit most people don\u2019t even like to talk about my job much less the specifics. But never have I ever had someone in person be like- oh how many books have you read this year? How many pages can you read per minute of x, y, z subject? How many research articles did you make it through? How many words do you type a minute? Literally, never. NEVER. It\u2019s automatically a superiority based question. It\u2019s. Weird. Reading outside of work is supposed to be FUN. I read an enjoyable book at my inner narrative speed of choice- I can re-read books quickly, but I might choose to linger and savory a new juicy thriller. A balanced life is important for overall health. We all have different levels of ability And reading for enjoyment is what you make of it. Making it a social media competition is cringe- Give me a top three favorite reads. Give me a review that makes me itch to visit a locally owned bookstore. Tell why you think that book was so hard to digest. But I will not now nor ever give a shit how many books you read. And no one else does either. Rant over. Have a good one and accepting book recs",

You didn't say you skim through pages that you've already read 100 times. And it's in response to a thread about reading books, so the implication is that you can read 10,000 pages/day, not just skim some stuff for certain info you need. This bit of information is completely irrelevant and unnecessary in this context. Your combing through a bunch of pages you've already read in order to pick out certain info you need is not remotely close to reading a book. 2) Your \"particular set of skills\" is also irrelevant. I'm glad you trained for that. What you're doing is still not at all the same as reading a book, and so it has no place here. And your claim of superiority doesn't help anything. 3) You said 3,000-4,500 pages require analytical in-depth review. Even skimming through that many pages without the in-depth review would take a good 8+ hours just for that less than half of the total you mentioned. Adding in-depth review would mean going a whole lot slower. 4) You said you can write 60 pages a day in addition to all that \"reading\". I'm pointing out that even an exceptionally fast typist would take 3+ hours to type out 60 pages, and that's without any kind of thinking involved, just typing the words. I assume you're typing up manuscript pages or documents or reports that require thought and planning, which means it would take considerably more than 3 hours. 5) You gave this information completely unsolicited. Someone replied agreeing with your post, and you decided to offer this information for no reason at all. Which goes against your entire point. You ask \"Why would I ever bring it up in casual conversation?\". Well, you just did. This whole thread is you tooting your own horn, while trying to pretend you're not. 6) If you like to keep reading as something you do for pleasure, go for it. I'm not into making it a competition either (which is why I don't post about how fast I am at reading unsolicited). But if some people like to compare themselves against others, who really cares? For some people, the competition gives them the drive to do the thing.",

It took up literally ALL of my free time. Basically I decided I was more of a 30-Books-A-Year person, which left ample time for other hobbies and interests. If people love mowing through books and knocking things off their to-read list, then that's awesome!

Keep reading it.\" He got to the portion I reacted to about a minute later, looked at me again and was like, \"no way you got all the way to the bottom of that so quickly.\" This guy decided to test my reading speed vs his, so pulled up a flavor text information thing in his game, said start, and told me to tell him when I was done. He timed me, then read the same passage himself. I read it in like 24 seconds and he read it in like 2 minutes. We got into a bit of a conversation about it, a d I was like, \"bruh, I don't know what to tell you. I'm neurospicy and can't sed/hear things in my head, or I hear the wrong things and they repeat in my head over and over and over and over again so I try to avoid hearing things, which redirected me to reading.
