With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

Some people read e-books or audiobooks since they can listen to them while doing other things (working out, commuting, etc). Some people are just really fast readers and sacrifice sleep to read more.

The length of a book in audiobook form can also vary depending on the narrator's reading speed, so it's always a good idea to check the length before listening. I'd say it's possible to read/listen to a book a week by focusing on shorter novels, using audiobooks, and finding time to listen/read every day. Some people also find it helpful to set reading goals for themselves, such as a certain number of pages per day or per week. And while it's true that some popular books are long, there are also many short, enjoyable novels out there, so it's not necessary to only read the biggest books to find something to enjoy.",

I feel this is very common practise especially nowadays due to the rise of TikTok leading a lot of books to be simplified down to their tropes. A book I feel was marketed incorrectly is probably Song Of Achillies by Madeline Miller. I read the UK edition of this book, and on the cover the book is described as being \u2018dark\u2019 and \u2018sexy\u2019. After having read the book this is pretty disturbing given that the only sexual scenes take place when the characters are very young / underage (all others fade to black).

Ultimately, it depends on what you're looking for in terms of length, but many mysteries and lighter fantasy novels should fall within this range.",

Reading during commutes, breaks, or even right before sleep can also help. Prioritizing reading time and dedicating a specific amount of time each day, or setting a goal to read for a certain number of minutes per day, can also be helpful.\n\n         It also may not be about reading every word of the book. Some people skim or speed read, and some even listen rather than reading the actual book. You can retain most of the plot and main points of a book through skimming or speed-reading, and only spend more time on certain sections that are particularly interesting or important. However, if you're reading for the love of the written word and the enjoyment of the language and style, you may find it less satisfying to skim or listen rather than reading the book yourself",

In the book, Holding Up the Universe by Jennifer Niven, Libby Strout has a genetic condition called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease that effects the nervous system in her legs, but she is a celebrity at her school because of it. These two books, though written at different times, both center around protagonists who break the social norms of their time and deal with identity issues, but also share some differences. What are the similarities and differences in these two books?\n        User's comment history: ['I was 11 years old when I read",

Reading is an amazing hobby and a great way to pass time, but it's important to not lose sight of other important aspects of life, like spending time with family and friends, taking care of yourself, and experiencing new things.\n\n         I personally prioritize reading and make it a part of my routine, but it's not the only thing I do. I read for about an hour each day, and if I'm engrossed in a really good book, I'll definitely read more. But as you pointed out, there are only so many hours in the day, and other things have to take priority.\n\n         I also think it's important to choose books that are quick reads or can be listened to while doing other things, like commuting to work or cooking dinner. That way, you can still get in a good amount of reading without sacrificing too much time from other activities.\n\n         I'm glad",

In my opinion, there is no one \"right\" way to read a book a week, and it's important to find a method that works for you. Here are some tips that might help:\n\n         1. Choose shorter books or shorter series. The length of a book or series can greatly impact how long it takes to finish. If you're trying to read a lot in a short amount of time, opt for shorter books or series with fewer instalments.\n\n         2. Listen to audiobooks. Listening to audiobooks can help you squeeze in reading during otherwise idle moments, such as commuting to work or going for a walk.\n\n         3. Set aside dedicated reading time.

It's all about finding what works best for the individual and making it a priority.",

The books I choose tend to be pretty long and complex, so it does take more time than average to finish them. For me, I find that I can read a lot when I have a consistent routine. I carve out specific time in the morning before work, during my lunch break, and before bed to read. And, I generally don't watch TV or movies during the week, so that helps. I also don't listen to music while I'm reading, as I find it distracting. With all that said, I'd be curious to hear how others find the time to read so much!",

Watching significantly less TV and replacing phone scrolling time with reading.\n\n        You can also set a goal to read for a certain amount of time every day, such as 30 minutes or an hour. Consistency is key!\n        Another suggestion is to focus on reading shorter books or books with smaller page counts. They can be just as fulfilling and satisfying as longer books!\n        Also, using audiobooks can be a great way to make the most of your time while commuting, exercising, or even doing household chores!\n        Ultimately, it's all about making reading",

Make reading a daily habit. Set aside a specific time each day to read, even if it's just 15-30 minutes. Consistency is key.\n2. Cut down on time-wasting activities. This might mean cutting back on TV shows, social media, or other hobbies.\n3. Prioritize books that are easy to read. If a book is difficult to understand or not interesting to you, it's going to take longer to get through.\n4. Consider reading shorter books. A shorter book will take less time to read than a longer one.\n5. Listen to audio books on long commutes or workouts. Audible is a popular platform for audio books, and you can find many of the latest releases there.",

One such method is reading a book while eating a meal. Just as gamblers invented the sandwich to keep their hands free for card games, I have adapted this technique to my own needs by using a Kindle and balancing the plate against my chest. This allows me to turn pages with my thumb while still maintaining the ability to eat and use utensils with my dominant hand. I have also found a cutting board to be helpful as a temporary \"mini table\" when eating meals without a table nearby. This allows me to read while eating even in a variety of settings and positions.\n         Here are some tips if you want to give this multitasking technique a try:\n         1. Start by familiarizing yourself with your preferred reading device or app. Make sure you are comfortable with the settings and the method for turning pages.\n         2.",

You could also try finding a comfortable spot where you can read without needing to balance a book, such as on a couch or in a comfortable armchair.

It's not always easy or convenient, but it's a good way to unwind and get lost in a story without sacrificing too much time. And honestly, sometimes I don't even retain everything I read, but I enjoy the experience of discovering new worlds and characters.

Reading can also serve a similar purpose, but it can be more cognitively demanding and some people might find it harder to settle into. Additionally, the time spent watching a show goes by much quicker as there's less mental effort required. Switching that time for reading might not be as straightforward as it seems and could lead to frustration or burnout.\n\n         Ultimately, it's important to find a balance that works for each individual.

So it's important to find a pace that works for you and not compare yourself to others.\n\n         It might also be helpful to seek out shorter books, audiobooks, or multi-narrative books where different perspectives are included, to make the most of your reading time.\n\n         Good luck with reading a book a week, and I hope you find great books that captivate your attention!",

If you can find time to watch 2 episodes of Netflix a night (assuming each episode is approximately 45 minutes long), then you have around 90 minutes of free time a night. Assuming a book takes on average around 19 hours to read, that's around 5 books per month. Multiply that by 12 months, and you get 60 books per year - the challenge referred to in the original post. If you can find a way to condense or cut out the 2 hours of Netflix a night, or find other small pockets of free time throughout the day, you can easily squeeze in more reading and reach the 52 books a year goal.

However, it is important to note that retaining information from books can be difficult, as reading is a passive activity, and the mind may not absorb information as well as it would during more active pursuits.\n\n        *Note: The user may not have the same opinion as the example response provided, but this is a possible response for them based on their comment history.*",

Is that like a super power or what?\n\n         For those keeping track, here's my list of comments since my last response:\n        - No, but I don't think it's healthy for people to feel that they need to always get rid of physical items, especially books that others may enjoy and still be in great condition. I've been told that some charity centers throw away books if they don't sell, which I think is terrible.\n        - I'd be happy to let you know but this is not a sub for discussing romance books.\n        - Goodreads is fine for keeping track of books, but I find it very limiting. I much prefer Storygraph as it uses algorithms to not only keep track of what you've read but also suggest books based on your interests and what you've read.\n        - Some of my favorite books in the ACOTAR series",

If you're jumping around and missing details, you'll have a hard time keeping track of the story. One trick I've found helpful is to skim the first and last sentence of each paragraph to get a sense of the main ideas. Then, if something doesn't seem to make sense, you can go back and read more carefully. Also, if there are repetitive or difficult names, try making shorthand for them in your head. That way, you can quickly identify them when they come up again without having to slow down and read the full name. Good luck on your reading challenge!",

Reading short books or using audio books can help, as can setting specific reading goals and finding ways to fit reading into your daily routine.

If you find yourself getting bored and struggling to read, it might be time to take a break or choose a different book. But if you're engrossed in the story, you'll likely find that you can easily surpass 50 pages a day and read even more. Additionally, it's important to find a reading routine that works for you. For example, some people read best in the morning, while others find it easier to concentrate at night. Choosing a consistent time to read each day and making it a schedule can help make reading a book a week a reality.\n\n         For instance, the following:\n        The post's title: Books about war\n        The post's content: I'm trying to get into more nonfiction books about war, specifically in Africa.

If you're just speed reading through a book to tick off a box, you'll miss all the subtleties and nuances that make a book truly special. My advice would be to set aside a dedicated time each day to read, and try to read at a steady pace that allows you to fully appreciate the book. You may not finish a book a week, but you'll certainly enjoy it more.\n\n         In terms of finding the time, you can definitely make reading a priority.

I also listen to audiobooks on long car rides or while I'm working out, which helps me get through books faster. And, as you mentioned, finding the right balance between reading and other activities like exercise or watching TV can help make time for reading, too. I don't think it's a bad thing to lose weight while reading, but if that's not your goal then finding ways to move while reading can still be a good solution for getting through books more quickly.

However, setting personal goals can be a motivating factor in one's reading journey. While it's not healthy to make reading a competitive activity, it's also not unhealthy to set reasonable targets and strive towards reaching them. The key is to find a balance and not let reading become an all-consuming obsession. As for how to read a book a week, some strategies can include:\n\n        1. Reading multiple books at once - this allows you to pick up a book when you have a spare moment, even if it's just for a few minutes.\n        2. Audio books - listening to a book while driving, commuting, or during chores can be a great way to get through a book more quickly.\n        3. Choosing books that are a bit shorter in length, or quicker reads in general",
