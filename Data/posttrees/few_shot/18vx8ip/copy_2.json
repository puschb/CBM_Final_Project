With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

Make time for reading by setting aside a specific time each day to read (e.g. first thing in the morning, during your lunch break, right before bed), and stick to it as much as possible.\n        3. Learn to speed read, or practice skimming to quickly gain a general understanding of the book without having to read every single word.\n        4. Listen to audiobooks while doing other tasks, like commuting, cooking, or cleaning.\n        5. Don't be afraid to give up on a book if it's not grabbing your attention and move on to something else that does.\n        6. Read multiple books at once, so if one is slow, you can always switch to another.",

I'd say shoot for books that are 6 hours or less, and make sure to listen to them at 1.5x speed. That way you can get through a book in about 4 hours. And if it's a really good book, you can always slow down to listen more carefully. I also find that listening to books while doing other things (like exercise, chores, commuting, etc.) helps me speed through them faster. And as for retaining what you read, it depends on the book. Some books are just for fun and you don't need to remember everything. Others require more focus and you might have to go back and reread certain parts. But overall, as long as you're enjoying the book and not just rushing through it, you'll retain the important parts.",

In fact, some of the shortest books can be some of the most rewarding. Agatha Christie's novels, for example, are usually quite short and can be read in a single sitting if you have the time. As for Discworld, each book tends to be around the 400-500 page mark, so not too long either. If you're looking for shorter books to get through quickly, I would definitely recommend giving those a try. And as for narrators, John Lee is definitely a great choice - his narration of Peter F. Hamilton's books is fantastic. But there are plenty of other great narrators out there as well, so don't feel limited to just the ones I mentioned. And don't forget about physical books too - sometimes it's easier",

I think the key to reading faster is to find books that you really enjoy and are invested in the story and characters. If you're bored or indifferent to a book, you're going to read it much slower. I also try to prioritize reading over other activities and make it a regular part of my routine, like reading before bed or during my lunch break.\n        2. I don't think the length of the book necessarily matters as much as the level of enjoyment and engagement you get from it. Some shorter books can be very engaging and fly by, while some longer books can be a struggle to get through.

Choosing ebooks or audio books, which can often be listened to faster than reading aloud, can also be a good strategy.\n\n         Additionally, setting aside dedicated reading time each day, even if that's only 30 minutes, and trying to minimize distractions, can make a big difference in your rate of progress. Some people also find it helpful to set a specific goal for the number of pages they want to read each day, rather than trying to read for a set amount of time.\n\n         Lastly, reading may be easier when it's something you truly enjoy and look",

With a busy schedule, carving out time to read can definitely be a challenge, but I believe it's all about finding what works best for you. For some people, reading on their commute or during lunch breaks might work, while others might prefer to listen to audiobooks or read during a specific time of day, like before bed. It's also important to prioritize what you want to read, and not feel pressure to finish every book that catches your eye. And, as noted, there's nothing wrong with setting a goal for a certain number of books per year, as long as it doesn't become too stressful or take away from other important aspects of life. Ultimately, it's all about finding a balance that works for you and not feeling the need to compare yourself to others.",

Pick the right books: While a 500 page doorstopper doesn't have to be avoided at all times, it may be helpful to find books that can be read quickly, but still offer a great story. Thrillers, mysteries, or other fast-paced adventure novels can be good choices.\n        2. Make reading a habit: Just like brushing your teeth or going to bed at a certain time, designate a specific time (or multiple times) to read each day. By making reading a habit, it becomes easier to stick to the schedule.\n        3. Read during non-commuting hours: Leverage your available time by reading on public transit, or while waiting for appointments.\n        4. Eliminate distractions: Turn off your phone or put it away to avoid notifications and minimize distractions. Find a quiet and comfortable reading spot.\n        5. Listen to audiob",

They\u2019re essentially thin weights that you can attach to the corner of a page to keep it open. I\u2019ve heard of them but haven\u2019t personally used one. Another option is to use a bookmark with magnets on the end that stick to the book itself. Or you can try using a regular bookmark with a paperclip to hold the pages open. I\u2019ve also seen people use small, lightweight stones or rocks as bookmarks, but be careful not to tear the book if the rock is too heavy or rough! There are also other options like these I\u2019ve read about but I haven\u2019t actually used myself. Good luck with your reading challenge!",

The good thing is, you can always re-read books if needed to refresh any details or meanings you may have missed before.\n\n            For instance, the following:\n            The post's title: Looking for a fantasy book recommendation!\n            The post's content: I'm not really looking for any specific genre (though I'd prefer it's a series), just need a fantasy series that is character-driven",

However, there are a few ways to increase your reading speed and make time for more reading:\n\n        1. Prioritizing reading: Make reading a priority and set aside dedicated time each day to read, even if it's just 10-15 minutes.\n        2. Listening to audio books: Audio books can help people read faster than they would if they were reading physically, as it eliminates the need to read each word individually.\n        3. Reading multiple books at once: Some people like to read multiple books at the same time, such as a physical book and an audio book. This allows you to always have something to read, even when you don't haveaccess to a physical book.\n        4. Choosing shorter books: Shorter books can be more manageable for busy people, and can be read in fewer sittings.",

For example, if you set aside 30 minutes each day to read, that adds up to 6.5 hours a week. And if you're reading a longer book, you can always switch to a shorter one in between. Also, try to find books you really enjoy, as that will make it easier to stay engaged and keep reading. Good luck on your reading challenge!\n\n         Another suggestion is to choose books that are easier to read, such as action-packed thrillers or light romances. These types of books tend to be more plot-driven and not as heavy on the language, which can make them faster to get through.

Another option to consider is breaking the book up into smaller reading sessions. By scheduling shorter, more frequent reading sessions, you can fit more reading into your day without having to sacrifice large chunks of time.

Some people naturally read faster than others, and the type of book you're reading can also impact this. For example, I can get through a light, easy read in a day, but a more complex book with lots of names and details to keep track of might take me a few days to plow through. It really varies!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t---\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn response to the original post, here's some general tips for increasing your reading speed:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. **Speed reading technique:** This involves training your eyes to move faster over the page, skipping spaces between words. It's not for everyone and can take some practice, but it can definitely help increase your reading speed.",

Reading in multiple shorter sessions throughout the day can also help with retention and make it feel less daunting. I personally find that setting goals for myself and tracking my progress helps me stay motivated. Good luck and happy reading!",

I don't have that luxury and am content with my pace of 2-3 books per month. To be honest, I don't think it's a great idea to try to read so quickly, especially if you're not naturally a fast reader. You can definitely increase your reading speed, but not at the expense of really enjoying the book and retaining the information. I try to read at least an hour a day, which fits in nicely with my exercise routine. I find that a combination of walking and reading works really well for me. It's a great way to multitask and get some steps in while still being able to enjoy a good book.",
