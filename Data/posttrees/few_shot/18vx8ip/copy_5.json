With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

I don't have specific numbers for audio length, but a quick search online suggests that \"Small Gods,\" for example, is around 7-8 hours long in audio form.

Audio books are very useful for people who like reading fiction but have a busy schedule, as listeners can consume books while doing other activities, like commuting, exercising, or doing chores. Since audio books tend to be a time-saver for many people, they can increase the speed at which listeners consume stories, especially if the listener is a speed reader. However, some listeners may not retain as much information from the story compared to reading it with their eyes, depending on their level of engagement during the listening experience.\n        2. Many readers choose to read short books to save time and make it easier to consume multiple books within a short timeframe. Reading short books can also make it more manageable to read multiple genres or keep up with a book club or reading challenge.\n        3. Some readers may find that reading multiple books within a shared universe or series makes it easier to dive into a story and remember important details from previous installments in the series.",

A good narrator can really make the experience enjoyable, and they often get through books at a faster pace than reading them yourself. I've been an Audible Platinum subscriber since 2003, so I've used this method for a long time.\n        * Don't focus on the length of the book. Some shorter books can be just as rewarding as longer ones, and they're often cheaper too.\n        * Find narrators you like, and choose books based on their performances. Some narrators really elevate the material they're reading, while others can ruin a book.\n        * Don't worry about retaining every detail. You can always go back and reread parts of the book if you need to, or just enjoy the story for what it is.\n        * Listen while commuting, driving, or doing other tasks that don't require your full",

I've read several of those and completely agree about the internal conflict. Personally, I think the character is hilarious and the series is a great example of a successful first-person singular protagonist.\n\n         If you enjoy it, I'd highly recommend checking out Martha Wells' other works. I'm currently listening to The Timeship Series, which is also narrated by Mur Lafferty and is quite entertaining. It's another example of a long series, but like Murderbot it has a strong narrative voice and doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\n         I should also mention that I'm an Audible Platinum subscriber as well and use it to listen to many books while I'm commuting or doing chores around the house. It's a great way to get through long books and discover new authors/series.\n\n         Hope that helps!",

Reading speed and comprehension doesn't work like that. It's a skill that takes time, practice, and a genuine love for reading. It's not just about the genre you read, but also understanding the story, engaging with the characters, and fully immersing yourself in the world the author has created. So, if you're looking to read a book a week, it's best to start with books that are more accessible to you, something you feel you can connect with. And yes, children's books can be great for that, but don't think reading just children's books will automatically make you a speed reader! It takes a lot more than that! \u0ca0\\_\u0ca0",

Some people remember details while others remember the overall message. Reading is subjective, and it's okay to read for enjoyment without retaining every detail.\n\n         Lastly, reading speed and comprehension vary greatly from person to person. Some people have a natural aptitude for reading quickly and understanding complex texts, while others may need more time and practice. Overall, there are many factors that contribute to a person's ability to read a book a week, and everyone's approach will be unique",

For me, I've found that by making reading a regular part of my daily routine, it becomes easier to fit into my schedule. I usually try to read for a set amount of time each day, like 30 minutes to an hour, regardless of what else I have going on. If I can't sit down to read physically, I\u2019ll listen to an audiobook while I\u2019m doing other things like cooking, exercising, or commuting. And as someone else mentioned in this thread, multi-tasking can help increase the amount of reading you get done.\n\n         It's also beneficial to find books that hold your interest and keep you engaged so you don't feel like you're wasting your time. If you enjoy what you're reading, it's easier to make the time to do it.",

Choose the Right Books: If you're new to reading a lot, start with shorter books or faster-paced genres like crime, mystery, or romance.\n         3. Read Everywhere: Take advantage of opportunities to read outside of your regular reading time, such as commuting to work, waiting in line, or even waiting for a friend to arrive.\n         4.

To read a book a week, you need to be very organized and committed to setting aside time for reading consistently. One tip is to turn off notifications so it won't bother you and set a timer for a certain amount of time each day. Start with a shorter amount of time, like 20 minutes, and read without stopping or checking your phone until the timer goes off. Gradually increase the time or do multiple sessions until it's not a problem. It can also help to find books that you genuinely enjoy and look forward to reading. Sometimes, audio books can also be a good option for those who have long commutes or have difficulty focusing when reading physically. As forretaining what you read, it depends on the individual's learning style and how engaged they are with the material.

Additionally, many people might prefer to read longer, more complex books and finding the time to read them can still be a challenge. It's also worth considering that the average book takes longer than 15-20 hours to read, as some literature can be dense and require more time to fully understand and appreciate. Finally, some people might prefer to listen to audiobooks, which can be consumed while doing other activities, making them a more efficient use of time.\n\n        In any case, finding the time to read is ultimately a matter of prioritizing reading and making a conscious effort to make reading a regular part of one's daily routine.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on the book, and also your own favourite book of all time.\n         User's comment history: ['Not even close, but I'll admit I'm a sucker for sci-fi so anything Douglas Adams or Isaac Asimov would feature highly on my list.', '",

You can use anything as a bookmark, but a heavy book is a great choice if you're looking for a more stable method.

For some, summarizing what they've read at the end of each day can help with retention. Others might find listening to audiobooks more helpful to retain the information. Ultimately, it's all about finding what works best for the individual.",

Watching a Netflix show takes a few minutes to find the show, navigate to the episode, click play, and wait for it to load. Reading a book requires a level of attention and mental energy that watching a show doesn't. You can't multitask while reading like you can while watching a show. Also, everyone's reading speed depends on their comprehension skills, so someone who reads faster may finish a book more quickly than someone who reads slower. And not to mention the difference in the amount of content between a book and a 2-episode arc on Netflix, which will vary greatly.

First, make sure you're reading physical books instead of e-books. Physical books are easier to read quickly because you're not being distracted by clicking the next page, and you're less prone to getting stuck on hard words. This is because of something called the \"Matthew Effect\" - the more you read, the more you know, and the easier it is to understand new words.\n\n         Second, you can try speed reading techniques. One common technique is to read using a metronome to force yourself to read faster. It takes a while to get used to it, but it can increase your reading speed significantly.

It's important to remember that not everyone's method for reading a book is the same, and there's no right or wrong way \u2013 so long as you're enjoying the experience!\n         For choosing audiobooks, I recommend finding one with a good narrator whose voice you enjoy listening to. This can help increase your overall enjoyment of the book and make it easier to follow along. You mentioned you have favorite narrators now, which means you've likely found some that work well for you \u2013 keep those in mind for future audiobook selections!\n         If you'd like to start incorporating more traditional reading into your schedule",

To respond to \"How to read a book a week?\", I'd say the key is to treat it as a daily routine, similar to exercise or meal prep. Setting a consistent goal, such as 50 pages a day, makes it easier to build the habit and keeps it from feeling like a chore. Reading for a certain amount of time each day instead of a number of pages can also be effective, as it eliminates the need for page counting and allows for more flexibility based on the book's length.\n        2.

Michael Kramer and Kate Reading - They are a husband-and-wife duo who are known for their outstanding narration of fantasy and science fiction books.

Some people can breeze through a 350-page book in just a few days, while others might take a little longer. It's also worth considering that a 350-page book might not be the average length for everyone. Some books can be much longer, and others might be shorter. So, it's important to find a consistent pace that works for the reader, and to be flexible with it depending on the size and complexity of the book at hand. Reading 50 pages a day is a good starting point, but some people might need to read more or less depending on their preferences and schedules.",

I find it difficult to dedicate whole days to just reading when there's a full life to be lived, hence why I read at a pace of around 20 to 40 pages per hour depending on the difficulty, genre, and my current level of absorption.

In terms of reading speed, practice doesn't really help. 200 wpm is average, but the standard deviation is huge. Some people may read an entire book in a day and others might take a month. If you're really interested in reading a book a week, and you know you're an average to below-average reader, you might want to consider audio books. Those are typically much faster to consume, and you can easily listen to more than the average person can read. However, you should be aware that audio books have a few drawbacks (most notably the cost) and you have to commit to actively listening to them. Lastly, some books have more to retain than others. Fiction or non-fiction might be best for this exercise since those are designed to be consumed, but some more academic works might force you to read slower and really learn the material. Hope",

It's also worth noting that this can be affected by the book itself and your own habits. For example, if you tend to read in the evenings before you go to bed, starting a new book every night and keeping it up will help you keep track of the story much more easily than reading a few pages here and there throughout the day.

Reading speed is personal. Some people can read faster, some slower. Some people like to focus on every little detail, some prefer to skim. There are many factors that influence reading speed.

It's also nice to have a dedicated time for reading and not have to worry about screens late at night.\n\n         That being said, reading pace definitely depends on the writing style.

I'm also curious, does anyone else here do this, or have any other suggestions for combining exercise with reading?",

If the book is interesting/well written then I'm sure you can get through it in your preferred situation of being curled up. For me, audiobooks are a way for me to get through things I might not pick up otherwise, due to time constraints.

Some people have found ways to fit in reading a book a week, either by reading for long periods of time each day, reading quickly, listening to audio books, or both.

Walking around the room while reading is one option, though physical books can make this more difficult. It's definitely worth giving it a try if it's something you think you might enjoy.

You're totally right reading isn't a competition, but it's still impressive and inspiring to hear about other people's reading habits and challenges.

But it's important to remember that everyone's reading ability and speed is unique, and the main goal should be to enjoy the books we choose to read.\n\n         To provide additional context for the other",

Listening to audiobooks can allow people to multitask and increase their reading speed. This can also help people who struggle with reading to still enjoy books.\n        3. Books often take a lot more time to read than expected due to factors like interruptions, getting lost in the story, or rereading parts.

This can be a good strategy if you prefer shorter books or you find them easier to read. Many classics, for example, are relatively short.\n\n         2. Listen to audiobooks. Listening to an audiobook while multitasking can be a good way to speed up your reading. This can be especially helpful if you find it difficult to focus on reading.\n\n         3. Set aside dedicated reading time each day. Depending on the length of the book, you may be able to set aside 30 minutes to an hour each day for reading. This way, you read a little bit every day, and you're more likely to stick to the habit.\n\n         4. Speed read. Speed reading is a technique for reading faster than normal. It can be helpful",

If the reader has a good flow and can read a sub-minute per page, then the book can be finished in under 10 hours. However, a more reasonable average would be 90 seconds per page, which brings the reading time down to just over 10 hours for a 400-page book. It's important to find a comfortable pace and not rush through the book. For some people, listening to an audio book can help increase their reading speed, as they are able to multitask and don't have to physically turn the pages. Ultimately, it's all about finding what works best for you and taking the time to enjoy the book.",
