    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

The story itself is a lot of quiet despair, hushed waiting for things to happen that never happen, and the exposition of the inner life of intellectuals and government civil servants. To make that into a truly beautiful, heartbreakingly dark and deep movie was an absolutely amazing thing to see. The second for me is the Emma Thompson adaptation of Sense and Sensibility. No other movie-length adaptation of Austen gets every single note just resonantly perfect. The dialogue, the careful trimming down that retains the heart and the flow of the story... It's brilliant.",

About midway through the movie I was like \"Did they forget what the movie was about? The invaders are just doing random stuff for no apparent reason.\" Also as someone who grew up in \"upstate\" NY, I found it deeply problematic how the New Yorkers just moved up and it was suddenly all empty of people.

            "comment_text": "I have two: 1) Possession by AS Byatt. One of the most breathtakingly brilliant novels made into one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is driven in large part by the male protagonist being a hopelessly introverted, very British, painfully reserved failure of a scholar. He has a complex and deeply intellectual inner life. His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. 2) The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper. This has a similar problem. The plot is a beautiful and complex quest narrative that is grounded in ancient Celtic lore, and deeply rooted in a sense of place. In fact, the specific locations in the book are kind of these sacred spaces that persist through time and have meaning in part because of where they are in the world. The first book is set in Buckinghamshire. Somehow they thought that making a movie out of this book and setting it in southern California. Nothing in the movie makes any sense. It's truly terrible.",

They totally missed the point of the book, in my opinion, totally glossed over some of the best character building bits, turned some wholesome characters into utter bastards... The only thing that remains from the original story is the fact that you have an American girl and a French boy who go to Venice together. The way they meet, why and how they connect, how their love story develops, why they decide to go to Venice, how they manage to go... All of that is different. The sequel, *Pythagore, je t'adore* is also one hell of a ride. I don't think the books were translated from French to English, but please, do NOT watch *A little romance* (and if you have, don't judge a book by its movie).",
