My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

The Help by Kathryn Stockett - the movie stayed pretty true to the book, but the casting of Emma Stone as a black character was problematic and took away from the overall message of the book.

Despite the main characters supposedly being 20, the way it's written makes them sound like mid-teens, with pretty much no emotional maturity to be found.

I've read all the books in the Inheritance Cycle (plus Brisingr, The Ellesmera Experiment, and The Inheritance Alphabet) and I think they're fantastic, but the movie was almost comically bad. I think the actor who played Eragon was completely miscast. He didn't have the right look, the right energy, or the right voice. The special effects were also terrible, especially for a movie that was released in 2006. I think the directors were trying to make the movie more action-oriented than the books, but that didn't work either. The book is really about the relationships between the characters, and the movie barely touches on those. I've tried to watch it again a few times but I can't get through it.\n        For what it's worth, I thought the sequel to the movie (The Eldest Chron",

However, if you're particularly invested in the source material, I can see how the movie might disappoint. As for the best way to experience it, that's up to you. You could read the book for the first time or see if the movie can stand on its own. Either way, you're in for a fun adventure. Good luck!\n         It's definitely worth picking up the book if you're interested in fantasy novels. I'd say it's more than just a kids' book, with complex themes and well-developed characters.

However, I have read both Eragon and The Lord of the Rings, and there is no comparison. Eragon may be enjoyable for a young adult audience, but it lacks the depth, complexity, and richness of language that Tolkien brings to his work. It's not just that Tolkien spent more time on his work (although he certainly did), it's that the quality of the writing is just on a completely different level.\n\t* That being said, I do think that Eragon is worth reading if you enjoy young adult fantasy. It's just not in the same league as The Lord of the Rings.\n\t* And as for your point about the Inklings, I find it fascinating how much they contributed to Tolkien's work. It's a testament to the power of community and collaboration in creating great literature",

The book is a captivating, thought-provoking tale of a young girl's journey through a complex and imagined world, whereas the movie falls far short of capturing that magic. In the book, Lyra's character is richly-drawn, intelligent and brave, whereas in the movie she seems bland and boring. The supporting characters in the movie, such as Mrs. Coulter, lack the depth and complexity found in the book. Additionally, the scenes in which Lyra undergoes daemon-switching are completely absent from the movie. This is a crucial aspect of the book's plot, as it shows the intimate relationship between a person and their daemon. In short, the adaptation of The Golden Compass fails to capture the magic and complexity of Pullman's original work, and I would strongly recommend reading",

I've read the book a few times, but I enjoy rewatching the movie on a regular basis.\n\n         For a book that didn't translate well on screen, I'd say something like The Martian. I thought the movie was great, but I felt like it lacked the same wry humor and satire that's in the book. The characters in the movie felt much more two-dimensional than they did in the book, and it didn't have the same sense of humor it had in printed form.\n\n         Additionally, I think the ending of the movie is much more satisfying than the book",

While the film remains popular, it deviates from the novel in numerous ways, changing key aspects of the characters and events to fit the romanticized vision that Hollywood often has. I believe Jane Austen's original work is still the best version of the story, as it offers a more realistic and nuanced portrayal of the characters.\n\n         Another great choice would be The Shining by Stephen King, with an adaptation that deviated significantly from the source material and missed the mark in terms of tone, themes, and character development.

The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my all-time favorite books and I've read countless adaptations of it, but none have managed to capture the essence of the original story. The revenge story is such an important part of the narrative and it's always disappointing to see it diluted or even completely changed in the movies.\n\n         In my opinion, the best adaptation of the book is still the 1934 version starring Louis Hayward as Edmond Dant\u00e8s, but even that doesn't fully capture the brilliance of the novel. It's a tough task to translate such a complex and lengthy story into a film, but it's definitely worth a try.\n\n         It's always interesting to see how different writers and directors approach the same source material. Sometimes they manage to add something new and interesting, but more often than not they fall short of the original. At the",

It felt choppy and confusing, and ultimately took away from the emotional impact the story was trying to convey. \ud83d\ude1f\n\n         In contrast, one of the best movie adaptations of a book I have ever seen is The Help. I think the movie did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of the novel, while also making it more accessible to a wider audience.

The original book by Natalie Babbitt is a charming and thought-provoking tale about the idea of immortality, and the movie completely misses the mark. Not only do they make the young girl, Winnie, older, but they also introduce a teenage romance between her and the main character, Jesse, that completely changes the dynamic of the story. The movie also lacks the darker undertones and the themes of mortality and aging that are present in the book. It's unfortunate because the book is a classic and the movie has the potential to introduce it to a new generation, but it falls short in delivering the true essence of the story.",

However, I agree that it's a good movie and a nice faithful adaptation of the story. If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend giving it a watch!\n\n         For more popular adaptations of the book, I would recommend checking out the animated version of The Hobbit: The Animated Movie, which is also quite faithful to the story. It was made in the 1970s, so the animation is a bit dated, but it's still a fun watch if you're a fan of the story.\n\n         If you're looking for a more modern adaptation, you might want to check out The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which is the first of the three movies in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit",

The book has an enchanting, whimsical quality to it that was completely lost in the movie's dark and brooding atmosphere. The characters were unrecognizable and the pacing was all off.\n\n        On the other hand, the Lord of the Rings movies were a magnificent tribute to a masterpiece of fantasy literature.

The Lord of The Rings, on the other hand, was a nearly perfect adaptation.\n\n         To add a little more, I think one of the biggest issues with the Hobbit movie was the decision to make it into three separate films. The original book is already quite short, and it felt like a lot of unnecessary padding was added in order to make the films longer. The pace was also much slower in the movies, which made some of the more action-oriented scenes feel dull.\n\n         On the other hand, the Lord of the Rings movies did a fantastic job of staying true to the source material while also expanding on it in a way that made sense. They were able to create new scenes that added to the story without feeling out of place or unnecessary. Overall, I'm glad I was able to",

The first one is certainly the best of the adaptions, and it does have its moments (especially the opening scenes in the Shire). But the rest of the series doesn't feel quite right. The pacing is uneven, the dialogue is awkward, and the pacing and action scenes are too quick and choppy. It feels more like watching a comic book than a movie, which is not a good thing. The LOTR adaptions are like the M4 book edit - they're there, and there can be a good movie in there, but it's buried under a lot of mistakes and poor decisions.

The original source material was the foundation for the story, and a faithful adaptation should seek to capture that without adding unnecessary changes or retconning important plot points.

It was a real shame as the books were so rich and complex, and the movie just didn't capture that.\n\n         I also thought the casting choices were not very good, with Idris Elba, who played Roland Deschain, not being the most convincing in the role. I think a different actor might have done a better job at portraying Roland's struggles and determination.\n\n         Overall, it was a disappointment and not really a faithful adaptation of the source material.

It's a beautifully crafted, emotionally nuanced story, and the movie just... didn't get it. The pacing was all wrong, the performances were flat, and worst of all, it cut out so much of the emotional depth of the book. I remember watching it and feeling let down, wondering how they could mess up something so good.\n         In terms of your comment of interest, that's an interesting idea! A Ken Burns-style documentary could capture some of the beauty and emotion of the story. Maybe it could even use animation for the time travel aspect. It's definitely worth considering.",

The book follows a format similar to \"The Walking Dead\" where it tells different stories of people surviving the zombie outbreak. The movie tries to cram all of these different stories into a singular narrative and I found the execution to be very poor. Plus the movie doesn't even follow the timeline of the book, which threw me off. I'd say definitely one of the worst movie adaptations of a book I've personally seen.\n\n        This is in the style of the comment history provided, and it incorporates some aspects of the user's previous comment history (e.g., using colloquial language and abbreviations like \"9 months ago\").

The book was a critical examination of totalitarianism and the dangers of surveillance, while the movie seemed to focus more on the action and romance aspects, completely missing the point of the story. Also, Winston Smith was nowhere near as compelling or nuanced in the movie as he was in the book.\n\n        The Outsiders - the movie missed the mark in numerous ways.

I feel the movie left out so many important elements that made the book such a fan favorite.\n         But for me, the movie that takes the cake for worst movie adaptation of a book I loved is The Devil Wears Prada. I thought the book was much funnier and Meryl Streep played Miranda Priestly as a completely different character than the book describes. In my opinion, Miranda should have been more demanding, mean, and icy to really bring the role to life.",

The book is a deep and nuanced examination of race relations in the Deep South, and the lives of black domestic workers in Jackson, Mississippi. The movie, while well-intentioned, oversimplified the story and glossed over the more complex aspects of it, focusing instead on the white women's stories.\n         2) *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee. The book is a classic coming-of-age story that deals with heavy topics like racism, loss, and morality. The movie, while a great adaptation overall, did not capture the novel's themes as well as the book, particularly in the more complex and sophisticated dialogue.\n         I also agree with the comments about *A Walk in the Woods* and *The Dark is Rising,* although I haven't read either of them myself.",

If you want to find a book with a similar atmosphere, I would recommend reading The Winter People by Jennifer McMahon.

While the film captures some of the book's emotional resonance, it seems to be aimed at a much broader audience than the young Latina girls who would have the most to gain from its message.\n        2) \"The Stand\" by Stephen King, directed by Mick Garris.

The chemistry between the two leads in the movie is non-existent compared to the book, and it just doesn't make any sense. The whole movie is a mess.\n        2) Yes, I agree with you about The Dark is Rising. It's a shame that they decided to make the movie in California. They could have filmed it in the UK, where the book is set, and it would have made a big difference. Susan Cooper's novels have a strong sense of place, and it would have been much more effective to capture that in the movie. The movie is just a mess, and it doesn't do the book justice at all.\n        3) Yea, I",

Stuart Hazeldine's adaptation of Jo Nesb\u00f8's novel doesn't come close to capturing the dark, atmospheric, and gripping story that the book offers.\n\n         For anyone unfamiliar with the book, The Snowman follows Detective Harry Hole as he investigates a series of brutal murders in Oslo. As the body count rises, it becomes clear that the killer has a chilling pattern and is always one step ahead of the police. The story is a twisting, turn-filled thriller that leaves readers on the edge of their seats. Unfortunately, the movie adaptation loses much of this tension and excitement, with flat performances, subpar special effects, and a convoluted plot that fails to grab the audience's attention.",

The book had a great mix of action and suspense, while the movie just didn't convey that sense of intrigue and wonder that the book had.\n        2. For me, that would have to be The BFG (by Roald Dahl). I loved the book as a child, and the movie just wasn't the same. The character design was off, and the story just didn't have the same magical feel as the book.\n        3. Without a doubt, it would have to be Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (by J.K.

The series, however, seemed to capture the spirit of the book more effectively. It better portrayed the complexities of Henry and Claire's relationship, as well as the emotional tumult that comes with living two very different lives at the same time. Unfortunately, it was canceled after one season.\n         Another movie adaptation that I felt fell short was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. While the original Swedish films did a great job of bringing the characters and story to life, the American version felt flat and unappealing.

In this case, the commenter is discussing the different adaptations of Rebecca, with a preference for the old Hitchcock film. The user's history suggests that they have strong opinions about personal responsibility and ethics, so they would likely have a negative opinion of the Netflix adaptation due to its soulless and mindless approach to the story.

I guess it's hard to capture the full essence of a book in a 2 hour (ish) movie - but they missed so much of what made the book special. It was also a shame they didn't cast Robert Redford in the movie, because he was the perfect voice for Bryson in the audiobook. I think Bill Bryson, the author, would agree with us that they definitely missed the mark.\n        Another user might respond something like this:\n        While I can appreciate the flaws of the movie, I actually found it an enjoyable way to enjoy a story that I've already read without having to sit down and read the entire book again. The movie focused on different aspects of the story than the book, and while that might not be faithful to the book, it still tells a compelling story. For me,",

The rich, quirky humor is the core of the appeal in reading the Discworld novels, and the narrative is equally essential in drawing the reader into the magical landscape that Pratchett crafted. Even some of the movies like \"Mort\" and \"Hogfather\" fell short in capturing the essence of the Discworld while adhering to a Hollywood script. It would be a daunting challenge to condense the absurdity and sprawling storylines into two hours while staying true to the source material. I think it's safe to say that a Discworld screen adaptation is nearly impossible to pull off without losing the humor, heart, and soul that defines the series.",

In addition to this terrible omission, the film also failed to capture the haunting, otherworldly atmosphere of the book, making it feel more like a generic sci-fi film.

The movie completely missed the mark in capturing the humor and charm of the book.\n        2. *A little romance*, the adaptation of *e=mc\u00b2, mon amour*. They glossed over significant character building bits, turned wholesome characters into bastards, and missed the point of the book in general.",

A Walk in the Woods is a hilarious and entertaining travelogue by Bill Bryson that's filled with his wit and insight on the Appalachian Trail. Reading the book can give you a even more vivid and immersive experience of the journey Bryson took, and you might enjoy discovering the parts of the story that didn't make it into the movie adaptation. Plus, it'll give you something to share with your wife and discuss together!",

The movie was just not as engaging as the book, and even though I knew what was going to happen, I felt like I wasn't fully invested in the characters and the storyline.\n        2. The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman. Despite the talented voice actors, I feel like they really missed the mark with this movie adaptation. The book was rich with complex themes and ideas, and the movie just didn't capture these aspects to the same extent. Additionally, the movie changed some important details from the book that were crucial to understanding the story.\n        3. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I enjoyed the book, but the movie was just really boring. The acting was mediocre, the pacing was slow, and the overall atmosphere of the movie didn't",

The chemistry between the characters was non-existent, the pacing was too fast, and the humor was lost in translation. It's a shame because the book is a beautiful and memorable love story.\n\n        2 comments \n        ShareSaveEdit\n        u/RedditsBestBot\n        2 points \u00b7 2 hr ago\n        I completely agree. Personally, I preferred the book's portrayal of Captain Corelli. He was more mysterious and magnetic on paper.\n\n        0 comments\n        ShareSaveEdit\n        u/FamousCabbage\n        1 point \u00b7 2 hrs ago\n        I've only seen the movie,",

I can only imagine how devastating that must have been for your daughter. It's unfortunate when a movie adaptation ruins someone's love of reading. My heart goes out to her. I hope she finds something that sparks her love for reading again.\n        3. I've always wondered how these decisions are made to adapt books into movies. Sometimes it seems like they miss the mark completely. But hey, at least they're trying to share these stories with a new audience.\n        4. I've seen a few adaptations that were disappointing, but I can't say any were as bad as the ones that destroyed your daughter's love of reading.
