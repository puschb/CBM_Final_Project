    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

You also appreciate a story that allows your imagination to build understanding and expectations based on the context of the story as it unfolds. \"Looking for Alaska\" is a book that might fit your preferences. It's about a teenager named Miles who is sent to boarding school and becomes infatuated with a girl named Alaska who dies. The book explores themes such as loss, grief,",

I personally love \"Hogfather,\" which is a hilarious retelling of the Christmas story with Death as the protagonist. \"Small Gods\" is another fantastic choice, featuring a god who loses his followers and ends up as a simple farmer. Both are excellent choices for a good laugh!",

I'd put Christopher Moore up there with Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett - they're all masters of wit and humor. My personal favorite? Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. It's a hilarious retelling of the Bible story from Biff's perspective, and it was a perfect escape during a tough time in my life. I recommend it to everyone, even those who aren't usually fans of religious-themed books - just for the jokes and the laughs.\n\n        Here's hoping that the next time I'm looking for a good laugh, this thread will remind me to come back and find some new recommendations!",

I love those books, they're always a fun read. Also, try Robert Rankin's \"Brentford\" series, they're a little more bizarre and surreal, but incredibly funny, and they have a similar, easy-to-read style to Korman's.\n\n         And if you're intrigued by the idea of humor in books, but haven't found the right fit yet, I highly recommend \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams, \"Catch-22\"",

Some other favorites of mine are \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\" and \"Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary\", but honestly I wouldn't be able to choose a definitive favorite as all of his books have their own charm.\n\n\t\t\t\tFor example, in \"Naked\", one of the stories that still makes me laugh is the one about trying to learn French and getting confused with the pronunciation. Another one of my favorites is the one about the author's brother who has a fear of death and becomes obsessed with the idea of living forever, even going as far as getting a tattoo of a snake on his arm as a symbol of eternal life.\n\n\t\t\t\tHope you",

Plus, who doesn't love a bit of dark humor? \ud83d\ude04\n\n         The previous user's comment also brings to mind another book that made me laugh, which is **Between** by LL Starling. I can see how reading it makes it even funnier, but listening to the audiobook had me laughing out loud multiple times. I think the narrator does an excellent job of emphasizing the humor in the book. The drunk unicorn might have been my favorite part, but the entire book is packed with jokes and chuckle-worthy lines. Overall, I would highly recommend both Clocktaur Wars",

Based on their comments history (\"Read the requirements for becoming a certified librarian,\" \"Too easy to ban any book,\" \"Some classics,\" \"Options is the best response\") I would say they would appreciate the humor in a book with smart, satirical or snarky writing. They seem to enjoy reading that leans more towards the academic or intellectual side of literature, so a novel with complex characters, a witty and clever plot, and maybe a bit of meta humor might be something they'd enjoy. They may also enjoy a book with a non-traditional perspective or voice, such as one that uses an unusual narrator or perspective that adds an unexpected twist to the story.\n         Here are a few suggestions of books that meet those criteria and are often considered humorous:\n         1.

Reading it at a young age it was absolutely hilarious and I could barely read it without laughing out loud. However, as I grew older my appreciation for it waned and I didn't find it as funny anymore. I recently re-read it as an adult to see if it would still hold up, and unfortunately I found it to be a bit dull and slow-moving, which is not something I had ever noticed before. I'm not sure if it's just because I've grown older or if I've simply seen better humor since then, but it definitely didn't have the same effect on me as it did in my youth. So, I can completely understand the sentiment in your comment. It may be that the books that we find the most hilarious when we're younger simply don't have the same impact on us as we grow older.",

I'm not sure why, but I suspect my reading pace and the way the narrative is presented do not mesh well for me. I will try to make more of an effort to re-read it at some point and see if my attitude has changed, but for now I find it hard to re-read with the same enthusiasm as before. As for audiobooks, I appreciate the suggestion but I prefer to read books myself rather than listening to them.

I'd recommend \"Three Men in a Boat\" by Jerome K. Jerome. It's a comedy classic that has stood the test of time, and the witty humor and ridiculous situations still hold up today. Give it a read, I'm sure you'll find it just as entertaining as ever!\n        \n        2 people marked this as helpful. \\*\n        \n        For instance, the following:\n        The post's title: What books have you read that you wanted to throw across the room?\n        The post's content: I've just finished 'Throne of Glass' by Sarah J Maas.

While it may still be a funny and enjoyable book, the humor and writing style might not hold up as well as it did when it was first published. The cultural and social context has changed, and what was once considered funny may not be as amusing to today's readers. That being said, there are still parts of the book that will undoubtedly make anyone laugh regardless of the time period. For example, the main character's comments and inner monologues are still hilarious and relatable. Overall, I'd say it's still a great book to pick up for a good laugh and a light read, but it might not be as gold standard as it was back then.",

Specifically, the chapters with Jon Snow and Davos Seaworth are always a treat. Their interactions and observations are so witty and clever that I often find myself laughing out loud while reading, especially during some of the more absurd situations they find themselves in. It's a rare thing for me to find a serious, high fantasy book that can balance that with humor so well.\n         Other books that have consistently made me laugh are \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams and \"Good Omens\" by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Both are filled with absurd, dry humor that never fails to amuse me.\n         Hope that helps!\n         \u200b",

It's amazing how society can be so ignorant towards people who are different. I also find the character of Lacey to be a great example of resilience and strength. Reading this book definitely impacted me.\n\n         For me, another book that I enjoy because it's both really funny and has moments that are incredibly sad is Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman. There are parts in the book where I found myself laughing out loud, but there are other parts that made me cry and feel really emotional. I love the character of Eleanor and the way she looks at the world, and the book really makes you think about how we connect with people and how we treat others.\n\n         I'd recommend both of",

Personally, I'd say something like Redshirts by John Scalzi is hilarious. It's basically a send-up of Star Trek and it's got a lot of fun and creative twists to make it stand out. Or if you're looking for something more specific, like sci-fi that makes you laugh, I'd definitely recommend \"Old Man's War\" by John Scalzi as well! It's a great series that uses humor to keep things light even during a serious plot. It doesn't hurt that John Scalzi is a hilarious writer. Good luck on your search for laughs, my friend!",

Wodehouse's other works featuring Mr. Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, like \"Leave it to Psmith\" and \"Jeeves in the Offing\". They're just as delightful and hilarious. If you're already familiar with those, you might also enjoy the works of other authors in a similar style, like \"The Code of the Woosters\" by Benjamin Disraeli or \"The",

It's about a middle schooler named Greg Heffley and his various mishaps and adventures. The humor is childish and relatable, and it still reminds me of my own younger days.\n        2. Another book that made me laugh is \"A Walk in the Woods\" by Bill Bryson. The author recounts his hiking trip on the Appalachian Trail with humor and insight. It's a great read for anyone who enjoys travel and laugh-out-loud humor.\n        3. Finally, the \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" series by Douglas Adams is a classic science fiction comedy that never fails to amuse. It follows the adventures of an irresponsible human named Arthur Dent as he travels through space and encounters various strange and humorous situations.\n\nAll three",

If you're looking for something lighthearted, Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series is a good choice. The first book is The Final Empire.\n        4. If you enjoy mystery, try Christie's Poirot stories. The character is a bit over the top and the jokes are clever.\n        5.

The humor in these stories comes from the outrageous situations Bertie and Jeeves find themselves in, as well as Jeeves's dry, understated wit and Bertie's constant missteps.

They're a great escapist read when I need a pick-me-up.\n\n         Additionally, I think Gordon Korman's I Want to Go Home is a hilarious book as well, as I find the main character's incessant complaints and complaints about being stuck at a summer camp he doesn't want to attend to be very relatable and funny.\n\n         I'd love to hear other people's recommendations for books that make them laugh!\n\n         For instance, the following:\n         The post's title: How do you feel about spoilers in Bookclub discussions",

The protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, is an eccentric and self-deluded character who is both endearing and frustrating in his quest for success and respectability. His dialogue, particularly his interactions with various characters, are often laugh-out-loud funny and the book is filled with witty observations and biting satire.\n        2. The Sellout by Paul Beatty - Another fantastic book that had me laughing throughout. The protagonist, Me, is a young African-American man who decides to reintroduce slavery and segregation in order to prove a point about racism in America. The book is filled with biting satire, witty observations, and hilarious dialogue. It's a highly intelligent and thought-provoking book, but it's also incredibly",

I also loved the main character's neuroses and how he couldn't help but get sucked into absurd situations.\n        2. The Sellout by Paul Beatty - This book made me laugh out loud multiple times, especially because it tackles issues like racism and slavery in a very satirical way. It's also very smart and insightful, challenging you to think about these issues in a new light. I think the humor in this book will stick with me for a long time.\n\n         It's great to see books that have stood the test of time and still make people laugh - I've read A Confederacy of Dunces before and I can confirm that it",

Throughout his descriptions of preparing for the hike, navigating the trail, and encountering various people along the way, Bryson offers hilarious commentary on the absurdities surrounding this type of adventure. The book is a great blend of humor, personal perspective, and insight into the history and geography of the trail. It's a must-read for anyone who enjoys humorous travel literature! \ud83d\udc63\ud83d\ude04",

Whether you're looking for a light, fun read or a deeper exploration of the criminal justice system, Macdeath is a must-read. And if you enjoyed it, I highly recommend checking out the rest of the series - there's nothing quite like the witty, irreverent humor of a Macbeth retelling where the witches are a trio of drag queens!",

Sure, some action stuff happens, but the bot's constant inner thoughts during all of it always cracks me up. The humor brackets sobering moments as well, so it's not constant laughter, but they're still do damn enjoayable. I genuinely love all of them. (The title is somewhat off-putting, but.. trust me.)\n\n        Here's how I would respond:\n\n        Yes! The Murderbot Diaries are absolutely hilarious. Whenever I read the books, I just can't stop laughing at the quirky, dry humor of Murderbot. I love the way it provides some comic relief against the action and serious moments.

The novel is characterized by its absurdist and sometimes darkly comedic portrayal of the military bureaucracy and the absurdity of war.\n\n         Yossarian tries to get out of his military service by any means possible, but is continually hindered by the catch-22 rule which says \"a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes an automatical request to be taken off combat duty, he must be sane enough to fill out the necessary forms.\"\n\n         The novel is full of colorful and memorable characters, such as the Major Major, who is in fact a captain, and Colonel Cathcart, who is known for constantly raising the number of missions required to",

The main character's narration and inner thoughts are witty, insightful, and often humorous, especially when reflecting on the absurdity of high school life. A scene that always makes me laugh is when the main character Charlie first meets his best friend Patrice, who is openly gay, and Patrice immediately notices that Charlie is wearing a Beatles t-shirt under his letterman jacket. Patrice then proceeds to correctly guess all the other bands Charlie listens to and correctly predicts Charlie's entire musical tastes, leading Charlie to exclaim, \"I should have known better than to try to keep my Beatles shirt a secret!\"\n\n        User's comment history:\n        * \"Anne of Green Gables\"",

The way Heller depicts the absurdity of military bureaucracy and the way it affects the soldiers' lives is just perfect. I've read it several times and it never fails to make me laugh.\n\n         Another book that I find really funny is \"Adams New World\" by David Hutchinson. It's a collection of short stories about an adventurous schoolboy named Adam. The way the author writes about the absurd situations Adam finds himself in, and the way he deals with them, is just so tongue-in-cheek and clever. I read it when I was younger and it's",

I love finding books that can do that, because it's always a nice change of pace from the more serious reads I usually go for. It's great that you've found ones that make you laugh consistently! I'll have to check out The Martian and Project Hail Mary at some point. Have you read any other books that made you laugh a lot, or any that you think I might enjoy?\n\n         If you're looking for more light-hearted reads, I'd recommend giving \"Hyperbole and a Half\" by Allie Brosh a try. It's a collection of comedy webcomics, and it had me laughing out loud throughout the entire book. If you enjoy that, you might also like \"Let's Pretend This Never Happened\" by Jenny Lawson or \"You'll Grow Out",

But the Fletch novels, especially the first one, are just a riot to read. If you haven't read them yet, I highly recommend giving them a try!\n\n        ----\n\n        Here's a possible longer answer if you want to expand on it:\n\n        The Fletch novels are a personal favorite of mine for making me laugh. The way Chevy Chase's character, Irwin M. Fletcher, navigates various predicaments is just so absurd and unbelievable that it's impossible not to giggle at. I've read the entire series multiple times and each time",

The absurdity of the plot combined with the snarky and sarcastic voice of the narrator makes it an instant classic for anyone with a twisted sense of humor. Also, another book that always cracks me up is \"A Walk in the Woods\" by Bill Bryson. His dry wit and detailed observations of his hike along the Appalachian Trail make for a hilarious and unforgettable journey. These two books never fail to make me laugh and I find myself revisiting them often.\n         <<END ANSWER>>",

The protagonist is a brilliant individual with unique abilities and an insatiable curiosity, which lends itself to some truly entertaining situations.

It's just so absurd, creative, and hilarious. Same with Vonnegut - I love his humor and his unique way of looking at things. Galapagos is definitely a favorite of mine. There's just something about that book that never fails to make me laugh - the idea of humans evolving to form a kind of \"chimpanzee-human\" is just too ridiculous and entertaining. It's a fantastic book, and a wonderful pick-me-up whenever I need a laugh.",

The letters are over the top, but they're also hilariously accurate in their depiction of the petty politics and snobbery of academia.\n        3. \"Three Men in a Boat\" by Jerome K. Jerome.

The former is a satirical retelling of the life of Jesus from his childhood friend Biff, and the latter is a classic comedy of manners full of witty dialogue and social awkwardness. Despite being written centuries apart, they both have a timeless quality that still resonates and makes me laugh. Have you read either of these?\n\n         For more current authors, some that I have found to be funny are David Sedaris, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and Rainbow Rowell. Sedaris writes essays and short stories that are full of dry wit and social commentary, Rajskub writes about her life as a comedian and mother,",
