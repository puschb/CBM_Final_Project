I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

I completely agree, Pratchett is always a good choice when looking for books that make you laugh and continue to make you laugh! For me, I have to go with *Carpe Jugulum* - the scene where the Witches come to town and start making everyone fall in love is always a favorite!\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe user's comment history reveals that they have an interest in books that are humorous or funny. In the thread, the commenter has mentioned books such as Gordon Korman, Emily Henry, and *I Want to Go Home*, which are all known for their humor. The user's comment about Moby Dick in their comment history is somewhat unrelated, but it does not preclude them from being interested in humorous books. The comment of interest explicitly mentions Pratchett, so the user is likely familiar with",

It's always comforting to have a book that brings you joy (literally or figuratively). While Gordon Korman is great, there's another author you may want to check out if you haven't already: Christopher Moore. I stumbled upon one of his books, _A Dirty Job_, at the library and had to buy it. I've been a huge fan of his work ever since, with favorites like _You Suck_ and _Lamb_ that always make me laugh every time I re-read the books. If you enjoy those types of books, I'd definitely recommend checking out his works.\n\n         As for other authors who inspire laughter, the likes of Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, Catch-22, and _The Confederacy of Dunces_ have also been mentioned",

The book is filled with funny commentary from the protagonist, who has a witty and sarcastic tone throughout the story. I've found that it's a great book for a quick, light-hearted read with plenty of laughs, and it still makes me laugh when I re-read it. It's a classic children's book with timeless humor that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good laugh. Other books that made me laugh include the works of Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, and Robert Asprin.",

The story follows a family who decides to leave their home in Los Angeles and drive north, towards the more rural regions of the state. Along the way, they encounter a series of increasingly bizarre challenges, from getting lost in the desert to running into a post-apocalyptic cult.

Is it a good starting point?\"\n\n        This comment is humorously indicating that the user has heard of Terry Pratchett's work and recognizes it as a series that often elicits laughter, but has never actually read it themselves. By asking if \"Pratchett\" is a good starting point, the user is jokingly asking for advice on whether or not they should start with the discworld series. The use of the phrase \"for years now\" is slightly exaggerated and emphasizes the user's procrastination in reading the series. Additionally, the use of the phrase \"always struggle to get started\" is a common trope in popular discourse about reading, as many people can relate to the difficulties of beginning a new book.

There's a lot of humor in Pratchett's writing, and I can easily see a particular scene making someone laugh hard enough to put the book down. Some of my favorites are the golem Moist Von Lipwig's interactions with the city's elusive con-artist, Mr. Lipwig's conversations with the Ankh-Morpork Roundhouse's officers, and the scene where Lipwig tries to make the Post Office profitable. All three of those scenes have a lot of humor that could make anyone laugh hard enough to put the book down. If I had to guess, it might have been one of those three, but I could also be wrong. In any case, Going Postal is definitely a book that's worth reading again for the laughs.",

The premise is that a border dispute between Ankh-Morpork and Klatch escalates (through the various countries being hilariously bad at international relations) to a massive war that brings out the best (and worst) of both lands and involves the wizards of both lands in a massive battle of wits. The humor is just one level above silly, the characters are fantastic, and the absurdity of the story is just perfect for a good laugh.\n\n        Another favorite is his book \"Thud!\" which I recommend to everyone I know who hasn't read a Pratchett book yet. It's a great starting point, and it's a fantastic look at how culture and tradition can be both amazing and terrible to have. The story revolves around the \"Clan Plain-Man",

I've read them all multiple times and still find myself laughing out loud.\n\n         For a more recent recommendation that has a similar vibe, I'd suggest \"Good Omens\" by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. It's a hilarious, light-hearted take on the end of the world.\n\n         And if you're interested in adult fiction that's still laugh-out-loud funny, check out \"Old School\" by Tobias Wolff or \"Stoner\" by John Williams.

I find myself laughing out loud when I read them, and I can't help but think of his books whenever I need a good laugh. \"Naked\" is one of my favorites, I find the self-deprecating humor and absurd situations he describes to be absolutely hilarious. Have you read any other books by him that you found especially funny?\n\n         For me, I would also add \"I Want To Go Home\" by Gordon Korman to the list. That book always makes me laugh, especially the main character's incessant comments about the camp. I also enjoy \"The Fourteenth Goldfish\" byGF Hale, it's a YA novel about a teenager who wakes up in the body of a 14-year-old boy who happens to be a mad scientist, and the comedy comes from the absurd situations and humor in the book.",

In the same way that you can watch old episodes of Seinfeld and still find them hilarious, you can still find the books to be funny. It's definitely not as funny the umpteenth time you read it, but it's still got moments that will make you laugh. I still pull it off the shelf every couple of years, and still find it to be hilarious. It doesn't really have the same feel as when you first read it, but it's still a classic that holds up just fine. I don't think it's suffered from being improved upon too much to not be the gold standard anymore - maybe it's just that you can find funnier things now, but that doesn't mean it's not still a great book.",

Some people enjoy satire and absurdity, while others prefer witty banter and subtle humor.

I also enjoy reading \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" by Lemony Snicket, which is always sure to elicit a chuckle or two.\n\n        3. I must con",

I find myself laughing out loud as I read through it again and again.\n         Of course, it's everyone's individual opinion on books, and I'm glad to hear that you don't particularly enjoy the book that was mentioned in the post.

Although it is generally classified as a children's book, it is a rich and complex narration that transcends age. I remember reading it for the first time and laughing so hard that I had to put it down several times. I still find myself smiling as I re-read it, even though it has been many years since my initial encounter. The humor in \"Watership Down\" is mostly subtle and dry, making it perfect for those who enjoy wit and sarcasm. The story is a post-dystopian take on the fable of \"The Wind in the Willows,\" complete with endearing animal characters like Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, and General Woundwort. The book follows them on their treacherous journey to find a new warren, with numerous obstacles and challenges along the way. From the elaborate",

Reilly, a 30-year-old librarian who still lives with his mother and is unable to find a job. Despite being highly educated, he is lazy and incompetent, and the novel is a satire of American culture in the 1960s. The Sellout, by Paul Beatty, is a modern take on the same theme, with a more contemporary perspective. It is a dark comedy that deals with issues of racism and identity in America, and is a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

Reilly, the main character, is a hilariously pretentious, overweight, misanthropic man who has an inflated view of his own intellectual abilities but struggles to find true meaning in his life. The way he interacts with the people and events around him, particularly his mother, is an endless source of amusement.\n        2. The Sellout: This book is another recent favorite of mine that combines humor with a strong message about race in America. The protagonist, a young black man living in a post-racial America, tries to reintroduce segregation in order to prove his loyalty to being black. The absurdity and irony of his plan is laugh-out-loud funny, while also serving as a powerful commentary on the state of race relations",

The author, Ian Stewart, uses puns, jokes, and imaginative scenarios to explain mathematical concepts and solve problems. Many of the problems are solvable with a simple mathematical method, but some are more complex and require creative thinking and ingenuity. I find myself chuckling as I work through the problems, and I often revisit the book when I need a math-related laugh or when I want to challenge myself with some interesting problems. I think anyone with an interest in mathematics, humor, or a combination of the two would enjoy this book.",

I read \"\"Journey to the End of the Night\"\" by Louis-Ferdinand Celine when I was around 17 years old, and it was such a hilarious, outrageous read. I've never encountered a book like it before or since. Celine has a way of skewering the absurdity of human behavior that is unparalleled. The central character, Ferdinand, is a relatable anti-hero who navigates through life with razor-sharp wit and a cynical view of the world. The book is an unapologetic, scathing critique of the human condition and the ugliness of humanity, but it's written in such a way that it's impossible not to laugh out loud.

In fact, if you liked the snarky and sarcastic humor in Roughing It, you might enjoy \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.\" It follows the protagonist, Hank Morgan, who is knocked unconscious during a baseball game and wakes up in Camelot during the time of King Arthur. As a pragmatic Yankee, Hank clashes with the knights and their code of honor, and his commentary on the absurdity of medieval court life is absolutely hilarious.\n        2. If you're looking for humorous books along the lines of Gordon Korman, I would recommend \"Louis Sachar's\" books, particularly \"Wayside School series\" and \"Sideways Stories from Wayside School.\" They're about students and",

The humor just makes the descriptions of the wilderness less intimidating and more interesting.

It's a time travel comedy in which a historian goes to World War II era England to retrieve a damaged madonna painting.

I don't reread it often, but it's always a delight when I do.\n\n        4.\n        \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. It's a sci-fi comedy series about a man, Arthur Dent, who gets taken on a grand adventure through the galaxy after Earth is destroyed to make way for a bypass.

I tend to prefer something that's got more substance to it, even in a comedic sense. But, there have been a few that did manage to make me laugh, and that I'll continue to read years later. Off the top of my head are Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen and Hogfather by Terry Pratchett. Pride and Prejudice does a good job of lampooning and satirizing the social classes and norms of the 1800s while also providing a gripping love story. Hogfather is a brilliant satire on Santa Claus and Christmas.\n\n          I have to admit, I didn't get the humor till I was older and had experienced life a bit more. Now, when I read both",

Steel Beach by John Varley is an extraordinary ride with a unique blend of humor and reflection on humanity, definitely one to make you think. I'd say read that one first.\n         As for Douglas Adams, his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series is a classic must-read. It's a satirical science fiction series that's easy to read and always manages to make me laugh.\n         Finally, Christopher Moore writes such engaging, humorous books that it's hard to pick just one. Lamb is a hilariously unorthodox retelling of the nativity story and I think it's a great starting point for Moore's works. Enjoy!",

It's a Victorian ghost story set in 19th-century England, and it's so absurd and ridiculous that I can't help but laugh whenever I read it. Here's my favorite example:\n        * A group of magicians are engaged in a magical game of hide-and-seek, and they take turns trying to disguise themselves as ordinary people and escape detection. One of the magicians, Lord Welling, tries to disguise himself as a country vicar. But he's so badly dressed that he fails to fool anyone.\n        * Another magician, Mr Segundus, tries to take on the identity of a famous musician. He spends hours practicing, but when he finally performs, it's a complete disaster. All anyone can hear is the sound of him hitting wrong notes on his violin.\n        2. \"",

It's a mysterious middle-grade novel that was actually quite heartbreaking and thought-provoking the first time I read it, but it still never fails to make me chuckle every time I pick it up again. The protagonist's witty, whip-smart internal monologue is a big part of why, but the book also has a great sense of humor that comes from its character interactions. It's definitely a favorite of mine.\n        3. \"Prisoner B-3087\" by Alan Gratz. This is another middle-grade novel that is seriously intense and emotional, but it also has some really funny moments. The main character, Marty, is such a likable character and his dialogue with the other characters always leaves me grinning. It's a bit of a serious book overall, but the humor helps to balance it",

It's definitely a classic for its humor and relatability.\n\n        Another book that I find makes me laugh is \"A Confederacy of Dunces\" by John Kennedy Toole. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is a somewhat lazy and eccentric figure in New Orleans in the 1960s. His obsession with various historical figures and his bizarre antics often had me chuckling. The book is a good mixture of humor and a deeper, underlying message about the absurdity of life and society.",

Old Yeller by Fred Gipson - The emotional depth and the coming-of-age story make this book a classic, but the relationship between Travis and Old Yeller is heartbreaking and touching.\n        4.

Lamb sounds like a hilarious, satirical take on the life of Jesus, while Emma is a classic Romantic novel by Jane Austen.\n         Lamb is about a teenage Jesus and his adventures with his childhood friend Biff, while Emma tells the story of a young woman living in early 19th century England who is struggling to find love.\n         I've heard great things about both books, but personally I'd be more likely to pick up Lamb for a good laugh.",
