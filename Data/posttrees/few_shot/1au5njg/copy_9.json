It's a wild ride with a very creative and unique storyline.\n        2. \"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\" by Douglas Adams - This book is a part of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, and it's filled with witty and absurd humor that makes me laugh every time I read it. The characters and situations are so well written that they're impossible not to love.\n        3. \"I Hate Fairyland\" by grant Morrison - It's a hilarious and twisted graphic novel that takes a dark and satirical look at the fairy tale genre. The artwork is also fantastic and adds to the overall hilarity of the book.\n        4. \"The Hitchhiker",

It's hard to pick a favorite though - each book has its own charm, and most of them will make you laugh. Some personal favorites:\n\n        * Men at Arms - a book about the Watchmen in Ankh-Morpork, and the introduction of Sam Vimes, the Commander of the City Watch. This book is also a fun introduction for the Discworld series for anyone who doesn't already know of it, as it has many fun and absurd characters while still being a fairly standalone book.\n        * The Hogfather - a funny Christmas story taking place in Discworld. The main character here isn't a normal one - it's the spirit of Hogfather, the Discworld's equivalent of the Santa Claus, who is trying to complete his deliveries on Christmas Eve",

However, it is filled with dark humor and clever wit that kept me entertained throughout. It's a historical fiction novel about a woman during WWI and a modern-day woman that intertwines both periods, and the characters are brilliantly written. I find the dialogue between these characters to be hysterical and well-balanced.\n\n        3. \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman - This heartw",

Also, When You Are Engulfed in Flames is a great comedy too. I really enjoy his unique perspective on life, and how he tells the stories in a way that's both humorous and relatable. I always find myself laughing out loud when I read anything by David Sedaris.\n\n        Another book that comes to mind is White Oleander by Janet Fitch. I know it's not known for being a comedy, but there are some really hilarious parts in that book that crack me up every time I read it. The characters are so quirky and the narrator's voice is really entertaining.\n\n        Lastly, I have to recommend The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion.

His humor and story-telling ability truly never ceases to amaze me.\n\n        \n        For another laugh, I highly recommend \"Furiously Happy\" by Jenny Lawson.

A particular favorite for me is her story about the stuffed animal she kept in her bed as a young adult.

So, I would highly recommend listening to the audiobook for anyone who found the first part of the book too heavy to read.\n\n         For those who prefer to read, I'd suggest books like *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams, which is a hilarious and witty novel that's full of satire and clever humor.

I still laugh every time I think about Regret.\n        \n        Another book that always makes me laugh is *Three Men in a Boat* by Jerome K. Jerome.

They're written beautifully and even better upon rereading the series. The series is about the Baudelaire orphans who keep falling into unfortunate situations at the hands of the evil Count Olaf. I can't recommend this series enough, and it never fails to bring a smile to my face.\n\nThe more I think about it though, the more I realize that so many books I've read in the past bring a smile to my face when I encounter them again. Whether it's the tone of the book itself or specific passages I find funny, there's always something that brings a smile. I think that's one of the great things about books - they can bring joy and laughter in ways that other mediums may not. So to your question, what books make you",

Both are memoirs, but Bryson's tales of the Appalachian Trail and trying to hike it in his 60's are absolutely ridiculous and his encounters with bears and moose had me in stitches. And his explanations of science made everything seem amusing, even though it's actual science. Also, Neil Degrasse Tyson's Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is a great read because it's an enjoyable and informative overview of almost everything in the universe, all while being able to laugh at the absurdity of it all. Space is such a weird and fascinating place! I've also giggled my way through John Dies at the End",

But I find myself cackling at places where I barely even got a smile when I read it for the first time. There are also some sections that I love and found hilarious the first time, but I find myself less entertained upon rereading it. I find that's particularly true of Zophistics section (although that might be because I've come to appreciate Aristophanes more as I've grown older, so the humor just doesn't land as well as it used to).\n        I could go on endlessly about which parts of the book gave me hearty laughs, but to me the real take away is how adaptable it is to different moods and humor preferences.

It's a true classic, and I highly recommend checking it out if you haven't already.\n\n         In terms of other books that still make me laugh, I'd have to go with \"Hyperbole and a Half\" by Allie Brosh.

It's a fun and creative take on classic fairy tales, and it's a series I continue to revisit often. If someone is looking for a book that will make them smile and also provide a great adventure, I would definitely recommend this one. Happy reading!",

Some humor can be too childish, and some humor gets so lost in its own word play that it's hard to keep track of what's actually funny. That's why I usually just avoid books that are mainly comedy, unless they're really recommended. And since you said they're mainly set in the 1920s in London and NYC, I do have to admit I'm not exactly the target demographic for that kind of period setting either.

His ineptitude and unwitting misunderstandings provide plenty of amusement, and the book also takes a satirical look at various aspects of Southern culture.\n        2.

It's not a traditional source of laughs, but the sharp wit and biting sarcasm are certainly worthy of a chuckle or two.

Reilly, Myra Minkoff, and the others are definitely not people you'd want to spend time with in real life, but the absurdity of their situations and the insight into their thoughts makes it all the more hilarious. And while Jones may not be the protagonist, he's definitely someone you can root for. I can definitely see why A Confederacy of Dunces has been so difficult to adapt into a movie - it's hard to capture the same level of absurdity and humor that the book has.\n\n         The Book Thief by Marcus Zusak is another book that has a similar kind of humor. The absurdity of the narrator, Death, combined with the grim setting and circumstances of the book make for a unique and laugh-out-loud kind of comedy.",

It has a unique charm that keeps me coming back, but it's not necessarily a book I reread often.\n\n        2. The Sellout by Paul Beatty - This is a newer read for me, but it was absolutely delightful. The satirical exploration of race, culture, and identity in America was both biting and clever. The characters and situations were often laugh-out-loud funny, but there was also a sharp political commentary that made me think long after I finished the book. I'd definitely recommend it.\n\n        3. I Want To Go Home by Gordon Korman - This book",

Plus, it's always a joy to discover new books that make you laugh, so I encourage anyone who has been hesitant to give it a try to take the plunge!\n\n         Another book that always makes me chuckle is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.

I'm not quite to the end yet, but it seems like the world and supporting characters are growing more complex with each installment, which keeps things interesting.

Pat McManus is one of my all-time favorites for making me laugh out loud. \"A Fine and Pleasant Misery\" is one of my favorites, with tales of outdoorsmen getting into predicaments, usually of their own making, and the absurd lengths they go to in order to fix their problems.

His writing just takes you to a completely insane world that makes you laugh, even if it's at the complete absurdity of the situation. I would also recommend anything by Dav Pilkey. Captain Underpants, for example, is a great read for anyone looking for some light-hearted humor. Not only is it full of illustrations, but the storyline and characters are consistently hilarious. I still find myself laughing at the same parts even after re-reading them multiple times. Another author I would recommend is Terry Pratchett, although his books are more geared towards adults, they are still full of humor that even a child would find entertaining.

The absurdity of the situation with the military, the character Yossarian's commentary throughout the book make it a comedic classic for me. I can still hear the character 'Doc Daneeka' in my head repeating \"You're insane and you have to fly more missions.\" I've also found that sometimes I'll come across a section randomly and just laugh out loud because it's so funny. Such a great book, even if it is slightly depressing as well, but that's part of its charm. Highly recommend!",

The combination of fantasy and humor, with the characters having their own distinct voices and personalities, always has me giggling. Some of my favorite lines are \"The only good thing about the post being vacant was that we were not in it\" and \"The trouble with being in a squad car is that if you drive too fast you run the risk of getting airborne. And if you drive too slow, everything seems to be closing in on you like a crowd of over-enthusiastic friends shouting 'we're all here now!' and trying to get in the car.\"",

I can read them over and over again and still find new joke that make me laugh.\n\n         Another book that always makes me laugh is \"The Three Musketeers\" by Alexandre Dumas.

I particularly enjoy the scenes with Porthos and Athos, as their dynamic and interactions are consistently funny.\n\n         Lastly, \"Catch-22\" by Joseph Heller is a book that never fails to make me laugh.

So much so that it feels like she's being ostracized and bullied by her peers, even though it's not overt, as the kids don't understand her. She's very sensitive and very intelligent, which leads to her having very specific and sometimes idealized ideas about how things should be.

The witty banter between characters has stayed with me over the years.\n         * The Martian by Andy Weir - A fun, lighthearted book about an astronaut stranded on Mars that uses science and humor to explain the scenarios.

It's a comic science fiction series that follows the character Arthur Dent as he navigates the universe after Earth is destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway. The humor in the book is dry and witty, and the absurdity of the situations the characters find themselves in makes for a delightful read. I discovered the series as a teenager and it became an instant favorite, and it remains so to this day. I've re-read it several times, and every time I pick up the book, I find something new to laugh at. One of the most memorable scenes for me is when the characters are given a Vogon poetry recitation, which is intentionally terrible and maddening, but it's also incredibly funny in a way that only Douglas Adams can pull off.

I definitely agree with the previous commenter that the audio book version is even funnier because the reader's inflection and tone really bring the humor to life.",

Each time I read it, I found myself laughing out loud again and again. The author really does a great job of capturing the humor in a 12-year-old girl's struggle to survive alone on an island for 18 years.\n\n        Some of my favorite funny moments include when she catches fish by stringing up bird feathers to mimic seagulls, when she finds a cave that makes the perfect home, and when she plays tricks on the Native Americans who try to rescue her.\n\n        I have always loved this book, and it is one that I have continued to revisit over the years. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a light-hearted yet captivating",

It's a humorous retelling of the Nativity story with a couple of centuries-old satyrs as protagonists. The absurd, sometimes bawdy humor is a perfect antidote to real-world worries.\n\n         As for *John Dies at the End*, I haven't read it myself, but I've heard it's a wild and wacky ride, just like Moore's other books. If you enjoyed *Lamb*, I think you'd find *John Dies at the End* right up your alley!\n\n         Keep laughing, and happy reading!",

(If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.\n        User's comment history: ['The Odyssey! I was absolutely enthralled.

I read it a few years ago, but some of the jokes are just so absurd and weird that they still make me laugh whenever I think about them.\n\n         I'd recommend both of these books to anyone who's looking for a good laugh.

And I can't forget \"A Walk in the Woods\" by Bill Bryson, which is a humorous travelogue that chronicles Bryson's attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail.

Another standout is \"Eleanor & Park\" by Rainbow Rowell; the characters' snarky wit and evolving relationship provide plenty of laughs.\n\n         For an older audience, \"A Wild Sheep Chase\" by Haruki Murakami is a darkly comedic novel that follows a protagonist on a surreal quest to design a corporate mascot.",

If you haven't read it, Harry Flashman is a former public-school boy and veteran of the Crimean war who, upon meeting the young George Herbert, reminisces about his exploits around the world. It's a rollicking adventure with plenty of hilarious moments. The first book, \"Flashman\" (or \"Flashman of the Anglesey Shore\" if you're reading the original title) is the best place to start, but they're all great reads.\n         The author, George McDonald Fraser, did a fantastic job of portraying Flashman's buffoonery, arrogance, and sex-obsessed personality while still making him a sympathetic character. The narrator is Flashman himself, who is reflecting on his past misadventures, making the reader feel as though they are in on the joke.\n         Give them",

I like a book that can make me laugh out loud and he had me doing that multiple times on the train to work.\n\n         Another funny book that comes to mind is Nick Hornby's High Fidelity. If you're a music lover, you'll understand all of the references and appreciate the humor.\n\n         And if I'm looking for something more young adult, Rainbow Rowell's Attachments is still one of my favorites. It's about a newspaper intern who is tasked with reading and censoring email threads between two newspaper employees. It's a funny, heartwarming read and is a great pick-me-up if you're having a tough day.\n\n         Hope that helps you find some new books to laugh at! Good luck with your summer reading",

The books are set in a fantastical world on a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants, who in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle swimming through space. Despite the absurd premise, Pratchett manages to satirize various aspects of human society, from politics and religion to education and the media, in a way that is both entertaining and insightful. One of my favorite characters in the series is Sam Vimes, a cynical and grumpy police commander who struggles to maintain order in a city that is constantly going to hell in a handbasket. One of the best books in the series is \"Men at Arms\", in which Vimes and his officers are tasked with finding a stolen sapphire that is the size and shape of its owner's head.

I too find the use of asterisks amusing and a clever way to make the endings more shocking. In a way, it highlights the irony of life in a technology-driven society, where the things people value the most can be taken away in an instant.
