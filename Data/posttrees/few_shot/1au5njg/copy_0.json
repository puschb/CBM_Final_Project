I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

            "comment_text": "I enjoy laugh out loud (LOL) books with great plot lines and plenty of humor. One of my favorites that always keeps me giggling is \"Crazy Stupid Love\" by Dan Kois. The story is about a man named Dan who is happily married but has a midlife crisis after finding out his father is remarrying after a thirty-year separation. As Dan navigates his way through this tumultuous time in his life, he discovers that love is not always what it seems. The book is filled with witty dialogue and unexpected plot twists that make it a must-read for anyone looking for a book that will make them laugh and think.\n         Another book that never fails to amuse me is \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. This science fiction novel follows the adventures of an unnamed protagonist who sets out to find the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.",

If you find something that you like regardless of whether it fits neatly into the category of \"\"adult\"\" or \"\"YA\"\" then good for you! The fact that something is marketed as being for a certain audience doesn't mean it has to fit into that box perfectly, and just because it doesn't has nothing to do with your enjoyment of it.",

I loved the series \u201cThe Broken Empire\u201d by Mark Lawrence. The main character is so unlikable that it's almost comical, and the humor in the series is clever and wry. The books are dark fantasy, but I'd say they're more like anti-hero fantasy. Definitely worth a read if you're looking for something a little irreverent and funny.\n\n        Another one that comes to mind is \u201cThe Discworld Series\u201d by Terry Pratchett. While it's not necessarily laugh-out-loud funny, it has a dry wit and clever social commentary that still amuses me to this day.\n\n        Lastly, I'd recommend \u201cGood Omens\u201d by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. It's a funny, lighthearted take on the apocalypse and features some truly memorable characters. If you",

It's a brilliant satire of the human condition, with a cast of absurd and unforgettable characters that you'll love. Lots of clever humor and social commentary, while still being a fun and engaging read. It's set in a fictional city on a disc-shaped planet and follows the adventures of the inept Mayor of Ankh-Morpork, Vetinari, as he tries to deal with the chaos that arises from the arrival of the magical If-series of books that have the power to change reality.

The book's protagonist is not likeable or charming but he is just bizarre and ridiculous enough to be hilarious as he travels from body to body.\n\n         If you want more classic recommendations, I loved and still laugh at _Slapstick_ by Kurt Vonnegut, and _The Fault in Our Stars_ by John Green, despite its tragic elements.",

The scene you're referring to is the one where Moist von Lipwig tries to woo Adora Belle Dearheart by pretending to know about rare coins and then accidentally dropping an actual valuable one on the floor. The way he tries to play it off and then gets dragged into more and more ridiculous attempts to acquire her favors is just hilarious.

Plus, the books are very easy to read and don't require much energy to get into, so they're perfect for when you just want to relax and laugh.",

Specifically, \"Reaper Man\" and \"Mort\" always make me laugh.\n        2. Also, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams is another funny book I've re-read multiple times.\n        3. For something lighter but still hilarious, I love reading \"Hyperbole and a Half\" by Allie Brosh. It's a collection of comics that are absurdly funny and relatable.",

If you're a first-time reader, I'd suggest starting with 'The Color of Magic' and seeing where it leads you. For those who have already read the series, 'Small Gods' and 'The Light Fantastic' are great re-reads for a good laugh.\n\n        For other recommendations, I suggest 'White Teeth' by Zadie Smith, 'Catch-22' by Joseph Heller, and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' by Douglas Adams.",

It's a science fiction novel that follows the story of Arthur Dent, a rather ordinary British man who finds himself catapulted into space after Earth is destroyed to make way for a hyperspace express route. Alongside him is Ford Prefect, an alien posing as a writer, who takes him on a wild journey across the galaxy, meeting various bizarre and humorous characters along the way.\n\n         What I love about this book is that it's genuinely funny, with witty dialogue, absurd situations, and clever jokes that make you laugh out loud. It's also a smart and thought-provoking book, with lots of satire, commentary on human nature, and philosophical insights hidden beneath the humor. It's the perfect balance between intelligent writing",

I think his books are a great choice if you're looking for a book that will never fail to make you laugh. I read at least one of his books every year, and I look forward to each re-read.

I read it when I was a teenager, and I have read it at least 20 times since then, and I still laugh at various parts. Some of my favorite lines include:\n\n         - \"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.\"\n         - \"The first rule of hole club is: Don't talk about hole club.\"\n         - \"I do not believe that human beings can colonize space anytime in the foreseeable future.\"\n         - \"Nature finds a way.\"\n\n         I have also always enjoyed the humor in Douglas Adams' works, particularly \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" which is a quirky, irreverent, and often hilarious take on the concept of intergalactic travel.

The Little House on the Prairie series is a popular choice for humor in literature, and it's great that it still resonates with them even after rereading it at an older age. It's worth noting that sometimes humor can be subjective, so it's always interesting to discover new books that make people laugh.\n\n         Here's a suggestion for the user (and perhaps others): If you like the humor in The Little House on the Prairie series, you might also enjoy A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. It's a humorous travelogue about Bryson's attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail, and it's written in a similar style to the Little House books. Another humorous book that comes to mind is Three Men in",

The humor is just so clever and witty, making it a delight to read over and over again. The story follows a slightly depressed Englishman, Arthur Dent, who is inadvertently dragged out into space, and it's just hilarious and absurd. There are several ways you can experience it - the original 5 radio series, the 6 books, or one of the various TV and film adaptations. I adore it all equally.\n\n         If you're looking for something more modern, I also love anything by John Green. Though his books are a bit more serious, there's still a lot of humor to be found in them. My personal favorites are Paper Towns and Turtles All the Way Down, but Looking for Alaska is a classic.

It's a perfect balance of humor and heart that will leave readers laughing and hoping for more adventures with the Raven Boys.\n         If you're looking for a standalone laugh-out-loud book, I would highly recommend *The Love Song of Jonny Valentine* by Teddy Wayne.

Maarten Troost, has a witty and humorous writing style that really brings the characters and their absurd situations to life. The book follows the author's experiences as a journalist in Papua New Guinea, and it's filled with cultural clashes, hilarious misunderstandings, and some unforgettable characters. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a light-hearted read that will keep you laughing for hours (or at least until the next time you re-read it).\n\n         As for the other books listed, I haven't read either of them, but I can say that they both seem to have a similar tone of humor and wit as The Sex Lives of Cannibals. I would imagine they would also be books that make you laugh and continue to",

It's mostly a first-person perspective with a bunch of slapstick humor and wordplay, and many of the funny bits wouldn't translate well to visual media. Plus, since the book is set in New York in the early 80s, there'd be a huge risk of the humor feeling dated or irrelevant by today's standards.\n\n         Maybe a TV series adapted in a similar style to Arrested Development could work? I haven't read the book beyond excerpts, so I don't know if there's enough material for a long-format adaptation. But if there were, something like that could give enough wiggle room for adapting the humor and wordplay to modern audiences.\n\n         It's always a shame when great books get lost in development hell. We'll always have the written version.",

The book is truly a masterpiece of satire, and the humor is timeless.\n\n         When I first read it, I could not stop laughing. I still find myself quoting lines to friends and family members, who often don't get the reference.

I also enjoy \"A Walk in the Woods\" by Bill Bryson, which is about his hike along the Appalachian Trail. It's a hilarious account of the absurd things that can happen on a long-distance hike, and the descriptions of the trail's various characters are priceless. Another funny book I'd recommend is \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. It's a humorous science fiction story about a man who is forced to leave Earth to make way for a new hyperspace expressway, and the absurd adventures he has in space. These books are all great for a laugh and guaranteed to brighten your day.",

The witty dialogue and deadpan humor in the book is a delight to read, especially when it comes to the young protagonist Mattie Ross. Her no-nonsense attitude towards the men around her, particularly in her dealings with the hired guns, is incredibly entertaining. The book's depiction of the frontier West and the colorful cast of characters adds an extra layer of comicality that makes it a must-read for anyone looking for a good laugh. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading it, I highly recommend giving it a try. And if you have, it's never too late for another read-through. Happy laughing!",

I also appreciate the way Pratchett tackles complex issues while still maintaining a light-hearted tone. My personal favorites are mort, small gods, and night watch.\n        3. Three Men in a",

The absurd situations and wit of the main character, Yossarian, make it a book that never fails to make me laugh. Even though it's a war novel, the humor is what really shines through, and it's a great reminder that there's always a silver lining, no matter the situation. The book is a satire on the bureaucracy and absurdity of war, and the way Heller writes about the characters and their interactions is just too funny to pass up. It's a classic for a reason, and I think it would be a great choice for anyone looking for a book that will make them laugh and continue to make them laugh even after multiple re-reads.",

Huckleberry Finn is another example of that, the humor isn't overt but it's there, and it still makes me laugh after reading it multiple times. Another book that's been a guaranteed laugh for me is \"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\" by Susanna Clarke. It's a bit more subtly humorous than Twain but it does have its moments, and the narrative voice is always amusing. I particularly enjoyed the interjections of other contemporary works of literature, like Austen and Byron, trying to explain the mystical world of the novel to each other. It added an extra layer of humor to an already funny book.",

His self-deprecating humor and vivid descriptions of his experiences make it a must-read for anyone who enjoys a good laugh.\n        3. The Goodbye to All That by F.

The humor is so dry and clever, and the characters are absolutely ridiculous, but in the best way possible. I've re-read the books multiple times and they still make me laugh just as much as they did the first time. The book's protagonist, Arthur Dent, is a normal everyman sucked into a wildly absurd space adventure, and the supporting characters are equally eccentric. The humor is usually in the form of witty dialogues or absurd situations that catch you off guard, but it's always delivered in a way that makes you chuckle. Plus, the book asks interesting questions about the nature of reality and existence, which is a bonus.\n\n         However, if you're looking for something more grounded in reality, I would also recommend The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion.

I just re-read Grave Peril, and I was laughing so hard I had to put it down multiple times. Butcher has such a unique and clever writing style that never fails to amuse me. Other books that occasionally make me laugh are Ender's Game and the Harry Potter series, but those two are few and far between. The Dresden Files, however, is one I go back to again and again (and again) for a guaranteed laugh.",

I completely agree. The Janet Evanovich books are a constant source of hilarity and fun. And Grandma Mazur is the best! I just love how she always gets herself into these crazy situations and yet somehow manages to come out on top. The way she talks and thinks is just so amusing and unique. And the mystery and suspense in these books are a perfect combination with all the humor. I've read all of the books in the Stephanie Plum series and I can't wait to read more.
