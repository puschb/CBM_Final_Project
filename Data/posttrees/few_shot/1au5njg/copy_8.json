I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

The humor in it never gets old for me because it's just spot on for someone who's trying to navigate that age in life. I find her self-deprecation and willingness to put herself out there so charming. I even tried out a few of the recipes in the book (like her roast chicken with pomegranate sauce), and they were great!\n\n         For a more recent one, I enjoyed 'Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine' for the way it dealt with Eleanor's quirks and strange mannerisms. I found her journey both touching and funny, and I re-read it to relive her journey. I also found her relationship with the main male character to be cute and uplifting.",

The first few books have a steeper learning curve as the world is being built up around you, but they're definitely worth sticking with!\n\n        [+105 points, -0 points](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hkfqwu/books_that_made_you_laugh_and_continue_to_make/)\n        \u00b7\n        a month ago\n\n        Oh yeah, anything by Terry Pratchett. *Good Omens* was probably the first I read that made me laugh so hard I almost couldn't breathe",

My personal favorites are \"Guards! Guards!\", \"Small Gods\", and \"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\".\n\n         For instance, in \"Guards! Guards!\", the city of Ankh-Morpork hires a dragon to protect it from a burglar gang, only for the dragon to turn out to be an underachieving and rather clumsy dragon who causes more chaos than anything else. In \"Small Gods\", the book follows Brutha, a follower of the cult of Om, as he searches for a way to prove Om exists in the face of evidence to the contrary. The book is full of witty dialogue and satirical comparisons to real-world religions. And in \"The Amazing Maurice and His Educ",

Many readers enjoy his unique blend of humor, satire, and fantasy, and often find his books funny even upon re-reading.\n\n        2. More specifically, one book that often gets mentioned is \"The Color of Magic,\" which introduces readers to the Discworld universe and many of its recurring characters. It's a fun, quirky, and often humorous book that many people enjoy.\n\n        3. It's also worth noting that Pratchett's books have a special place in the hearts of many readers, and are often reread even by people who aren't big fans of fantasy or humor. There's just something magic about his writing that keeps readers coming back for more.\n\n        4. The user's comment history suggests that they may also enjoy",

One particular scene that stands out for me is when the main character, Nicholas, attends a fancy-dress ball and ends up in a ridiculous pair of tights and a dress.

It's a strange and off-beat story, but the humor really shines through in the dialogue and character interactions. If you enjoyed \"I Want To Go Home\", I would definitely recommend giving \"Lamb\" a try!\n\n        2. I agree with you, Gordon Korman is a really hilarious author. One of my favorites is \"Restaurant at the End of the Universe\". The book takes place in a spaceship restaurant and the crew's adventures are just absurd and funny.

Thanks for the recommendation! Keep on recommending great books! \ud83d\ude4c\n        Another classic one of mine that still makes me laugh every time I read it is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. The absurdity and silliness of the characters and situations is just amazing and never fails to make me laugh out loud. If you're in the mood for something light-hearted and funny, I highly recommend giving it a try!\n        What books do you find yourself still laughing at, even after multiple reads?

It's a mix of science fiction and satire, and the main character, Arthur Dent, is an everyman who is constantly finding himself in outrageous situations. The humor is in the situations he finds himself in, the characters he meets, and the absurd reasoning behind them.\n        2. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - The humor is more subtle, but it's there. It's in the characters' witty banter, their sardonic observations, and the societal norms they have to navigate. It's a classic romance novel, but the humor is what keeps it fresh and interesting.\n        3. The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins - The humor is dark and often sarcastic, but it",

I remember feeling similar when I first picked up _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. It was praised so much online, and in my circle of friends, that I went in with sky-high expectations. While the humor is quite clever and entertaining, I did find myself a bit underwhelmed as well during my first read-through. However, I ended up re-reading it several times because of the nostalgia factor, and I eventually grew to appreciate its wit and charm. I think it's important to approach the book without expectations, and perhaps give it another go. After all, humor is subjective, and what doesn't click right away might hit the mark in a second reading. Hopefully you'll come to enjoy it as much as I do!\n\n        2. For the post itself, it",

Bravo on your recommendation \u2013 Three Men in a Boat is a timeless gem that'll never cease to tickle the funny bone. If you haven't had the pleasure, do yourself a favor and give it a go.\n\n         I, too, love Michael Innes' Appleby and Appleby and Inspector Gervaise Fen. Not only are they witty, clever mysteries, but the comedic banter between the characters keeps me chuckling. In fact, I can't wait to crack",

The book being recommended in the comment about \"Three Men in a Boat\" is another book with the same title, \"Three Men in a Boat\" by Jerome K. Jerome, which is a humorous novel about a boat trip on the Thames River in England and is not related to the children's book mentioned in the original post.

The humor in these books doesn't always translate well to real-life situations, and it's important to remember that they're fiction and not a guide to how we should treat people in real life.\n\n        That being said, these books are definitely worth a read if you're looking for something light and funny.

Maarten Troost about his experiences living among the Korowai people of West Papua, Indonesia. With his sharp wit and keen sense of humor, Troost chronicles his adventures in a way that will keep you laughing from start to finish.\n\n        In The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal, Christopher Moore re-imagines the life of Jesus through the comedic narration of Biff, Jesus' childhood friend. The book is filled with clever humor and witty dialogue that will have you laughing out loud.\n\n        I highly recommend all three books for a good laugh!",

However, a book that always makes me laugh is \"A Walk in the Woods\" by Bill Bryson. It's a humorous account of Bryson's attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail, and it's full of funny anecdotes and observations about the trail and the people he meets along the way. It's a great book to read if you're looking for a lighter, more humorous read.\n\n         This user has shown an interest in the book \"We Have Always Lived in the Castle,\" but has not expressed any previous interest in humorous books. When responding, it's important to offer a suggestion for a book that is likely to appeal to the user, taking into account their previous interests. In this case, since the original post was about humorous books, I recommend \"A Walk",

The humor is really something else, and the fact that the character wants to get away from the camp but keeps getting himself into further trouble just makes it even funnier. I've always found John Candy to be a great comedic actor, he would have been perfect for the film adaptation. Too bad the film didn't get made, it would have been a classic.\n         For another book that makes me laugh, I think \"A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams is another great one. The humor is very British and the outrageous scenarios and characters really make me chuckle every time I read it. I've been recommending that book to people for years and it never fails to get a laugh. It's a great read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for something light and funny.",

The characters are all incredibly quirky and it's full of unexpected twists that had me laughing aloud while reading.\n         I'd love to hear more about Aussie books that make people laugh - would recommend any other favourites you guys have?\n         Here's hoping I enjoy \"Downunder\" as much as everyone else does!",

The way the narrative unfolds, the characters' quirks, and the strange situations they find themselves in had me giggling from start to finish. It's smart, funny, and wonderfully improbable, and the fact that I can re-read it and still find it hilarious is a testament to Adams' excellent writing.\n\n        2) Another hilarious book I always come back to is A Series of Unfortunate Events, by Lemony Snicket. The dry, sarcastic tone, combined with the ridiculousness of the events that befall the Baudelaire siblings, always makes me chuckle. Plus, having read the first book as a kid myself, it holds a special place in my heart. It's a great series for anyone who",

It's a great book about mental health and relationships, but it's also really funny. I remember laughing so hard reading it the first time, and still find it funny when I read it again.

The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek (Politics/History) - It's mostly funny because of the horrified reactions to some of the things he says in it from people who have otherwise reasonable beliefs. It just shows how strong group mentality can be and how hard it is to shake off the influence of the crowd\n        3. I Am Legend, The Maze Runner, and Hunger Games (Post-apocalyptic/sci-fi) - Again, the ridiculousness and absurdity of people in a wasteland is a great source of comedy, especially when combined with people who seem to",

It's a satirical retelling of the Nativity story from the perspective of Biff, the son of God. I always find it amusing, and the humor only becomes more apparent upon re-reads. The dialogue is especially funny, with Moore's sarcastic and witty writing style really shining through. Highly recommend it if you're in the mood for a light-hearted and humorous take on the Nativity story!",

Both of these books have a mix of humor and a little bit of the absurd, which I find amusing. Additionally, I often find myself laughing at characters' reactions to events in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke or The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern. I think the key is to find books that have a sense of humor that aligns with your own, whether it's dry, sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek, or something else entirely.\n         For instance, a previous comment in the thread could be responded to with:\n         I can see how The Outsiders would make you laugh, it's a bit of a classic!
