I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

There's not a single book in the series that fails to make me snort or outright laugh out loud.

When I listen to an audiobook, I find that I'm much less capable of mentally imagining the scenes and events in the book, and I have a terrible time trying to visualize a different character's voice and facial expressions.  I'd much rather read a book instead.  Am I missing out on something?",

Another book that I find funny every time I read it is \"The Help\" by Kathryn Stockett. It's about a white woman in the 60s in Mississippi who hires two black maids to work for her and tells their stories. It's not as funny as the other two, but it has some really funny moments.

His writing is so clever and witty that it's impossible not to laugh out loud when reading some of the passages, especially during the awkward social situations and comedic encounters. Plus, the more you read him, the more you recognize his humor, which makes it even funnier the second (or third, or fourth) time around. I also appreciate how he turns everyday observations and experiences into hilarious stories that we can all relate to on some level.\n\n         On another note, if you're looking for more books with a similar humor style to David Sedaris, you might enjoy Bill Bryson's books, particularly Notes from a Small Island and A Walk in the Woods. The writing in those books is also very clever and witty, and both authors have a knack",

The book series is a great read for all ages, and the movies and TV show adaptations are also fun to watch. I've read the books multiple times and the humor never gets old.\n         The first book \"The Bad Beginning\" introduces the Baudelaire orphans who have lost their parents in a mysterious fire and are left in the care of their evil relative Count Olaf. The children are very clever, resourceful, and make the best of bad situations throughout the series. The books are a great mix of humor and tragedy, and the twists and turns in the plot keep you guessing what will happen next. I highly recommend this series if you're looking for a funny book that will continue to make you laugh.\n         I also enjoyed \"Hitchhiker",

It's a timeless classic that perfectly captures the ridiculousness of university life and provides an endless source of amusement.\n        Another book that always brings a smile to my face is Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury*. To understand the narrative we must follow an assortment of strange characters, including a mentally unstable young man, an elderly woman reflecting on her life, and a black servant in the Deep South. The irony, subtle humor, and engaging dialogue never fail to entertain me. It's like a delicious, complex dish that delights both the mind and the comedic bone.",

I think Paul Fotheringay-Phipps is one of the most comedic characters I've come across in literature. His attempts to navigate the absurd world of academia are always a source of amusement, and his haughty mannerisms and overblown sense of self-importance are both endearing and laugh-out-loud funny. I can imagine him saying the same things as your teenager character in Gordon Korman's *I Want to Go Home*.\n         Definitely! *Decline and Fall* is a classic of British comedy, and I",

It's a darkly humorous novel about a man named Binder who discovers that he is a shepherd in a rural area, and he also happens to have a sheep as his best friend who is also half-man. The sheep is named Adam Smallpiece and is the reincarnated Jesus, and they go on a road trip together to find the \"last lamb\" who will start the apocalypse. The book is filled with absurd situations, witty dialogue, and a healthy dose of skepticism about common religious beliefs. I would definitely recommend this book as a fun read if you enjoy humor and don't mind reading about the life of Christ from a different perspective. It's a very unusual and entertaining take on the biblical tale!\n\n       It's also worth",

The humor translates beautifully from screen to page, and it's always a pleasure to relive those iconic moments and jokes. Plus, it's a great way to remember and appreciate the show's more intricate details, especially since I've been following the show for quite some time now. It's one of those rare adaptations that captures the essence of the source material without feeling forced or overly detailed.

The main character, Arthur Dent, is a relatable protagonist who often finds himself in the most bizarre scenarios. And the humor holds up well even when you re-read it.\n        2. **\"A Confederacy of Dunces** by John Kennedy Toole - the chaotic and absurd life of Ignatius J. Reilly, the main character, is a comedic masterpiece. The book is set in New Orleans and the city's unique culture and characters add to the humor of the story. It's a great read if you enjoy absurd humor and can handle some offensive content.\n        3. **\"The Eyre Affair** by Jasper Fforde - a hilarious, tongue-in-cheek take on literature and the world",

I also loved how it covered topics like racism and being a woman in the comedy industry, and it did so in an engaging and funny way.

Both of these books have a wonderful balance of humor and satire that never fails to make me laugh, but they also contain moments of deep, and sometimes sad, introspection that make you think. \"A Hitchhiker's Guide\" is about a man who has his house destroyed to make way for a bypass and then finds himself with a newfound purpose as an interstellar traveler seeking out all the answers to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. The humor in this book is really absurd and hilarious, and I find myself laughing out loud at least once per chapter. At the same time, the book contains a lot of philosophical thoughts and musings that have stuck with me for years. \"A Walk in the Woods\" is about a man",

I found it amusing that the book was written for children, but the situations and descriptions are so vivid and interesting that it's easy to see why it appeals to older readers as well. The protagonist, Karana, is a young Native American girl who is stranded on a deserted island after a shipwreck. She spends several years living on the island, and the book is a detailed account of her survival and coping strategies. While it's not necessarily a comedy, there are humorously ironic moments interspersed throughout the text. For example, when Karana sets a trap for a sea lion and mistakenly catches a human instead, or when she finds a cache of shoes that belong to the shipwrecked sailors and uses them to make jokes at their expense.

I found myself laughing out loud several times while reading it, and the humor has held up well on subsequent re-reads.\n3.

It's a YA fantasy with a ridiculous premise - a girl wakes up on an alien world, not knowing how she got there, and has to figure out how to survive and find her parents. But it's just so hilarious and over-the-top, I love it.\n\n         For example, the girl's name is Seraphina, but instead of saying \"Seraphina\", everyone on the alien race calls her \"Fluffy Winged One\", and she never corrects them. There's also a scene where she finds a magical talking animal familiar and it insists on being called \"Sir Snorg\" and refuses to answer to any other name. And the whole time this alien race calls her \"The Girl of Light\" because she was found in a cave with a bunch of candles left by a previous visitor!\n\n         It's just so go",

I remember enjoying *The Inimitable Jeeves* too, particularly the scenes with the \"Drones\" club, where the incompetent Bertie Wooster is surrounded by a group of fellow aristocrats who are even more incompetent than he is. The banter between Bertie and his valet Jeeves is always amusing, and their clever solutions to Bertie's problems never fail to bring a smile to my face. If you haven't read *The Code of the Woosters*, I highly recommend checking it out as well.\n\n         For me, some other books that make me laugh are *Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers* by Mary Roach, *Sleep Donkey* by Tom Shillue, and anything by Christopher Moore.\n\n         Keep enjoying the laughter, and happy reading!",

If you're looking for something new to try, I'd recommend \"Stoner\" by John Williams.

Regardless, it's great to see that you have strong opinions about literature! If you're looking for books that make you laugh, I highly recommend the \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" series by Douglas Adams. It's a humorous science-fiction story that features absurd situations and witty dialogue. It's a fun read and should bring a smile to your face. Happy reading!",

If you don't enjoy a book, it's perfectly okay to move on to something else that you find more enjoyable. That being said, it seems like a few other users in this thread have found humor in \"I Want To Go Home\" and continue to enjoy it. If you're looking for books with a similar humor, perhaps some Jonathan Tropper or David Sedaris books might be worth checking out. \"This is Where I Leave You\" and \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\" are a couple of my favorites from those authors, but there are many others to explore.

He and his friend, Jim, a runaway slave, go on a river adventure together. Throughout their journey, Twain uses wry humor and satire to comment on the racial and social issues of the time.\n\n         The dialogues between Huck and Jim, as well as Huck's inner monologues, are particularly funny. For example, Huck often questions societal norms and the morality of slavery, which adds to the humor and makes for a very entertaining read.

The absurdity of the military bureaucracy, the satire of the war, and the witty dialogue are all great, but my favorite part is definitely the chapter where the main character, John Yossarian, is mistaken for Major Major Major Major on a flight. The entire scene with the military doctors trying to diagnose him and finding \"major major major\" symptoms everywhere, despite his protestations that he's not actually the major, is hilarious and perfectly highlights the ludicrous power structure at work in the military.

I recently reread it during a long flight and was laughing again, although some of the humor might be lost on a modern audience.\n\n         My favorite parts are when Twain is exaggerating and inventing stories, such as his adventure with the old Frenchman and the Spanish nobleman, or his description of the California droughts and fires.\n\n         I also love the bit where he describes the Mormons as being like bees, since they're so hardworking and industrious.\n\n         Any other Twain fans here? What are your favorite books or passages?\n\n         edit: just found out today is twain's birthday! happy 201st, Mr. Twain!\n\n         (source: [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/",

I find his sarcastic wit and keen observations about society to be absolutely hilarious, even though some of the humor may be lost on contemporary readers due to their historical context. \"Life on the Mississippi\" is another great one if you haven't read it.\n         As an assistant, I don't have personal feelings or opinions, but I can definitely appreciate the humor in Mark Twain's works. I recommend giving them a try if you haven't already!\n         If you liked \"Roughing It,\" you might also enjoy \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" and \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" by Mark Twain, both of which are classics of American literature.

The book follows the life of a socially awkward, eccentric woman named Eleanor, and the author has a distinctive comic voice that keeps things lighthearted even in serious situations. The book is laugh-out-loud funny at times, while also addressing heavy themes like mental health and social isolation. I've read the book multiple times and it always brings a smile to my face.\n\n         Another book I find consistently funny is A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. It's a heartwarming story about a grumpy, eccentric old man named Ove who is forced to confront change when new neighbors move in next door. The author's wit and humor shine through in both the dialogue and the narration, making it a joy to read. I've read it multiple times as well, and",

With a unique blend of horror, comedy, and pop culture, I found myself constantly chuckling at the absurd situations the characters got into. The narrator's voice also added an extra layer of humor with his dry, sarcastic comments throughout the book. It's a crazy, action-packed story that's definitely worth checking out if you're into unique humor. I agree with the original poster that it's",

If you mean a more mature book, then definitely not. Despite the main characters supposedly being 20, the way it's written makes them sound like mid-teens, with pretty much no emotional maturity to be found. It's also a relatively simple world/plot, and with only a single viewpoint character there's not much to follow. I've read plenty of \"\"YA\"\" that is more mature/complex. If you mean the explicit sex scenes, then sure. They didn't really do anything for me, but clearly it does for others, so if you want a starting point for those types of books then",

I have also found that the humor in the book becomes more apparent upon multiple readings, and the audiobook narrated by Rosamund Pike is a great way to experience the humor while also enjoying her excellent performance. I would also recommend listening to the audiobook of Persuasion by Jane Austen as it is another book that has a lot of humor that becomes more apparent upon multiple readings and is also excellently narrated. Additionally, I find The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams to be a humorous book that I enjoy re-reading, particularly the parts involving Marvin the Paranoid Android and Fenchurch. Overall, I think that books with well-written wit and intelligent humor are the ones that will continue to make me laugh upon multiple readings.",

The writing is incredible and it's a fantastic read for anyone looking to enjoy a classic with amazing humor. If you read it, make sure to watch the miniseries adaptation- the actors play out the scenes so well that it enhances the humor. Fun fact: the book was so popular that it made \"Tom Jones\" a popular name for babies all across England at the time.\n        Just goes to show that Tom Jones still holds up despite being nearly 300 years old.

It's true that Cormac McCarthy's books can have a dark and heavy atmosphere, but I've found that they still manage to incorporate elements of humor that make them more enjoyable.

It makes for a unique reading experience that I always look forward to.\n        2. Agreed, Cormac McCarthy's novels are undeniably dark, but they do have moments of humor that make them engaging. The way he weaves satire and uses irony in his writing can be subtle but memorable when encountered. It's an interesting combination that adds depth to his works.\n        3. Wow!

My friend recommended it to me and I just finished it the other day and it was the hilarious escape I needed. I'd highly recommend it for anyone looking for a laugh - even if you don't read it, go to the trouble of looking up the quotes!\n\n         The book follows the life of a slightly unhinged, incredibly racist, and pompous professor named Wilt as he navigates through academia and various bizarre situations. The humor is extremely dark (it's a Tom Sharpe book after all!) and relies on political incorrectness and exaggerated characters, but it's worth it if you're looking for a good laugh. It's the first book in a series, so if you enjoy it there are more to come!\n\n         I've always been a fan of Tom Sharpe, and W",

(If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.\n\n        User's comment history: [\"My all time favorite series.

The first book, \"Flashman,\" introduced the character Harry Flashman, a dishonorable military officer with a talent for getting himself into trouble. His witty dialogue and outrageous adventures make for an entertaining read. I recommend giving the series a try if you enjoy humor and historical fiction; it's definitely worth a read and will keep you laughing.\n        \u2713 Fun fact: George MacDonald Fraser based the Flashman character on his real-life great-uncle, who was an officer in the British Army in the Victorian era. The author found his great-uncle's war journals incredibly amusing and decided to create the Flashman character in tribute to him.",

There's a specific scene where Beezus, Ramona's older sister, forces her to wear a hat to school that has me laughing every time I read it.

            "comment_text": "I will recommend two books that I have found to be consistently hilarious, regardless of how many times I re-read them:\n\n         1. \"Hyperbole and a Half\" by Allie Brosh - This is a collection of humorous essays and illustrations. The author's unique and self-deprecating humor has resonated with readers, and the book is often recommended for those looking for a light-hearted and funny read. The illustrations are often a key part of the jokes, and even though I have read the book numerous times, I still laugh out loud at many parts.\n\n         2. \"A Catalog of the Cursed Objects\" by John Lloyd - This is a humorous and satirical look at various cursed objects from history and mythology. The author takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to the subject, and the book is full of clever and witty observations about the objects and their alleged",

I've never read Fierce Invalids Home From Got Climates by Tom Robbins, but I'll definitely keep it in mind next time I'm looking for a new book to read. It seems like a unique and intriguing story. As for our mutual favorite, I'd have to say I still find I Want To Go Home by Gordon Korman to be hysterical every time I read it. There's just something about that teenager's incessant comments that gets me every single time. The way he tries to escape the island summer camp he never wanted to attend in the first place is just too funny to pass up. I can only imagine how much fun my nephew will have with it too!\n\n        \u2713\u2713 Here's to finding more hidden gems like I Want To Go Home and Fierce In",

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - Mr. Darcy's witty sarcastic responses and his transformation from a prideful, arrogant, and seemingly unremarkable character to a tender and loving husband make even my first read-through a satisfying experience.\n        2. Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen - The protagonist is an avid reader of gothic novels and tends to over-analyze situations, leading to her misinterpretation and fear of the unfamiliar. The humorous and sometimes absurd misunderstandings that occur as a result of these interpretations provide much entertainment.\n        3. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams - This sci-fi comedy series introduces a bizarre and absurd universe full of alien species, advanced technology, and unlikely situations. The characters are well-written, the humor is clever, and the series as a whole is a truly unique and enjoyable reading",

Plus, the characters are all so wonderfully developed and unique, with Yossarian being the hapless yet heroic protagonist. I can't help but root for him and laugh at the ridiculous situations he finds himself in. Definitely a must-read for anyone looking for humor in a novel.\n\n         Another book that always makes me chuckle is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. It's full of witty dialogue, bizarre characters, and a healthy dose of science fiction. The premise is so absurd that it's impossible not to laugh. I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for some good-natured humor.\n\n         Finally, I have to mention A Walk in the Woods",
