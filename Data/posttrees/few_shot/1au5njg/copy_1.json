I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

Imagine you are the author of a humorous book that readers have repeatedly enjoyed since its publication, bringing laughter and joy to their lives. You have re-read it many times, and it still provides the same level of amusement each time.\n        2. Now, think about the main character in the book you mentioned, a teenager who is trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend. This character's incessant comments are a source of laughter for readers.\n        3. Consider how the author creates this humor, perhaps through witty dialogue, sarcastic remarks, or unexpected plot twist.\n        4. Reflect on the impact that this character and the book as a whole have had on the readers' lives, bringing laughter and joy to their day, and potentially even influencing their outlook on life.\n\n        5. Now, consider the possible reasons for the enduring popularity of",

I completely understand where you're coming from, and that's definitely a good point.\n\n            For the record, I'd also like to add that while Pratchett's novels are always a good choice for a laugh, there are also plenty of others that fit the bill. Some of my favorites include Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" series, Terry Brook's \"The Shannara Chronicles\", and George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" (specifically the second and fourth books, \"A Clash of Kings\" and \"A Feast for Crows\"). Each of these series has its own unique blend of humor, wit, and satire that make them consistently entertaining reads, even when the stakes are high. But ultimately, I think the most important thing is to find a book that speaks to you personally and makes",

Robert Asprin's \"MythAdventures\" series is another fantastic read that never fails to make me chuckle. The witty dialogue and clever characters make for a hilarious adventure every time. My personal favorite is \"Greying of Phrase,\" but I suggest starting with \"A Wasted Year\" to get a sense of the series.\n        3. You're on the right track! Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" series is also a favorite of mine that I return to whenever",

It's a mystery novel where a bunch of different characters all inherit a large estate, and they have to solve a series of clues to figure out who gets it. It's filled with wacky characters, ridiculous problems, and lots of humor. Plus, there are letters and documents and random objects that constantly have hidden meanings, so it's great for the reader to try and figure them out alongside the characters. I haven't read it in forever, but I'll probably pick it up again soon just for the laughs.\n        Other books that make me laugh include A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket, Dork Diaries by Rachel Ren\u00e9e Russell, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.\n        Hope you find a book that makes you laugh as much as these do for me!",

I've listened to \"Engulfed in Flames\" in the car with the windows down, just barely getting my work done while listening and laughing to myself. The guy who narrates the audiobook does an excellent job, too - so good I think he's actually Sedaris in disguise. :p I'd also recommend Andy Borowitz's \"The Borowitz Report\" collection - it's like getting a weekly dose of satire directly from a modern-day Mark Twain.",

When You Are Engulfed in Flames is my personal favorite, but Me Talk Pretty One Day and Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls are also excellent choices. Definitely check him out if you haven't already!\n         I also find that some books are just funnier when I listen to the audiobook version, especially if the author has a distinctive voice or style of reading. The Princess Bride by William Goldman is one of my all-time favorite books, and the audiobook is especially hilarious because Goldman reads it himself and really brings the characters to life.

It's a satire about the hedonistic British upper class, and the main character, Nicholas, is a struggling writer who finds himself in a series of absurd and humorous situations. I find his inner monologues particularly funny, as he struggles to maintain a veneer of sophistication while constantly being pushed past his limits. This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys clever writing and a good laugh! I can see why it made you smile the first time you read it and still does when you re-read it.*",

Clocktaur Wars duology by Kingfisher is another great example of a funny and imaginative audiobook series. The narrator brings the characters to life and the humor is well-timed. I've also found that Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Catch-22 are hilarious and definitely worth a listen.

To answer your question, the user is 50 years old and first read \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" when they were 16-17.

This suggests that their experience with the book may have been influenced by their age at the time of reading, and that re-reading it as a middle-aged adult may have led to a different response. It's interesting to note that despite the user's initial disappointment, they still hold the book in high regard enough to still love it, suggesting that even if their impression of the book has changed, their overall enjoyment of it remains.

When I first read it, I thought it was funny and entertaining, but after reading many other books with more humor and clever writing, RPO doesn't hold up as well. It's likely that I would have enjoyed it more if I had read it at a younger age, but reading it now as an adult, it just doesn't have the same appeal as it once did.\n         It's also worth noting that humor is subjective and what one person finds hilarious, another person might not find funny at all. It's possible that RPO was highly amusing to a lot of people when it first came out, but as time went on and more books were written with more sophisticated and subtle humor, RPO simply didn't measure up as",

It's the story of a socially awkward geneticist who decides to embark on a project to find a wife, and the unexpected turns his life takes as a result.\n        3. Another favorite of mine is Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - it's a classic, but the witty banter and sharp social commentary still hold up today, and make for a great read with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.\n        4.

They're murder mysteries set in the 1950s and featuring a clever and snarky young woman named Flavia de Luce. I especially enjoy the way Bradley blends the seriousness of the murder plot with Flavia's lighthearted and sometimes quirky observations.\n\n        3. Another series that never fails to make me laugh is the Cozy Caprice mysteries by H.Y. Hanna.

There are many readers who find Nick to be unlikable, and some even go as far as to say that they dislike him with a passion. However, it's worth noting that the book was well-received by many critics and readers despite Nick's flaws, due in part to its sharp wit, unique plot, and compelling mystery. It's a matter of personal taste, and if you didn't enjoy \"Gone Girl\", it's perfectly acceptable to move on to other books. If you're looking for a book with a similarly dark and twisty plot, you might enjoy \"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins, which has also been a popular choice among readers.",

For me, I have to disagree with the post's title for the book \"I Want To Go Home\" by Gordon Korman. While it's a fun, entertaining read, I personally didn't find it made me laugh continually throughout and it doesn't make me laugh now when I re-read it. However, I can understand why some people find it so amusing, and I appreciate the author's creativity and ability to entertain readers. But in my opinion, I'd like to suggest a different book for readers looking for laughter: \"A Confederacy of Dunces\" by John Kennedy Toole. I find this book incredibly hilarious from start to finish, and the main character's absurdity and eccentricity never cease to amuse me. I read it several years ago, but it's one I'll definitely re-read in",

The absurd situations and characters are made all the more hilarious by the backdrop of the bustling, eccentric city.\n\n         Another book that comes to mind that makes me laugh every time I read it is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.

Agreed - maybe the book just isn't quite right for the big screen? Some ideas translate well, while others get lost in translation.\n        3. If you need a good laugh while stuck in isolation, I'd recommend Stephen King's \"The Dark Tower\" series (though caution: it's the opposite of light-hearted). I laughed out loud during some parts, while others may find it inappropriate or off-putting. All in all, it's a great story. Maybe try reading \"Wizard and Glass\" for a standalone laugh!",

The author, Paul Beatty, masterfully explores the absurdity and inconsistencies of America's racial dynamics.\n        3.

Celine's work is a prime example of this, and Journey to the End of the Night is a masterpiece of absurdity. The protagonist, Ferdinand, is a hopeless and lost narrator who spins a tale that is both entertaining and tragic, making for a unique and unforgettable reading experience.

The situations the characters find themselves in are just absurd and ridiculous, but in a way that is so perfectly written that it's hard not to laugh at them. I often recommend it to friends because it's such a great read, and I'm always happy to discuss it with them afterwards and reminisce about our favorite moments. I've read it multiple times now, and I still find myself chuckling to myself whenever I think about it.\n\n         Here's an example of the type of humor you might find in the book:\n\n         \"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that everyone else is ignoring was proof of insanity.\"\n\n         Or this, which describes",

I find her situation relatable and I love her witty and self-deprecating comments.\n\n        \u00a0 \u00a0The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson - lots of quirky and absurd situations that are humorous and entertaining.",

I love how absurd and over-the-top the medicine ingredients are, and the chaos that ensues afterwards.\n        2. Another one that always makes me chuckle is \"The Wind in the Willows\" by Kenneth Grahame. It follows Mr. Toad and his friends as they go on various adventures, and the characters' quirks and speech patterns are classic and amusing.\n        3. If you're looking for a more recent book that will make you laugh, I highly recommend \"The Rosie Project\" by Graeme Simsion. It is a contemporary romance about a socially awkward professor",

One of the series that I find hilarious is Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books. The main character is a bounty hunter and I find the situations she gets herself into just ridiculous and funny. I've read all the books in the series several times and they still make me laugh.\n        3. Another series that I enjoy for its humor is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. It's a sci-fi book that incorporates a lot of satire and sarcasm into the story. The main character, Arthur Dent, goes on a cosmic adventure with a group of aliens after Earth is destroyed.

I was first introduced to it in middle school and it has remained a constant source of entertainment throughout my life, even going so far as to listen to the audiobooks while driving alone. The humor is absurd and yet perfectly timed, and the characters are unique and incredibly endearing. Even when the series gets a little dark or philosophical, the levity is kept firmly in place thanks to Adams' wit and charm. I can't even begin to count the number of times I've found myself bursting out in laughter while reading it, and I honestly don't think I'll ever get tired of it.

The dry humour and the absurdity of the characters, particularly Aunt Ada Doom, still never fails to make me laugh.

If anyone else has any books that give them a similar kind of joy, I'd love to hear about them!",

This novel is a humorous and sprawling tale of Ignatius J. Reilly, a 30-year-old self-proclaimed Renaissance man, living with his mother in New Orleans in the 1960s. Ignatius's bizarre ideas, unusual interactions with others, and general inability to fit in with society make for a humorous and unforgettable read.\n        3",

The humor comes from his perspective and his unique way of dealing with life's curveballs.

Klune's books, but based on my familiarity with this user's comment history, I can confidently say that they would find Klune's books to be humorously entertaining, probably with some unexpected poignant moments thrown in, leading to a mix of laughter, emotion, and introspection. Given their previous reading recommendations of witty and whimsical books, such as The Martian and Psalm for the Wild-Built, Klune's books would likely fit well with their reading tastes.

I had read the whole series, but the first book in particular has some scenes that had me laughing. One example is when Meggie and Dustfinger are running away from the fire demon, and Dustfinger, in his desperation, accidentally casts a spell that turns them into chickens. It had been a while since I've read it, but the scene still stands out in my mind as being very funny.\n\n        Additionally, I still find the character of Dustfinger to be quite funny, especially when he's interacting with other characters like Elinor and Mo. He has a very dry wit that had me chuckling throughout the book.\n\n        2.\n\n        I laughed a lot when I read The Princess Bride.
