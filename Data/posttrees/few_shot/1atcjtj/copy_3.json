    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

It was about a group of greasers (young males) vs. the wealthy \"socs\" (an acronym for \"socialists\") and the friendship between the two main characters, Ponyboy and Johnny. Johnny dies and he was my first major heartbreak as a reader. It was a tragedy from the get go and it broke my heart as a 5th grader when Johnny died.\n\n        2 - \"Flowers for Algernon\" by Daniel Keyes. The tragic story of a man named Charlie with an intellectual disability, who gets a surgical procedure to raise his IQ to a genius level. The twist at the end is gut wrenching.\n\n        3 - \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak. This book is beautifully written, and I cried at the end, when the main character dies at the end.",

One book that stands out is \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman. The book is about Ove, a stubborn 59-year-old Swedish man who is set in his ways and hates change. However, after the death of his wife, he befriends his new neighbors, a young couple with a toddler, and his perspective on life slowly starts to change.\n\n        2. Another book that made me feel something was \"The Fault in Our Stars\" by John Green. I'm not usually a fan of young adult fiction, but I heard so many good things about this book that I had to give it a try. It's the story of Hazel Grace, a 16-year-old girl with terminal cancer, and Gus, the boy she meets at cancer",

The pain and frustration he feels, as well as the confusion and disappointment he experiences after finding out that he was never actually chosen by God to perform a specific mission, are all so palpable that it made me feel a deep sense of empathy and sorrow for him. I found myself tearing up as I read this scene, and it made me feel like I was experiencing the emotions",

It follows two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who are mysteriously bonded and forced to compete in a deadly game. The story is set at a magical travelling circus that comes to life at night and it's filled with beautiful descriptions and breathtaking imagery. The competition between them is heartbreaking and the twist at the end left me in tears. I've reread this book multiple times and it never fails to move me.\"",

I cried at the end, as the author had intended. \"The Giving Tree\" was also a tear-jerking read, and was particularly emotional for me because I really connected with the tree's selfless love for the boy. The more I age, the more sentimental these books become to me, and I reread both of them from time to time. I'm glad we both shared similar emotions with these wonderful books.\n\n         Here'",

That whole book was heartbreaking, but the ending with the dog dying was particularly rough.

Not only was the writing beautifully descriptive, but there was an unexpected twist that hit me like a gut punch. That book made me cry like no other book before it.\n\n         And even though he's a dog, I still can't forget Old Yeller after all these years. That book was a classic for a reason.",

It was in the scene where Eleanor takes off her clothes to clean herself in their shed, and Park sees her for the first time as she truly is. The way he describes her, the vulnerability, her loneliness, the longing to be loved, all of it hit me in my feels. It wasn't just the sadness or the raw emotion, but the beauty and the human-ness of it all that moved me. Plus, I could identify with both Eleanor and Park on some level, I think, which made the scene even more impactful for me.",

It's considered a classic in the genre of military fiction, and the story is based on the accounts of ancient historians like Herodotus and Xenophon.

The whole book was beautiful and romantic, but the unexpected death at the end really got to me.

It also left me with a lot of questions that I was never able to find answers to, because I knew that there would probably never be a sequel.\n\n         I recommend this book to anyone who loves magical realism and a bit of romance, but be prepared to have your heart broken when you get to the end.\n\n         (spoilers ahead) >!In \"The Night Circus,\" two young magicians, Celia and Marco, have been raised in secret to compete in a magical challenge set up by their mentors.

It's a thrilling adventure with unforgettable characters, great pacing, and a unique world-building that spans both our world and the 'Deadlands'.

The final book, \"The King Beyond The Gate\" is definitely the best of the series, and it provides a satisfying conclusion to the series as a while, tying up many of the loose ends and the various subplots. It's definitely worth reading if you enjoyed the first book. Of course, the rest of the series is still a bit hit-or-miss, but if you're invested in the characters then you'll likely enjoy it. As for the second and third books (both titled \"Waylander\"), I found them a bit slow and less engaging, but the final book definitely makes up for any shortcomings earlier on in the series. If you do decide to read the series again, I'd definitely recommend reading \"The King Beyond The Gate\" last, as it provides a fitting conclusion and ties together many of the threads established earlier in the",

The main character, Ove, is a grumpy and rigid old man who has lost his wife and is struggling with his new neighbors, who are a young family with two children. The book follows Ove as he goes about his daily routine, which involves a lot of reminiscing about his past and his wife, and also dealing with the challenges of modern society, such as recycling and neighborhood squabbles.\n\n        The book is full of humor and heart, and I teared up multiple times while reading it. One scene in particular that comes to mind is when Ove is struggling to fix a bike for one of the children in the family, and starts to remember his own children and how he used to fix their bikes for them when they were younger. The way the author writes this scene, and the way Ove's thoughts and memories twist",

The emotional impact of books can be so powerful, and it's heartwarming to hear that you shared that experience with your mom. Losing a loved one, especially at a young age, can be traumatic, and it's beautiful that this book was able to convey that loss in a way that touched you both. I'm glad you could find comfort in shared mourning. I'd be curious to know if there were any other books that had a similar impact on you and your relationship. Perhaps it's a tradition you can carry on in the future, discovering and sharing emotional books together. \ud83d\ude0a<br>\n\n        Additionally, I wanted to comment on something you mentioned in your comment history about books and their representation.

There are several moments in the book that made me cry, but one of the most memorable is when the main character, Meggie, loses her first love in a tragic accident. The description of her grief and the aftermath of the tragedy is powerful and emotional.

Lyra and Will's journey together, and the sacrifice Will makes for Lyra, was so emotional that I remember putting the book down multiple times and having to walk away for a bit to gather myself before continuing. The scenes in the underworld where they say goodbye and then Will ascends to heaven were particularly hard to read. It's a beautiful and poignant ending to the trilogy and it really hit me hard as a kid.\n\n         Since then I've come to appreciate their relationship even more as I've grown, and I think it's a unique and powerful example of platonic love. The themes of self-sacrifice, loyalty, and friendship are portrayed so well in the book, and it's always been one of my favorite stories. I rere",

With so many great ones available, it\u2019s hard to pick just one, but if I had to, I\u2019d say the series that comes to mind first is Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nFrom the moment I picked up Throne of Glass, I was completely hooked on the world Maas crafted, and the characters she developed. The magic system is unique, the politics are complex, and the characters are diverse and well-written. It was refreshing to find a female protagonist who wasn\u2019t shy about taking charge and kicking ass.\n\nWhile there are certainly other strong female-centric fantasy series out there, Throne of Glass",

What's interesting is that this scene didn't have nearly as much emotional impact for me when I first read the book as a child, but it certainly did when I revisited the series as an adult.

It's a beautiful and heart-wrenching story about a young boy who is struggling with his mother's terminal illness. The monster in the story is a metaphor for the emotions and thoughts that the boy is dealing with during this difficult time. The book is filled with moments that will make you feel deeply for the characters, and the ending is incredibly powerful. I highly recommend it.\n         For the record, even though I haven't read the book, I can understand why Walk Two Moons would be emotial. It sounds like a powerful story, and the ending is a revelation which can be extremely emotional. I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed the book! If you haven'",

The book is told through Sal's narration, as well as excerpts from a journal that her grandmother, Phoebe, wrote. Towards the end of the book, it is revealed that Sal's mother has been dead for a year, and that Sal had known this whole time but had hidden it from her aunt and grandmother. This revelation, along with the emotional journey that Sal goes on to come to terms with her mother's death, was incredibly powerful and left me feeling very emotional. I remember rereading this book multiple times and always tearing up at the end. It is definitely one of my favorite books and one that I will always remember.",

The scene was particularly poignant because the reader knows that Eddard was innocent, making it even more unjust and upsetting.

I remember that feeling of tears running down your face from reading, and I miss that as an adult. My emotional moments from reading as a kid would generally come from the Redwall series by Brian Jacques. There were so many moments where you could just feel the characters' pain, and one of the first times I experienced that was at the end of Martin the Warrior. The death of an animal friend is always a tough read, and Rose's death was no exception. The way it happened, and how Martin takes her passing to heart, was just incredibly moving. Even now, all these years later, I can still feel the sadness and loneliness he felt in that moment.\n\n         If you haven't yet, I'd definitely recommend giving the Redwall series a try.

It was the first book I read that made me feel such a deep emotional connection to a story and characters.\n\n         For another example, the closing scene of To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee really got to me, as Scout understands the true meaning of empathy and compassion for others. It was powerful to see such growth and understanding in Scout's character and it left me feeling hopeful and inspired.\n\n         Another book that brought me to tears was \"The Night Circus\" by Erin Morgenstern. The relationship between the two main characters, Cel",

The book was difficult and emotional to read as I was growing up and learning about the consequences of actions, and it was even more so because I had been physically and emotionally abused by a neighbor. Reading about Davie's experiences, some of which I could relate to, and learning about his resilience and desire to survive, was incredibly important and impactful for me at that age.\n\n         I remember reading the book for a class assignment, but even after that, I took the time to read it again later.

The story is about a man with an intellectual disability who undergoes a series of experiments to try to increase his intelligence. The book is written in a diary format, with the entries getting shorter and less coherent as the character's intelligence starts to decline. It's a heartbreaking look at the way society treats people with disabilities, and the way the character's own self-worth and confidence plummets as he realizes that the intelligence he gained was temporary.\n\n        I didn't actually cry while reading it, but I was definitely tearful by the end, and I found myself feeling very emotional for days afterwards. It's a powerful and moving story, and one that I think everyone should read.",

The story follows an intellectually impaired man named Charlie who becomes the subject of an experimental procedure meant to increase his IQ to that of a normal person. As the procedure works, the book is written in reverse chronological order and follows Charlie's deterioration as his intelligence gradually returns to its original level. The emotions triggered by this book for me were a mix of sadness, frustration, and a certain nostalgia for the simple and innocent life that Charlie had before the procedure. The knowledge that his intellect would only continue to decline, along with the loss of the relationships he had built, was heartbreaking. Additionally, the way the story is written, with the use of reverse chronology, emphasizes the rapid and inevitable nature of Charlie's decline, making the tragedy all the more devastating.

Firstly, the narrator was Death, which already made it unlike any book I'd read before. Secondly, the story and the characters were so well-written that I felt a deep connection to them, and that combined with the looming sense of Hitler's reign and the Nazi's persecution of Jews made the story all the more powerful. It was a deeply emotional and impactful read for me, and still one of my favorites to this day.\n\n        (TL;DR: The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a powerful and emotional book about a girl named Liesel who is raised by foster parents in Nazi Germany.

The story is also incredibly powerful and important, as it tells the story of two Afghan women living under terrible circumstances and the struggles they face. The book was also very well-written, making it even more impactful. The ending was particularly heart-wrenching for me.",

The book follows the story of a young girl who ends up in Nazi Germany as a foster child. The story is told from the perspective of Death, who watches as the girl's life unfolds. The ending, in which Death visits the girl in her final moments, really shook me. It made me cry my eyes out.\n\n         The second book is \"Call Me by Your Name\" by Andre Aciman. The book tells the story of a young man who falls in love with a visitor to his family's Italian villa during the summer. The ending, in which the two lovers are separated, is heartbreaking. Both books are incredibly beautiful and well-written, and I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reading experience that will leave them emotionally drained.\n\n          For",

The main characters are Ponyboy and Johnny, two brothers in age, but not by blood. Johnny is more of a leader of the group and Ponyboy is a bit of a bookworm. Throughout the story, the boys are in a constant fight with the Socs and eventually things escalate into violence when Johnny kills a Soc in self-defense. The police pick him up and Johnny realizes his fate because he is an underage murderer. The boys get together and plan to have an alibi for Johnny to the police. They do, but on their way",

However, she never loses her spirit or hope and eventually finds a way to regain her status and live happily ever after.\n\n         The scene that made me cry was the one where Sara is sitting alone in her room, eating her last piece of bread and crying.

Towards the end of the book, the main character's dream spirit-animal, the red bird, gets lost and the reader is left wondering whether it will be found again or not. The book ends with the main character and her friends finding the lost spirit-animal but instead of being happy and reunited, the main character is left with a sense of regret and a desire to continue her journey in life. It was so emotional and heart-wrenching for me because I was left with a feeling of unresolved sadness and longing. It wasn't a sad ending per se, but it was bittersweet and left me with a new appreciation for the cycle of life and the journey that one must take to find their own happiness.\n         The book \"Wolf by Wolf\" by Ryan Graudin also left me feeling incredibly emotional.

I loved the dynamics between the characters and how they all had to navigate their secret identities and the consequences of having more than two children. I remember being particularly scared that something like that could happen to me and my siblings, but it helped me appreciate the importance of family and love even more.\n         It's funny how a book can stick with you and inspire you for years to come. Reading Among the Hidden gave me a new appreciation for the freedom and rights I have as a person and ignited a passion for books that I hold to this day. It's always amazing what stories can teach us about the world and the people in it.\n         Keep reading and enjoying the stories, my friend!",

They're all pretty good and a must-read for anyone who enjoyed the first book.\n\n         For those who haven't read it yet, the \"Hidden\" series tells the story of Luke Garner, a third child secretly born in a society where the government allows couples to have only two children. Luke and his older siblings are raised without the knowledge that they are breaking the law, and the series follows them as they must deal with the consequences and challenges of their existence.

The book is called \"Outlander\" and the protagonist, Claire Randall, is a WWII nurse who is stationed in Scotland for the war. On her second honeymoon with her husband Frank, she is magically transported back in time to 1743 Scotland. She falls in love with the handsome and charismatic Jamie Fraser, who is a Scottish Highlander, but is torn between her duty to her husband and her love for Jamie. The climax of the book is when Claire must make a choice - go back to Frank and her time, or stay with Jamie. This choice is made even more poignant because Jamie has been badly injured and Claire cannot leave him in that state. I cried for a good hour after I finished that book.

The book perfectly encapsulates the tumultuous and chaotic emotions that come with the terrifying prospect of death, and it does so in a beautiful and heartbreaking way. The main characters' love story was bittersweet and tragic, and my heart ached as I read about their adventures and their love growing stronger and stronger. I was left in tears at the end, and the book still resonates with me to this day. I think if you haven't already read it, you should definitely give it a try.

The book follows a girl, Liesel, who is learning to read and find solace in books during the Holocaust. Rudy is one of her best friends, and their bond is very strong. The death of Rudy is not only devastating because of the loss of someone dear, but also because he was such a positive force in the story - a bright light in a very dark time.\n\n        \tI think what made the scene particularly emotional is that it highlights the fragility of life and the inevitability of loss, especially during a time when it was so grim.

The main character, Sara Crewe, is a rich girl who is sent to a boarding school after her father dies. She quickly falls on hard times and is treated very poorly by the headmistress, Miss Minchin. In one particularly heart-wrenching scene, Sara is reduced to living on scraps of food and begging for money on the street. Despite everything she's gone through, Sara remains hopeful and kind-hearted and never gives up on the belief that she will one day return to her privileged life. The ending is just so uplifting and wonderful. I read this book when I was in elementary school and I still think about it often.",

            "comment_text": "For me, it was the book \"A Little Life\" by Hanya Yanagihara. The story follows four friends from college, but the main character is Jude, a man who has endured unspeakable abuse and trauma throughout his life. The book explores themes of abuse, sexuality, mental health, and friendship, and it was the first book that made me feel truly emotionally invested in a character. I found myself sobbing multiple times throughout the book, and the ending left me feeling emotionally drained but also satisfied. It's a difficult read, but it's one of the most impactful books I've ever read.",

It's a story about a woman named Nora who, after dying and finding herself in a metaphysical library, decides to try out different lives and make different choices that she regrets in her past. Ultimately, she must come to terms with her own life and make peace with the decisions she's made. The book is deeply introspective and has a poignant ending that I find myself thinking about often. It's not a book that made me cry while reading, but it did make me feel very introspective and emotional afterwards. It is a book that I would highly recommend to anyone going through a difficult time, as it is a reminder that we all make mistakes in life, but we have the power to choose again.\n\n        Another book that I found extremely emotional and impactful is *The Night Circus* by Erin Morgen",

I couldn't believe they were going to leave him like that after I spent so many days reading about his struggles with the Dursleys and trying to stay under the radar at Hogwarts. It felt like everything was falling apart and I was super anxious about what was going to happen.\n\n2. The Night Circus: This one almost made me cry again as an adult.

The story follows 59-year-old Ove, a grumpy seemingly miserable old man, who has just lost his wife and is suffering from depression. The protagonist is shown to be irritable and unfriendly, but throughout the novel, we see glimpses of the man he once was, as well as the man he is now, and how he is slowly rebuilding himself through the interactions he has with his new neighbors.\n\n         I found myself getting incredibly invested in Ove's story and his relationships with the other characters in the book, and by the end of the story, I was completely heartsick. The beauty of the story lies not just in its characters, but in the way they change and grow throughout the story. The story is a sweet reminder of how life can truly be enriched through the connections we make with others. It is",

Their love and devotion to each other, along with the tragic circumstances that unfold, really hit me on a deeper level. It's a beautiful tale and I'm glad you found it impactful in your life.\n\n        3. The book titled \"A Child Called It\" sounds heartbreaking.
