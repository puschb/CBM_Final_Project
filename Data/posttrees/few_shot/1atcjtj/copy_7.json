    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

It's a contemporary novel about a boy named Conor whose mother is terminally ill and dealing with her death. The monster serves as both Conor's outlet for his grief and his confidant as he struggles to deal with his mother's impending death. There was a scene where the mother says goodbye to Conor that really got to me.\n\n2. \"The House on Mango Street\" by Sandra Cisneros - This is a collection of short stories about a young, Mexican-American girl named Esperanza who's living in Chicago. The stories are heartwarming, but there's also a lot of hardship and struggle that Esperanza and her family face. There's a powerful scene where Esperanza",

I don't remember much about the plot, but I remember crying at the ending. It really spoke to me about friendship and loss. Have you read any other books by John Irving? I've heard good things about The Cider House Rules and A Widow for One Year.\n\n         For another book that made me cry, I have to mentioned Me Before You by Jojo Moyes. The story of a man with quadriplegia and his caregiver was so heart-wrenching, I was bawling uncontrollably at the end. I wouldn't recommend it if you're not in the mood for some heavy feelings, but it's definitely a powerful read.\n\n         What about you? Are there any other books that have really moved you emotionally?",

I've found that revisiting some books can be bittersweet as we grow older and see things through a new lens.

But as an adult, reading it again I feel a deep sadness and empathy for Sara and her struggles, especially when she falls ill and is misunderstood by those around her. Even so, the book still retains its magic, and there's something comforting in knowing that even in difficult times, we can find solace in the words on the page.

As I got older I found out why Old Dan limped and it made the book even more emotional. You can certainly relate to the love and bond between Billy and his dogs, and it's heartbreaking when they're no longer there. It's a beautiful story that really highlights the love and connection between man and their pet, and it teaches you valuable life lessons. I'd recommend it to anyone, especially if you have dogs or enjoyed the movie.",

The user's comment history suggests they may not be in the mood for a heartfelt story about a boy and his dogs, so I'll try to address that in my response:\n\n        For me, the first book that made me cry was \"Where the Red Fern Grows.\" I read it as a child and it was just a truly moving story. In the book, a boy named Billy has always wanted a coonhound dog, so his grandfather gives him the money to buy a pair of dogs. He eventually gets two dogs, Old Dan and Little Ann, who become his best friends and help him on hunting trips. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes and one of the dogs is killed. I won't give away the ending, but let's just say it's a bit of a tear-jerker.\n\n        Overall, I think it's a wonderful book that teaches us about loss",

The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern - This book had me emotionally hooked from the very first chapter. It tells the story of two magicians and their circus, which is filled with romance, magic, and danger. The book is beautifully written and the plot is full of twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end.

He finally manages to save up enough money to buy two red bone coonhounds named Old Dan and Little Ann. The dogs become a part of his family and they go on many adventures together.

The bond between Druss and his wife is continued through the rest of the saga, and I think many fans would agree that it's one of the most memorable and heartwarming relationships in the series. I also think the character development of Druss throughout the series is outstanding. He goes from a man in his prime with a fierce thirst for battle, to a war-weary and broken warrior, to the wise and respected commander of the forces of Rigante. The writing style, while somewhat old-fashioned, is very captivating and makes you feel as if you're right there in the action. I'd definitely recommend reading the entire Rigante arc if you haven't already, as it's a true tour-de-force of",

The story follows Conor after his mother is diagnosed with cancer, and it focuses on his struggle to accept the situation, both through dealing with his emotions and bullying at school. Conor's relationship with his mother and his fear of losing her were really touching, and I'd often find myself unable to read for too long at a time because of how emotionally involved I became. Overall, it was a great story about love, loss, and the struggle to come to terms with emotional pain.\n\n         For those interested, I'd highly recommend giving it a try if you haven't already.

I won't give away any spoilers, but there is a part that really got to me and I had to put the book down for a bit.\n\n        Another book that made me shed a few tears was \"The Fault in Our Stars\" by John Green.

I'd recommend rereading that series if you haven't in a while, it's truly a masterpiece.\n\n         Another book that came close to making me cry was The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern.

One of the moments that stands out in my memory is the climax of the eighth book, \"A Crown of Swords.\" It's a particularly action-packed book, and the final battle between the forces of good and evil is a real nail-biter.\n\nBut it's not just the big moments that get to me \u2013 it's",

I'm glad you were able to find that emotional connection with the book. It's moments like that that make reading so special.\n         For me, it was definitely when Atticus and his father die in The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas. The way the violence and intensity builds up throughout the chapters, only to end with those two characters was heartbreaking.

The story of Conor, a young boy dealing with his mother's terminally ill cancer, is heartbreaking and powerful. The illustrations by Jim Kay add an extra layer of emotion to the story and make it even more impactful. The book is a beautiful exploration of loss, grief, and family that I think is a must-read.\n\n         What are some other books that have made you emotional or gotten you choked up",

What book made you cry and why?\n\n         For me, it was \"Walk Two Moons\" by Sharon Creech. It's a YA book about a girl, Sal, who is forced to move away from her grandparents and the only home she knew and loved. The book is divided into three parts, with Sal's story in the present, her grandmother's story in the past, and Phoebe's story, a friend she meets during her grandparents' trip, in the present as well.

Along the way, she meets Phoebe, a girl who tells her the story of her own grandparents and the tragedy that befell them. The two girls become close, and Sal shares her own story with Phoebe.\n\nAt the end of the book, it is revealed that Sal's mother has been in a car accident and is now unable to speak or move.

I've read a few books that have made me cry or get choked up. One of the first ones that comes to mind is the Redwall series by Brian Jacques. There's a character named Martin the Warrior who is so brave and kind, and in the last book of the series, he falls in love and eventually dies. It's a very sad scene and I must have read that series about five times before I could get through that part without tearing up. Another book that made me cry was the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins. The ending is just so heart-wrenching and final.\n\n I must say, though, there are also books that make me laugh and feel happy. One of those is A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry. It's set",

The way the novel ends, with Snowman being driven away, is also pretty heartbreaking.\n         On a separate note, I think it's interesting that you've never had a book make you cry before now. I've found that sometimes we don't realize the emotional impact of a book until it hits us later, once we've had some time to think about it.

The story is heartbreaking yet beautiful, and the ending is one that will stick with you for a long time. The characters are complex and well-developed, and the themes of loss, love, and the power of books are strong. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great story with emotional depth.\n\n         For the rest of the comments, here's an example:\n\n         Comment 1: The first book that made me cry was A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness. It's a beautiful and heartbreaking story about a",

Crime and Punishment, in particular, is a masterpiece that delves into the inner workings of the human psyche and the consequences of guilt and morality.

The protagonist, Charlie, is a man with a lower than average IQ who undergoes a experimental surgery that increases his intelligence. The story is told through a series of diary entries and intelligence test results, and it's clear from the beginning that the surgery is only temporary. As Charlie's intelligence rises, he becomes more and more aware of the limitations of his previous life and the world's reaction to him. Eventually, he realizes that the intelligence increases is only temporary and he will eventually lose it again. The story is incredibly sad because it's evident that Charlie understands his own impending decline, and he is also aware that he never truly fit in with society. The end of the book is particularly crushing because Charlie, after understanding how his intelligence has declined, decides to give up on life and let himself regress back to his former self. The book is",

I can't really remember the exact moment, but I know it had something to do with Charlie's emotional and intellectual realization and growth, and the sadness of his eventual decline. The book really hit me emotionally, and I've always remembered it as one of my favorite reads.\n         Another book that made me cry was \"A Monster Calls\" by Patrick Ness. The depiction of loss, grief, and understanding was incredibly powerful, and helped me understand and process my own feelings about death and loss in a way that I hadn't before. The ending was especially heart-wrenching, and I think about it often.\n         Both of these books had a strong impact on me, and have stayed with me even years after I first read them.\n         Hope you find a book that moves you too!",

I remember being in middle school and reading it for a school assignment, and I completely fell in love with the story and the characters. When Scout's father, Atticus, reads her the letter from the jury that Tom Robinson has been found guilty, despite all the evidence to the contrary, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of sadness and injustice. It really made me think about the state of the world and the treatment of people based on their race. It also made me appreciate the importance of standing up for what is right, even if it is difficult or unpopular. It's a powerful book that I think everyone should read at least once.\n\n        For instance, the following:\n        The post's title: Who should read Jodi Picoult's The Sisters of Heart and Bone first?",

Little did I know, I would be completely and utterly heartbroken by the end. I bawled my eyes out, and it stayed with me for weeks afterwards. The book is a tragic but beautifully written story about a man with a low IQ who undergoes a surgery to increase his intelligence. At first, everything is fantastic for him, but as he gets closer to the \"normal\" level of intelligence, he realizes that the things that made him special are disappearing along with his low intelligence. The ending is one of the most devastatingly sad things I've ever read, and I still think about it today. Highly recommend for any science fiction or tragedy lovers!",

He's a bit of a curmudgeon, but has a softer side that starts to reveal itself as the story progresses.\n\nOne scene in particular that really hit me was when another character, who is a young pregnant woman, is struggling to park her car. Ove, who is watching the whole scene, offers his help. The young woman hesitates at first because of his reputation, but eventually accepts his help. In that moment, I could see the kindness and compassion in Ove's soul that he had hidden beneath his gruff exterior. It was a beautiful moment of connection between two people from",

I was constantly on edge, worrying about what would happen next to the characters I came to care about. I kept rereading the climactic scene over and over again and it still chokes me up to this day.

Lettie is a wise and mysterious old woman who lives in a house at the end of the lane, and the protagonist rekindles his friendship with her as an adult. She helps him confront and overcome his fears and memories of an abusive childhood, and in one particularly moving scene, she stands with him against a monstrous creature that had been terrorizing their village. This scene, along with other moments between the two of them, really showcases the power of friendship and the ability to find solace and courage in others.

The characters are so richly drawn, and the relationship between the protagonists is so complicated and tragic, that I was really invested in it. And the setting - the circus - was magical and whimsical, and I felt like I stepped into another world when I was reading it.\n\nFor a long time after I finished the book, I couldn't stop thinking about it, and it made me want to read more books that were as transportive and immersive as the Night Circus. It was the book that really made me fall in love with the world of literature.\n\n1. The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger.

The story follows two teenage cancer patients, Hazel and Gus, who are brought together through their shared circumstances. Throughout the book, their love story unfolds in a tender and heartbreaking way. One of the most impactful scenes for me was towards the end, when Hazel is talking to her parents over the phone about Gus'",

The scene where Winston was confronted by O'Brien and was told the truth about the Party and Inner Party and the horrible things they had done was the point I started tearing up. I had never read a book that was so hauntingly accurate and it made me feel sick to my stomach to think that the state of the world could really turn out that way.\n\n        2. The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. I don't remember exactly which scene it was, but one particular scene made me feel so much sadness and anger towards the injustices that the characters were suffering in the dystopian society.\n\n        3. A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks. I don't read romance much or at all, but this was one of the only exceptions. The scene where Landon arrives to pick up Jamie after he had been away in the war",

The reader follows Charlie's journey as he goes through the surgery, and the chapters are structured in a way that mirrors Charlie's increasing intelligence. The novel is an emotional rollercoaster and it's heartbreaking to see Charlie's self-awareness and progress come to a halt as his intelligence gradually decreases. It's a raw and powerful novel that really resonated with me. \n\n        For instance, the following:\n        The post's title: What is better: Kindle or Goodreads?\n        The post's",
