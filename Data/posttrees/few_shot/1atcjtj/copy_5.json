    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

It was a beautiful, heartbreaking story that really drove home some of the struggles women face in societies like Afghanistan and really got to me. I had to put the book down several times because I found myself crying and had to take a break. It's definitely one of my favourite books of all time.",

The story is about a young girl, Briony, who lies about a crime and the consequences that follow. The book is split into three parts, and each part follows a different character. The first part is focused on Briony, who is still a child at the time. She is obsessed with writing, and when she overhears her older sister and her lover having an affair, she blames them for a terrible crime that her cousin Robbie had nothing to do with. The second part is about Robbie, who is sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, and the third part is about Cecilia, the lover who is also Briony's best friend. The book is heartbreaking, and I cried throughout the entire second and third parts. The ending is particularly heartbreaking",

It's a historical novel set in the early 20th century, and follows multiple characters' stories intertwined with real historical figures of the time. Near the end of the book, the main character's daughter is kidnapped, and the ending is just devastating. As a father myself, it really hit home for me.\n\n         I've also been moved to tears multiple times while reading Kate Atkinson's \"Life After Life\". It's a novel that follows the same character throughout various iterations of their life. The emotion and heartache in the story is just incredible, and it's a book that I'll never forget.",

But I have to say, I remember being really moved when reading The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. I cried three times during it, and the tears just kept coming during the final scenes. I could really feel the pain the characters were experiencing, and I felt like I was going through it with them. I think it's a testament to how well written the book is.\n\n         Another book that really touched me was The Book Thief by Marcus Zuzak, I remember being moved to tears by the ending. The ending is so powerful, and it really left me feeling emotional for days. It was such a beautiful and emotional story, and the ending is one of the best I've ever read.\n\n         What books have made you cry?",

I also watched the BBC miniseries on Netflix where Druss is played by Gethin Anthony who does a great job but is not as visibly charismatic as Jackson). If you liked it and haven't read them all, the series continues with two sequels and another prequel (the Waylander series).

While reading it, I remember feeling a strong connection to the characters, especially the young protagonist, Liesel. As the story unfolded, the themes of love, loss, war, and the power of words were so vividly portrayed that I couldn't help but become increasingly emotionally invested. The surprising twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat, and by the end of the book, I felt a deep sense of sadness, yet at the same time, a sense of hope and newfound appreciation for the beauty and resilience of the human spirit.

(Maybe spoilers)\n        The post's content: For me, it was really unexpected:\n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved.\n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters.",

I think I was so attached to her because I identified with her plight growing up in an orphanage - and when she died, a part of me died with her. I spent the rest of the series, which my parents bought for me by the armload, hoping that maybe she could somehow come back. But, alas, my young heart was crushed.

I forgot about that one, but it will remain stuck in my mind as one of those books that really resonated with me in my childhood.\n\n        Different genre:\n         \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" - It may not have made me cry, but it definitely had a profound impact on me as a young reader.\n\n        Different emotional response:\n         \"Love in the Time of Cholera\" - Although it didn't make me cry specifically, it was a slow burn of an",

Another one is from the book \"The Fault in Our Stars\" - when Hazel and Gus are at the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam, and they sit on the bench outside and talk about what they want their legacies to be.

It was a beautiful book overall and I definitely recommend it.\n\n         I can see how \"Legend\" by David Gemmell might have been heart-wrenching, though. The premise sounds emotionally charged and I can definitely see how the events in the book could lead to some powerful emotional moments. I'll have to give it a read some day.\n\n         As for books that have made others cry, the final book in the Dark Tower series, \"The Dark Tower,\" is a commonly",

I remember feeling so invested in the characters and their lives that I was in tears multiple times throughout the book.

I've read the series multiple times, and Druss's journey is one I'll always cherish.\n         It's fascinating how different characters resonate with us at different points of our lives. For me, Druss and his wife's story was the first one that deeply moved me as an adult, but now I find myself tearing up during some of the other books in the series that deal with various forms of love and friendship. The bond between Druss and his companions, such as Bluestreak and Dragonbane, is another powerful reminder of the importance of loyalty and companionship, and the consequences of breaking those bonds.\n         As for the answer to your question, yes, I've read the entire series, including the sequels \"The First Chronicles of Druss the Legend,\" \"The",

The plot follows Amir's life through various periods in his life, as well as recounting various events and memories from his childhood that have deep emotional impact. Without going into too much detail to spoil it, one event in Amir's childhood in particular had a major emotional impact on me and left me struggling to read for several days.\n\n         I think part of the reason it had such a strong impact is because I felt a deep connection to the characters and their struggles, as well as the sense of nostalgia for a part of my own history that I couldn't relate to, but felt a strong emotional pull towards because of the book",

The way she leaves clues for Wilbur to meet her family in the barn was a nice touch, and definitely got me a little choked up. And of course, the last chapter when Miss Spider comes into his room and tells him that Charlotte died at home over the weekend was so sad but also bittersweet since Wilbur managed to make his way to the fair and sell enough tickets to make enough money for the barn to be paid for and keep it from being torn down.

He brings a gift, a copy of \"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" by Edward Fitzgerald, which he mistakenly believes is an ancient Persian poem that is sure to impress Reggie and his wife.

It's called The Dragonsworn Chronicles, and it's free to read on the website I co-founded with another author, StorySilo.",

Reading Bridge to Terabithia probably during the last year of elementary school - if not middle school. So it was a bit more age appropriate for that time in my life, compared to Legend.

I remember being a bit on the edge of my seat wondering if she made it safely across the river, and then her tragic death still had a pretty big impact on me. I was a pretty sensitive kid and I didn't read as voraciously or as frequently as I do now, so I remember being quite impacted by her death.

There were several emotional moments throughout that book, but the most emotional for me was near the end, where Ben finds the missing daughter, only to have her murdered in front of him. I couldn't believe it, and I remember sobbing in anger and sadness for at least a half hour after finishing the book. It was many years later that I learned the author had based the book on her own daughter's tragic death in a drowning accident, and I have to say it makes the book even more poignant for me now.

Specifically, I remember feeling particularly attached to Jamie in the earlier books, since he starts out as the main character, and it was heartbreaking to see what he goes through. The book that gets me the most emotionally invested is the sixth book, *A Breath of Snow and Ashes*, since it delves a lot into Jamie and Claire's relationship and the challenges they face during the American Revolution. It's a great series that I would highly recommend for anyone who enjoys a good romance or historical drama.",

The way it's written, with switching back and forth between Sal's present day and the past, it really builds up your connection to all the characters. I remember feeling like I could relate to them on a deeper level, because of the struggles they were going through with family, love, and identity. When the twist at the end happens, and you find out the truth about Sal's mother and grandfather, it all comes together in a bittersweet moment that makes you question everything you thought you knew. It definitely struck a nerve with me, and I think it's a perfect example of how powerful books can be in affecting our emotions. I remember I had to put the book down for a few minutes to process everything, and I still think about it from time to time. It's a powerful read that I'd definitely recommend to anyone,",

In the 90's it seems that books that had such a dramatic plot element were often assigned for reading in class.

The entire series is about the animals of Redwall trying to protect their home from various threats, but for me the climax was when Redwall is attacked by a group of ferrets and Sarah, a young mouse, is killed. The entire book is a lead up to this moment, with tension and fear building throughout, so it was a highly emotional moment for me. I really felt for all the characters, especially the young mice who had lost a friend, and it really hit me hard when Sarah died.",

I remember being absolutely devastated when Martin the Warrior died, especially since it happened towards the end of the book. It was the first time I'd really connected with a character in that way, so it definitely left an impact. Another one that comes to mind is when Harry Potter finds out Snape was working undercover for Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I didn't see it coming and it really made me feel emotional. I can only imagine how much more emotional it would have been if I had read the books as a kid, like you did with Martin the Warrior. Reading and connecting with characters in that way is one of the best parts of reading, but it also means that their deaths or other difficult moments can be really hard to handle. It's definitely something that can make a book memorable.\n\n         For instance,",

Plus, the fact that Jamie dies of Leukemia was a real heartwrencher, as I'd never experienced loss like that before.

One day, his beloved wife dies, and a couple, with their two young daughters, move in next door. Ove is not a fan of change, and at first, he does everything he can to make the family's lives miserable. However, over time, Ove begins to soften and comes to appreciate the family, especially the youngest daughter, who reminds him of his own daughter who died in a car accident.\n\n        Throughout the book, there are multiple moments that are heartwarming and emotional, but one that really stands out is when Ove finds out that the wife he loved so dearly was suffering from an incurable disease for years before she died. This revelation makes him realize",

The narrator is Death, and the story takes place during WW2 in Nazi Germany, and centers around a young girl named Liesel. Liesel is illiterate at first and is taught to read by the Jewish man who moves in next door to her. As the story continues, Liesel becomes deeply attached to the Jewish man, Max, and when he is taken away by the Nazis, it's heartbreaking.\n\n        Also, the character Liesel's little brother dies and it was just incredibly sad to read about such a young death, especially considering the context of the war. Definitely a tearjerker.\n\n        I'd love to hear about other emotional moments you've had while reading books!",

For a story about a mentally disabled man undergoing experimental surgery to make him more intelligent, the emotional turn the story eventually takes is heart-wrenching. It's the perfect mix of tragedy and science fiction, and it perfectly captures what it's like to watch a loved one suffer and decline. It's been awhile since I last read it, but even thinking about it now makes me misty-eyed.\n        For any wondering, the main character, Charlie, starts off as a mentally disabled man living in an institution, when he takes part in an experimental procedure to make him more intelligent. Over the course of the novel, he gradually becomes more intelligent, but eventually the procedure begins to reverse and he becomes mentally disabled once again, which leads to a truly devastating ending.\n        It's a truly unique and emotional story that I would highly recommend to anyone",

The book is renowned for its portrayal of the realities of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban, and the courage and determination of its female characters. The ending of the book is particularly emotional, as Mariam and Laila's son, Tariq, is killed in a suicide bombing.

The characters in that book are so well-developed and relatable, and the way that the author builds their relationships is truly touching. I won't give away the specific moment that made me cry, but it's one of those stories where you find yourself really caring about these characters and wanting the best for them.\n\n        What was the first book that made you cry, and why?

The book follows two young, magical, circus performers who fall in love with each other but are bound by a spell to a deadly competition. Without wanting to give too much away, towards the end of the book, there is a tragic and beautiful moment where one of the characters has to make a choice that ultimately leads to their tragic death. I remember being completely unable to put the book down and crying my eyes out when I read that scene. It was such a beautiful and tragic moment that I can still remember it clearly to this day. It truly left an impact on me and I believe it is a testament to the power of literature to move people and make them feel deeply for characters.\n        \n         I'd also like to mention another book that had a similar effect on me, which is \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zus",

He starts off as a stereotypical greaser and someone who follows the crowd, but as the story unfolds, he learns the importance of individuality and making his own decisions. The climax of the novel, where Ponyboy is forced to kill a Soc in self-defense and goes on the run, really shows his maturity and willingness to take responsibility for his actions. This is reflected in his emotional letter to his brother, Soda, which is filled with regret and a desire to protect those he cares about. Overall, The Outsiders was a powerful and thought-provoking read, and the ending left a lasting impact on me.\n\n        Here's a possible response:\n        I remember reading \"The Outsiders\" back in high school and being completely captivated by",

He walks in through the door to find his children at home, and you can just feel the love and relief in that moment as everyone is so happy to be reunited. It makes me tear up every time even thinking about it.\n\n        One of my other favorites is *Where the Red Fern Grows* by Wilson Rawls.

The book tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, an African American woman whose cancer cells were taken without her knowledge or consent and have been widely used in medical research. The stories of the Lacks family and the medical community intertwine, and the book raises important questions about bioethics, race, and poverty.

There are multiple moments throughout the book that are heart-wrenching, but the ending, where Jamie passes away, is the most emotional for me.

The story of Julie's escape from her unhappy circumstances on the edge of the Arctic Circle in Alaska and her journey to survive and find a place to belong among the wolves is a heart-wrenching tale of strength, courage, and survival. The story is based on the true story of \"Wuloo\" (Julie) who was an Inupiaq Eskimo woman who left her family at the age of 13. The book is a poignant exploration of Julie's loneliness, her longing for her mother, her struggles to fit in with both her Inupiaq and white schoolmates, and her determination to survive in the harsh Alaskan wilderness.

Throughout the harrowing ordeal, Pi must find a way to cope with their precarious situation and the constant threat of death.\n\n         As the novel progresses, it becomes increasingly apparent that Pi's story is also a deeply philosophical exploration of faith, existence, and the human condition",

I think what makes it so impactful is the sheer scope of the story, the wide range of characters, and the sense of impending doom that hangs over the entire book. Also, the fact that it's apocalyptic fiction, with humanity on the brink of extinction, makes it all the more poignant.
