The book tells the story of Charlie Nancy, a man who finds out that he has a brother, Spider, who is a trickster god. As Charlie deals with the revelation about his family, he also struggles with his own life and the choices he's made.\n\n         One of the most emotional moments in the book for me was when Charlie goes to a jazz concert with his brother's girlfriend, Fatima. They're sitting in the back, and Charlie starts getting overwhelmed by memories of his ex-girlfriend and the pain of their breakup. As the music plays, Fatima puts her hand on Charlie's shoulder and tells him that he's not alone, and that she's there for him. It was a simple moment, but it really resonated",

I don't think it was the first book that made me cry, but it definitely had a significant emotional impact on me. The way John Irving crafted the connection between Owen and the rest of the characters, especially the protagonist, was just so powerful. I found myself really caring about what happened to him, and when the end came, I was not surprised but I still felt a sense of loss. It was a beautiful and tragic book, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great story with some emotional punch.",

It was actually the fourth and final book in a fantasy series called \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" by George R.R. Martin, which was adapted into the TV show \"Game of Thrones\". The book is called \"A Dance with Dragons\" and the part that really got me was when we find out the fate of a certain character. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it, but it was a gut punch. It really made me feel a connection to the characters and their stories, despite the sometimes gruesome and difficult subject matter. Have you read that series?",

It's a beautiful book.\n         For the most part, I don't cry while reading books anymore because I usually read them in a single sitting and I get too wrapped up in it. But there are a few more that have been tear-jerkers for me. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is another one that hit me hard. The Depiction of the poverty and hardship those characters faced was absolutely heart-wrenching. I also get emotional every time I read Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, but it's not due to sadness. It's because I get so mad at how",

They share a romantic moment, and you can feel the hope they both feel for their future together. But, being a story about young love and terminal illness, it doesn't end well.

I'm pretty sure I was around 15 when I read it for the first time, so I was definitely a teenager.

I felt a similar emotion when I finished the last Harry Potter book - I couldn't believe that I was never going to get to see all those characters again. But with Anne it was especially poignant because I was nearing the end of my teen years myself. I was leaving the world of childhood behind and stepping into the wider world, and Anne, who had been such a part of my childhood reading life, was leaving it too. That's what made it extra sad.\n\n         Also, the end of [[To Kill a Mockingbird]] made me cry pretty hard, but that was",

The book follows the lives of a group of friends who meet while at college, and the story follows them into adulthood. The main character, Jude, experiences a lot of horrific abuse and trauma throughout his life, especially in his early years. The book delves deep into themes of love, sacrifice, trauma, and the impact it can have on someone's life. The ending of the book is especially heartbreaking, as Jude's past",

However, upon re-reading it as an adult, I felt those difficult moments much more intensely and was choked up and even saddened at certain parts. I'm glad you felt that too, and I agree that books can be magical in their ability to connect with us on a deeper level as we get older and gain more life experiences.\n\n        As for my personal experience with books that got me emotional, I'd have to say the first one that comes to mind is *The House on Mango Street* by Sandra Cisneros.

It was a powerful story that taught me a lot about the bond between humans and their pets, and the importance of following your dreams. I think it's a great read for anyone, regardless of age.\n\n        Additionally, my favorite book growing up was \"Are You There God, it's Me Margaret\" by Judy Blume. The coming-of-age story and the exploration of religion and faith really struck a chord with me, and I still remember many of the scenes vividly. It was a book that I felt really understood the struggles and questions of growing up, and it helped me to feel less alone in my journey. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend giving it a try.",

As a child, I identified so strongly with the protagonist, Billy, and his dream of owning a pair of hunting dogs. The bond he forms with Old Dan and Little Ann is truly special, and the story's tragic ending was heart-wrenching for me. Even though I read it many years ago, the image of Billy and the red fern still lingers in my memory.\n\n         I also enjoyed reading about the Drenai Saga, and *Legend* is definitely a strong emotional read.

It's a sweet story that's bound to make you cry, and the relationship between the boy and his dogs feels very authentic, in the sense that it's not overly sentimental or sugary and you really can feel the emotions in the characters.\n2. I love reading books that can surprise me by being either more or less emotional than I expected. Where the Red Fern Grows certainly had its fair share of emotion- I may have cried a bit. But, I also appreciate books that don't try too hard to be emotional- like the Dresden Files, which I also adore.\n3. I'm currently reading the Witcher series, and it's definitely a tearjerker. I",

In that book, a dog has multiple lives and tries to find its purpose, and in the end, it feels like the dog finds it in serving its human companion. The final scene was rather heart-wrenching for me. However, it's a book for adult readers. If you have a younger reader in mind, I would recommend \"Where the Red Fern Grows\" as it is meant for a younger audience and they might find it more relatable.\n\n         As for my personal experience, I teared up reading \"All the Light We Cannot See\" by Anthony Doerr. It is a beautiful and evocative story, and the ending is quite poignant. The writing is exceptional, and the characters are well-developed. If you haven't read",

I know it's a classic childhood book, and I do remember the emotional moments I felt with some of the books I read as a kid. The one that stands out in my mind, however, is actually a graphic novel, not a traditional novel: Maus, by Art Spiegelman. It's a two-volume graphic novel that tells the story of Spiegelman's father, a Holocaust survivor, and their relationship. I read it in my early 20s, and it was the first time I felt truly moved by a piece of literature. It's a powerful story, and I think it's important for everyone to read and understand the history of the Holocaust. It's not an easy read, but it's definitely worth it.",

The fact that it made you cry as a kid and still stays with you is a testament to the author's writing skills. I can imagine that readings it as an adult, the emotional impact might be different, but it's still worth experiencing.\n\n        2. I also remember reading the first book of the Drenai Saga, namely \"Legend\" by David Gemmell, which is the book you mentioned in your post. It was a fantastic read for me as well.

During this process, he develops a deep bond with the previous Receiver, who is now an outcast because his memories are too painful for the community to handle. When Jonas finds out that the previous Receiver is going to be eliminated, he refuses to forget the memories he's been given and leaves the community with the previous Receiver.

The events seemed to happen so quickly, and the author ended the book on a bit of a cliffhanger, which left me feeling as if I had been thrown into a storm and left to drift with no land in sight. I had to set the book down and take a few moments to myself, and I still think about the characters and the world Martin created to this day.

The way the scene is written and the emotions expressed by Perrin make it easy for readers to empathize with his pain. I think it is this emotional connection that makes the scene so affecting.\n\n         As for me, the first book that made me cry was \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman. The final scene, where Ove is reunited with his beloved wife, Sonja, brought me to tears. The beautiful and poignant way the scene is described, and the emotional journey that the character undergoes throughout the book, made it a moving and memorable read for me.",

I remember I was in middle school when I read it and I just fell in love with the characters, especially Hazel - she was so relatable and yet so unique in her experiences with cancer. When she and Gus went to Amsterdam in search of the doctor who designed the anaglyphs that show metaphors of cancer cells growing, I was so invested in their journey and I just knew something bad was going to happen. When Gus died, I felt like it happened to someone I knew IRL - I cried for hours and had to take a break from reading it for a few days. I still think about Hazel and Gus to this day, and the story is still my favorite of all time.",

I'd definitely recommend it.\n\n        If you're looking for similar fantasy books that are emotional and engaging, two other series I'd recommend are the Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss, and the First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie. Both have complex characters and intricately plotted stories, with emotional impact that sticks with you long after you've finished the book.\n\n        As for what books have made me cry, it's been quite awhile since I was really moved by a book, but two that come to mind are \"A Man",

I read it when I was about 13, and the ending was especially tear-jerking because the case didn't go the way we wanted it to. I don't recommend reading it so young, but it was a powerful book that has stuck with me to this day.\n        2. \"The Fault in Our Stars\" by John Green. It is a young adult novel about two teenagers with cancer who fall in love. I read it when I was about 16, and the ending was heartbreaking.

It was heartbreaking to see him go through so much, but also uplifting in the end to see some redemption.\n        3. \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak - This is a story about a young girl during World War II but it's also just a beautiful story about the power of words and literature.

The revelation at the end is a poignant and powerful moment that can be emotional for many people. When the main character, Sal, discovers the truth about her grandmother's past, it brings up a lot of feelings about loss, forgiveness, and the complexities of family relationships. It's definitely a book that can be impactful and memorable.\n\n        One aspect of the book that I find particularly moving is the way that it uses multiple narratives to explore themes such as family, identity, and the power of storytelling. By interweaving Sal's account of her own experiences with her grandmother's story, the author creates a rich and nuanced portrait of these themes.",

It's a magical adventure that gets better everytime I read it. If you like Inkheart, I highly reccomend the Inkspell series, which continues the adventures of Meggie and Mo, as well as the Inkworld trilogy, which is a prequel series that explores the early life of the main villain in Inkheart.

For me, the first book that made me cry was \"A Walk To Remember\" by Nicholas Sparks. I read it when I was about 15, and I remember being a wreck when I finished it. I think what really got to me was the way it explored the idea of love being selfless and putting others before yourself, but still being beautiful. The relationship between the two main characters, Jamie and Landon, was so pure and genuine, and their struggles to make it work hit me hard. I'm not sure if I'd cry again if I read it",

As for the specific moment that got me, it's hard to pick just one, but one that comes to mind is when Katniss is given the option to execute Coin, the President of the Capitol, and she ultimately decides to make the same sort of sacrifice that Coin herself had previously made, by letting Katniss and her allies live and sparing the lives of other revolutionaries in the process.

The scenes where Scout, the young protagonist, witnesses the prejudice and cruelty directed towards the African American characters, and where her father, Atticus Finch, is brutally criticized for his decision to defend a black man in court, are particularly affecting. I think part of what makes the book so powerful is the way the story is told from a child's perspective, which allows us to see the complexities of the situation through the eyes of someone who is naive and innocent, but also deeply perceptive.

The way the story explores the limitations and fragility of human intelligence is really profound, and it's even more emotional knowing that the story is based on a real-life case study. The transformation of Charlie, from his initial excitement and curiosity about his operations, to his eventual decline and realization that he is losing his intelligence again, is really moving. I think the reason it's so powerful is that it touches on so many universal themes: the fear of losing one's intellect, the desire to be \"normal\" or understood, and the sadness of realizing that the world is moving on without us. It's a great book, and I think it's worth a read if you haven't already.\n\n         For me, it's one of those books that really",

Definitely a great choice for the first book that made you really cry.\n\n         For me, one of the most memorable emotional moments in a book that I've read was the scene in The Lord of the Rings where Samwise carries Frodo up Mount Doom. It's just such a powerful moment of friendship and bravery, and I always find myself tearing up whenever I reach it in the book. It's a great reminder of the kind of bond that can form between friends, and the lengths that people will go to for each other. Definitely a must-read for anybody looking for some truly emotional moments in their books.",

It's not that I don't get emotional, I just don't get emotional about books. I've noticed it happens more in short stories or graphic novels. But one of the books that has made me cry, and also made me laugh, was \"The Fault in Our Stars.\" I didn't expect to enjoy it, but I was swept away by the wit and charm of the characters, and I found myself laughing and crying right along with them. I knew it was coming, but I still couldn't help getting emotional. And the ending was so bittersweet, I was left feeling a mix of sadness and happiness. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a book that's funny and heartbreaking all at once.",

I don't think I would necessarily have the same emotional response to a movie adaptation, but the book has a way of getting under your skin in a way that feels more personal.

There's a scene where White Fang, the wolf-dog hybrid, is brutally whipped by a Yeeater, and it was so heartbreaking to read. The whole book is filled with sadness and despair, and the way London writes each scene and character made me feel like I was right there in the story. It was a powerful emotional experience that I'll never forget. How about you? What book made you cry first?",

I cried again later in the book with Jonas's realization of the hypocrisy and cruelty of society.\n\n         Another book that made me cry was A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness. The relationship between the boy and his mother was so well portrayed and when she died, it was devastating. I also cried during Wonder by R.J. Palacio, when Auggie's bully became nicer to him.\n\n         I think the most memorable tears though were when I read A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas when Feyre dies.

Her father, who struggles to provide for the family, tries to console her by saying that the house was just a temporary thing, but she knows it meant so much more than that to her. It's a poignant moment that really highlights the theme of loss and the fleeting nature of childhood.\n         another one that made me cry recently was The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. The ending was so heart-wrenching that it brought me to tears.\n         it's just so unfair how fragile life is and how much people suffer. i wish i could say something more uplifting, but i think it's important to acknowledge the pain and the hardship that we all face in",

And I think that's why it affected me so much. The bond between the greasers was so strong that it made their deaths that much more heartbreaking.

I share the sentiment that reading a book with a non-happy ending can be incredibly impactful and moving, even if it's not a kids/YA book. One book that comes to mind for me is \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee. The ending of that book is definitely not a happy one, and it stayed with me long after I finished reading it. The themes of racial injustice and moral complexity were very impactful, and I think it's a book everyone should read at least once.\n\n         In terms of a book that made me cry, the one that immediately comes to mind is \"A Little Life\" by Hanya Yanagihara. It's a very long and intense book that follows the lives of a group of close friends who all have their own unique struggles and traumas",

I was definitely the type of kid who would imagine what life would be like if I had to live the way the Bradys did, and it was intense to get that representation in a book. I think it's a classic YA series that's often overlooked because of the simplicity that comes with the subject being so familiar and relatable to a lot of kids. Even though it was published in the 80s, I think there's still a lot to learn from it about the value of each individual person and the struggles of being different in a society that doesn't always recognize or appreciate that difference.",

It's a selfless thing for her to say, but it's also a heartbreaking moment because the son needs her and can't imagine his life without her.

I read it a few years ago and I still think about the characters and their story quite often. I won't give away any major spoilers but there is a particularly sad moment towards the end of the book that really made me cry. I think what made the book so impactful for me was the way the author captured the ups and downs of a long-term relationship and the tiny, seemingly insignificant moments that can have a big impact. The book also had a bit of a nostalgic feel to it, as it follows two characters from their early 20s to mid-life, and I think that added to the emotional impact of the story.

The Kite Runner is another one that comes to mind, as well as The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah. Both novels have rich emotional depth and characters that feel very real.

I'd say it's more of a \"read-with-a-box-of-tissues\" type of book.\n\n         I also thought the same with \"The Night Circus\" by Erin Morgenstern. I read it in the same year and I had mixed feelings about it - I loved the atmosphere and descriptions, but I found the plot to be a little underwhelming. But as I read more and more, I found",

It's about a boy named Billy who dreams of having a pair of hunting dogs so he could hunt for raccoons and other small game with them. He saves up his money and finally buys a beautiful pair of dogs named Old Dan and Little Ann. They become the best of friends and together they have many adventures, but eventually an accident leads to Old Dan's death. I still remember the scene where Billy finds Old Dan lying in the field, hit by a car. I bawled my eyes out reading that book and the tears still come to my eyes when I think about it now as an adult.\n\n         The book is a classic, so I'm sure that many people have read it and can relate to the emotional impact it has. It's a powerful story that teaches valuable lessons about friendship, determination, and loss. If",

It's a sweet and touching story that will definitely make you cry.\n        3. The Fault in Our Stars by John Green - This one is a classic. Hazel and Gus are two teenagers with cancer who fall in love, and their story is just so heartwrenching.\n        4. The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky - This book is about a socially awkward teenager named Charlie who",

And the writing is so engaging and descriptive that it's hard not to get caught up in the story, even if you're not a child. I think that's part of what makes it such a classic.\n         I've also read other books by E.B. White, such as Stuart Little and The Trumpet of the Swan, and they'",
