    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

These are the ones I think everyone should read. In no particular order:\n\n         1. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee: this classic novel about racial injustice and morality still resonates today because, unfortunately, racial prejudice is still an issue. I think it's a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the complexities of race relations and how they've evolved over time.\n\n         2. \"1984\" by George Orwell: This dystopian novel is one of my favorites because it's a warning about the potential dangers of totalitarian governments and how they can",

The main character, Sara Crewe, is transported from the luxury of her life in India to the poverty of 19th century London after her father's sudden death. Though initially treated kindly, the headmisss of the school she is sent to is cruel, and the other pupils bully her.

The series is largely about survival in a post-apocalyptic world, and Riko's past is revealed through flashbacks. The climax of the second book, Quicksilver, is particularly emotional as Riko goes through a harrowing journey to save his loved ones. I was so invested in the characters and their struggles, that I couldn't help but shed a few tears.\n\n         Another book that made me tear up was The Bone People by Karen Stefano. The novel is about a family living in New Zealand, and I found myself getting really attached to the characters, especially the young girl, Kerewin. The storyline is very melancholic and the way the characters interact with each other is very emotional. It is a powerful read that",

At the end when Jonas was walking away, his memories and thoughts just hit me like a wall and it was such a profound moment. There was also one part earlier in the book where Jonas was walking through the City of Memory and came across footage of a war he didn't remember happening, and the grief he felt after remembering what he had lost really got to me. I was very young when I read it, and I think I was a particularly sensitive reader, but I still remember that feeling today, even years later.",

The story tells the tale of a grumpy, isolated old man named Ove, who has lost touch with everyone around him, and the unlikely friendship that develops with his new neighbors. The book is heartwarming, hilarious, and beautifully tragic, as Ove faces loss, change, and the need to let go of the past. I still get a bit choked up thinking about it.\n2. Another book that impacted me was \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. The tale of the Little Prince traveling the stars, exploring different worlds, and learning life lessons along the way, is both whimsical and profound. The story's message about the importance of relationships, love",

He is the son of a wealthy businessman, and his friend Hassan, who is actually a Hazara servant boy in his household. Despite their differences, Amir and Hassan have a strong bond, and Amir even claims that he's closer to Hassan than his brother. But this bond is challenged when Amir betrays Hassan in a moment of fear and cowardice. The book follows Amir as he flees Afghanistan and tries to make a new life for himself in the United States, but is haunted by his guilt and the memory of Hassan.

The book captures the joy and sorrow that comes with owning a pet, and the bond between Billy and his dogs is so heartwarming. The moment that always gets me is when Billy releases Old Dan from his pain and suffering, it's such a sad and emotional ending that really sticks with you. It's a great book for both kids and adults, I highly recommend it.\n\n         For me, the first book that made me cry was A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The story follows a young girl named Sarah Crewe, who is sent to a boarding school in England after her father goes off to fight in the war. At the school, Sarah endures mistreatment and hardship, but she never loses her spirit or hope.",

I thought maybe the series was going to go downhill from there, but as it turns out, King did an amazing job bringing everything together in the final books. The ending was definitely divisive but for me, it was a fitting conclusion to the series and the loss of Susannah in The Dark Tower was a pivotal moment that really made the story come alive.\n\n         I've also had similar moments with other books, like the end of The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern, where I was emotionally invested in the characters and the story, and it was truly heartbreaking when everything came to an end.

The second book, \"A Way of Kings,\" is even better than the first, and I also teared up several times throughout that book, too.  I think that Gemmell was able to create very realistic and compelling characters that it was easy to become emotionally attached to.  The saga follows a series of different characters as the world is repeatedly threatened by various enemies, and the writing is very deep and immersive.  I also appreciated that it was a different kind of fantasy, with less of an emphasis on magic and more on the political and social aspects of the world.\n\n         If you're looking for something similar in terms of emotional impact, I'd also recommend the book \"A Dance with Dragons\" by George R.R. Martin.  Like the Drenai Saga, it is part of a larger series (the A Song of Ice and Fire",

I remember feeling like Charlotte's sacrifice was noble and heartbreaking - it's a beautiful story that definitely made an impact on me as a child.\n\n         For a more recent example, I was very touched by the scene in \"The Night Circus\" where Marco and Prospera make a wish together. It's a beautiful, bittersweet moment that encapsulated the sense of destiny and fate that ran throughout the entire book, and it made me feel genuinely sad as I realized how the characters were inevitably headed towards their tragic end.\n\n         What about you? What books or scenes have made you cry or get choked up, and why?",

I first read it when I was in 5th grade and I was sucked into Jess and Leslie's friendship, their worlds of Terabithia, and their adventure together. I'll always remember the devastating moment at the end when Leslie dies, Leslie's funeral, and Jess remembering her spirit and the world they created together. Such a great read!\n        2. I've read \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak and it's definitely a tearjerker. The ending gets me every time with the beautiful imagery and Liesel's character development throughout the book.\n        3. \"The Fault in Our Stars\" by John Green moved me so much, too. I read it when I was a bit older (16-17),",

The way the author weaves the complex relationships and the backstory of the character Jude, who has experienced multiple forms of abuse, is heart wrenching and gut wrenching. I couldn't look away, even though I knew the pain Jude had to go through. The book is a testament to the power of love and perseverance, and the author's writing is amazing and thought provoking.

It was probably a little more emotional for me because my brother died from a drug overdose and our oldest son was at a point similar to what happens in the book with our youngest son. The plot revolves around God asking the protagonist to forgive the person who was responsible for his daughter's death and it definitely got to me as our son's father was the one responsible for our son's death. It really messes with your emotions as it all happens in this old cabin where the girl was killed.

I felt such a strong bond with them and it broke my heart to see them struggle with their pasts, present, relationships, and fears. The raw emotions portrayed in the book resonated with me in a way that no other book has before, and the ending was sobittersweet that I had to get out of my car and walk around for a bit to collect myself before continuing to function in the world.

The book is about Charlie, a man with learning disabilities, who undergoes a medical procedure that temporarily boosts his intelligence. The story is told through the perspective of Charlie and his journal entries, so as both his intelligence and understanding of the world around him grows, so does the reader's. At the end, Charlie experiences a regression back to his previous state, and the book ends with a poignant and powerful ending that had me crying heavily. The book was written in 1966, and it still manages to be relevant to the current discussions about intelligence, disabilities, and the ethical treatment of those with disabilities. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a truly emotional and impactful read.",

I had never read anything that touched me so deeply before, and I still think about it to this day. I think the book is particularly powerful because of its unique structure - it's narrated by the main character, Charlie Gordon, as he's undergoing a medical procedure that's supposed to increase his intelligence. The chapters alternate between \"normal\" chapters that follow Charlie's life and his thoughts and feelings as he navigates the world, and \"retardate\" chapters that reflect Charlie's limited perspective before the procedure. This device allows the reader to really feel Charlie's struggle and growth as a person, and to share in his triumphs and disappointments. The ending of the book, in which Charlie realizes that the procedure is slowly being reversed and he's reverting to his pre-procedure state, is heart-",

The scene where the two characters are reunited after such a long struggle was very powerful. I felt the emotional tension between the two of them throughout their journey was very realistic. It was an interesting perspective to see the story through the eyes of a simple warrior, rather than a prince or a mage. I found myself rooting for Druss often, even when things seemed hopeless.\n        2. While I love the Harry Potter series, I have to admit that I never got that emotional about Dumbledore's death. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely a memorable moment in the book, but it didn't hit me as hard as it did some people. I think this is because I've already grown attached to Harry, Hermione, and Ron, and D",

I still have a soft spot for that book and that quote, and it's one of the first books that really made me feel something strong when I was young.\n\n         For your book recommendation, I would suggest The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. It's a young adult novel about a high school freshman who is struggling to find his place in the world. It's a beautifully written book that deals with themes of mental health, self-discovery, and friendship, and it's one of my favorite books of all time. The main character, Charlie, is also",

It's a story of twin siblings, Noah and Jude, and their relationship with each other and their parents. The book is split into two parts, one from Noah's perspective and one from Jude's, and I think that really added to the emotional impact of the story.\n\n         My favorite part of the book is when Jude meets her first love, Craig, at a gay club in New York City. They have this beautiful, explosive connection, and it's clear that it's something that Jude has been dreaming of for so long. But, as they continue to see each other, they realize that they're not really compatible - Craig wants to move to California and live with his boyfriend, while Jude wants to stay in New York and be near her family.\n\n         In",

I love the story of how she remains hopeful and continues to believe in the power of kindness and love, even in the face of adversity.\n         As for other books that have",

I feel this is very common practise especially nowadays due to the rise of TikTok leading a lot of books to be simplified down to their tropes. A book I feel was marketed incorrectly is probably Song Of Achillies by Madeline Miller. I read the UK edition of this book, and on the cover the book is described as being \u2018dark\u2019 and \u2018sexy\u2019. After having read the book this is pretty disturbing given that the only sexual scenes take place when the characters are very young / underage (all others fade to black).

The nightmares seem to be coming to life, and it's incredibly hard to tell if it's some kind of supernatural force or if it's just a manifestation of her guilt. In one scene, one of the girls kills herself, and the other girls find her hanging from the tree. She was always the kindest girl in the school, and the scene felt completely unbearable.

Della sacrifices her long hair to get jim a platinum chain for his watch, not knowing that he sold his watch to buy her gifts.\n\n         I think it struck me because at that point in my life, I didn't have much to give to other people, so the idea that someone would willingly make those types of sacrifices for someone else was really moving to me.\n\n         I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quick,",

The story is about a young girl named Esperanza who grows up in a poor neighborhood in Chicago. Throughout the book, Esperanza encounters various hardships and struggles, but it's the relationships she forms that really tug at the heartstrings. The last chapter, \"Somebody Almost Didn't Make It,\" is particularly moving.\n         As Esperanza tells the story of her friend Minerva, who was almost hit by a car and killed, it starts to feel like a eulogy for a beloved friend. The prose is beautiful, and the emotions are raw and real. By the end of the chapter, I was definitely shedding a few tears.\n\n         For me, what makes \"The House on",

But the main character, Landon, was so devoted and caring, and the ending was just so heartbreaking that I was a wreck. I think it was the first time I really connected with a book on an emotional level, and it made me want to read more.\n\n         For a different kind of sadness, I also remember \"The Catcher in the Rye\" really impacting me when I read it in high school. I hadn't had any experiences Holden Caulfield was going through, but I felt so sympathetic to him despite his flaws and self-destructiveness. It made me want to reach out to people who seemed troubled, and I think it's a book that's stuck with me in a lot of ways",

The child's resilience in overcoming such an unimaginably difficult upbringing is truly inspiring. I still think of the story often and I'm so glad it had such a positive impact on you as well.\n\n         Another book that really got to me was The Book Thief by Markus Zusak. The story follows a young girl named Liesel who is sent to live with a foster family during World War II in Nazi Germany. The story is told through the perspective of Death itself, and it's such a beautifully written, heartbreaking tale of loss, friendship, and perseverance in the face of unimaginable hardship. It's one of those rare books that I can't seem to shake from my thoughts, and I often find myself returning to it.",

It's one of the few books that can make you laugh, cry, and just feel so many emotions while you read it. It's truly life-changing in a lot of ways.\n\n         If you haven't read that one yet, have you read anything that's made you cry or feel deeply affected",

The way the teacher's death is described, particularly the image of his delicate appearance and the idea that he transcends beyond the protagonist, can be quite emotional. I've read the story myself and found it to be a beautifully written and impactful book. In your case, it seems to have struck a chord with you even more, as it reminded you of your own fears about the impending loss of a loved one. It's a lovely book and I can see why you might want to reread it when spring arrives. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!\n         For anyone who might be interested in *The Glass Bead Game*, it's a novel that takes place in a dystopian future where society is based on intellectual pursuits.

I still get a little emotional when I think about it. It was so sudden and devastating, and Gennaro was such a dynamic character. It made me realize the danger and wildness of the dinosaurs, and that they were definitely not just big lizards.\n         For another emotional moment in a book, I'd have to go with *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee. When I read the scene where Tom Robinson is acquitted but immediately arrested and beaten, I couldn't help but feel anger and sadness. It was a powerful reminder of the racism that still existed, and still exists, in America.\n         These emotional moments in books made me feel connected to the characters and really invested in the stories, and I love feeling that deep",
