    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

I read it in December 2019, and it's not a book I will ever forget. The book follows four college friends who move to New York after graduation. The main character, Jude, has a secret about his past that is gradually revealed, and it's heartbreaking and infuriating to read about. The book deals with themes of child abuse, neglect, and poverty, as well as mental health and self-destructive behavior. I didn't expect to cry so much while reading it, but the ending took me completely by surprise and left me in tears.\n\n         Another book that comes to mind is \"The Kite Runner\" by Khaled Hosseini. It's a story about friendship and redemption, set",

The way that Irving builds up the relationship between Owen Meany and the main character, and the way that their lives are intertwined in a seemingly coincidental, yet profound, way, is so captivating and heartbreaking at the same time. The way that Owen dies, while saving the main character, is such a powerful moment that totally consumed me and I had a hard time reading the last few pages because of the emotional impact.

Sometimes it's those books that make us feel a little more human, and _A Widow for One Year_ definitely did that for me.

It's a beautiful, sad book that is difficult to read but is very rewarding.\n\n         This reminds me of A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving. The book is about a boy who was inexplicably and miraculously saved from a terrible accident when he was a baby, but ends up being one of the key pieces in a complicated, historical, cold-case murder mystery. The book is sad, funny, sweet, and emotional, and it has a memorable and profound ending that makes you",

It's a book that has definitely stayed with me over the years.\n\n          I can't think of anything else that's made me cry as much, though there have been other books that have had a strong emotional impact on me. For example, The Giver by Lois Lowry is a dystopian novel that explores themes of memory, control, and sacrifice.

A few books that come to mind as having an impact on me in that way are \"The Kite Runner\" by Khaled Hosseini, \"A Little Life\" by Hanya Yanagihara, and \"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn.

The character of King Leonidas was particularly moving, as he led his men to their deaths with bravery and determination.

In \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\u201d by Gregory Maguire, when Elphaba dies. Definitely a very sad moment and a good one for Maguire to include as a pay off to their struggles throughout the novel.\n\n        3. In \u201cPeter Pan\u201d by J.M. Barrie, when Wendy loses Peter after he\u2019s gone back to Neverland. A classic example of a tearjerker in children\u2019s literature.\n\n        4.

It was so heartbreaking, especially because we as readers knew that Eddie and Roland had grown close and we could see that Eddie truly cared for Oy like his own son. And then Roland, being torn between his duty to the Tower and his love for Eddie, had to make a difficult decision and leave them behind. It was just a really emotional moment and made me choke up for sure.\n\n         Some other emotional moments in books that come to mind include when Dobby dies in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" and the ending of \"The Giver\" by Lois Lowry. How about you? What book made you cry or get choked up? No matter what they are, I'd love to hear about your emotional moments in reading!",

The main character of the series is also someone I deeply care about, and I was reminded of the strong bond between me and my loved ones while reading the series.\n\n          For those interested in finding books that can evoke emotional reactions, I'd recommend checking out the \"Throne of Glass\" series.

The scene with Jon and Ghost on the Wall was particularly hard for me, because I'm a dog person, but also because I'd grown so attached to Jon as a character. I know it's just a book, but characters like Jon feel very real, and sometimes it's hard to handle when bad things happen to them.

When I think about it, I wonder if Alcott would have written such a heartbreaking ending if she had married that man who proposed to her so many times and never taken the answer.\n\n         I'm curious about what other books can make you cry. I like the ones that make you ugly-cry because you feel the emotion so strongly. What makes you cry? Books? Life? Or perhaps a combination?\n\n        <<END>>",

The emotional depth and richness of the story, along with the heart-wrenching characters, are surely part of the reason it's known for making readers tear up. From the tragic romance between Jean Valjean and Fantine, to the eventual reunion of Valjean with his adopted daughter, Cosette, the novel is a rollercoaster of feelings that leave you emotionally drained. I find myself getting choked up each time I read those specific scenes, even knowing what will happen. The sheer despair Valjean experiences throughout the story, along with his journey towards redemption, is something I believe resonates with many readers. It's a story that transcends time and captures the human experience in a way few other books accomplish, making it a must-read for any book lover.",

They discover a secret wooden bridge in the woods behind Jesse's house and create an imaginary kingdom called Terabithia, where they play and escape from the real world. But when Leslie's life is tragically cut short, Jess is devastated and has to learn how to deal with the loss. This book was the first one that made me cry, and it still does to this day.

The love and bond between Jesse and Leslie is so deeply portrayed and it's heart-wrenching to see it destroyed.\n\n         Another book that made me cry is \"The Perks of Being",

That scene with the flood and Jess being swept away was just so heart wrenching. My heart still hurts thinking about it today. And I know exactly what you mean about running into your mom's room wailing! I had the same experience with Where the Red Fern Grows - I was devastated when Old Dan died. I know it's a sad story, but I don't think it got the attention it deserved because it's about boys and hunting dogs. It's truly a classic though, as is Bridge to Terabithia. It's a great reminder of the power of imagination, friendship, and loss. Reading those books were truly emotional experiences for me, and I'm glad it had such an impact on you too.",

The main character, Conor, is dealing with his mother's terminal illness and the difficult relationships with his parents. The story revolves around the monster, a giant yew tree that visits Conor and tells him difficult stories that help him deal with his feelings. The story is dark, but also full of hope and beautiful writing. The end, where the monster and Conor have finished their cycle of visits, is incredibly touching.

I don't know if it's the best book by John Green, or even the best in its genre, but it definitely did it's job.\n\n         I don't feel guilty for putting that book down after finishing it, though. It's a good book, but I didn't feel that emotional attachment to it that I did in other books, or the way I do after finishing it. So I didn't feel the need to re-read it like I did with others.\n\n         Another book",

The book explores themes of religion, existentialism, and the nature of humanity. The emotional climax of the book, which is the reason I started crying, occurs towards the end of the book when Pi is recounting his experiences to an interviewer, and it is revealed that he has been lying about some of the events that happened at sea.

It was \"The Shack\", a book where the protagonist (Mack) goes back to the place where his daughter was murdered, and the three main characters of the Bible (God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit) are all there waiting for him.\n\n         What I really appreciated about this book was the way it addressed questions about God and the Bible, especially with the idea that sometimes we create our own images of God that are not truly who He is. It was very thought-provoking and gave a unique perspective on what might happen when we die.\n\n         I think one of the hardest parts, for me, was when Mack started talking to God and felt like He had abandoned him. I think that is a feeling almost everyone has at some point and it was nice to see that even if Mack had that feeling, God was still there for him.",

The way the book ends is also so bittersweet and leaving you feeling conflicted about what happened. This book really captured my heart with its incredible writing and heartfelt characters.

A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini - The whole book is difficult to read, but the ending was devastating and I ended up bawling in the bathroom. The book is a powerful depiction of war and cultural expectations on women.\n        3. The Book Thief by Markus Zusak - I don't know why, but the moment Death picks up the protagonist at the end got me every time. The book is a powerful exploration of World War II and how literature can help us cope with difficult times.\n        4. The Perks of",

The book is a semi-autobiographical novel narrated by a horse who experiences many hardships throughout his lifetime, including neglect, abuse, and being used solely for the labor of others. Despite these struggles, Beauty maintains a strong spirit and love for humanity. The scene that ultimately brought me to tears was when Beauty was old and near death, reflecting on his life with memories of the good times he had with his various owners and regretting the times when they failed to recognize his needs and treat him with kindness. I felt such profound empathy for Beauty in that moment that it was hard to keep my emotions in check, and the sadness lingered with me for quite some time afterwards.\n\n         I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to explore their emotional side or simply has an interest in the life of a horse.

The story follows the life of a horse named Black Beauty, from his early days as a colt on an English farm, through his childhood with a kind and loving family, to his later years working in London as a carriage horse. Throughout the book, Beauty experiences many hardships and difficulties, but he remains optimistic and hopeful. One of the most emotionally impactful scenes for me was when Beauty was abused by a cruel and selfish owner, and he was forced to work long hours without rest or food. Despite his suffering, Black Beauty never lost his spirit or his faith in humanity, and he always tried to do what was right. It's a powerful and moving story about the nature of kindness, compassion, and love.\n\n         For instance, the following:\n         The post's title:",

I found myself choking up reading about his fate, just as the other characters had done throughout the story. It was a poignant reminder of the dangers of serving Dumbeldore and the lengths people will go to for the greater good, even in death.\n        2. Another emotional moment for me was in The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern. The climax of the story had me in tears, particularly as it brought closure to some of the characters' stories.\n        3. In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, the moment when Norrell makes a personal sacrifice to save the life of a child, despite his own pain, was a powerful moment that left me feeling both heartbroken and hopeful.\n\nI'd love to hear about additional emotional moments in books for you and others!",

That scene is certainly a powerful moment, and not just because it's a significant plot development. J.K. Rowling masterfully crafts the emotional bond between Harry and Dumbledore, setting aside time to develop their relationship over the series. The impact of that relationship and the pain of losing a mentor who held such a dear place in Harry's heart is indeed palpable. A truly bittersweet moment that leaves a lasting impression.",

I won't give any spoilers, but there is a certain scene near the end of the book that made me cry more than any other book I've ever read. It's a truly powerful and moving story, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a book that will touch their heart.",

I found the portrayal of Achilles and Patroclus's relationship to be incredibly moving, and the way it was written made it feel so real. I also grew attached to the other characters in the book, and was rooting for them to survive.\n        3. \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman was another book that made me emotional.

Can't wait to hear about other books or moments that have made you feel that same emotional connection!",

There's a moment in the book where Gus reads a letter Hazel wrote to him before they met, and then another moment where Hazel tells Gus about her wish, which is to visit a real-life anagram of its title (Anne Frank's house). These moments were too much for me to handle, as I was really invested in the characters and their love story.\n\n         Another book that brought me to tears was A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. It's a story about a group of college friends, but it focuses on the life of one of them, Jude, who is a sexual abuse survivor. The graphic descriptions of his abuse and the effects it had on him throughout his entire life were",

I was happy when they came to the final solution and you could just see an almost-glee come over the husband as he finally got to crack the case - it was an interesting contrast to his usual hardboiled demeanor. I loved the way the two of them worked together as a team, it was great. I haven't read the rest of the series (I plan to though), but this one stays with me as one of the best.",

You can feel the raw emotion between the two characters as they bid their final farewells, knowing that they'll never see each other again. The way Green writes the dialogue between the two characters makes it feel so real and relatable, that it's easy to find yourself tearing up as you read along. It was the first book that truly made me feel a powerful emotional connection to the characters and the story, and I think it's a must-read for anyone who enjoys emotionally-driven YA novels.\n\n         On a side note, I also have to comment on how the film adaptation failed to capture the true essence and emotion of the story.

The emotions were so raw and real, it was almost overwhelming at times. It's a difficult book to read, but it's definitely a book that will stay with you long after you've turned the last page.\n         I also have to recommend A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara, which will absolutely rip your heart out. It's a heartbreaking, but beautiful book that explores the complexities of friendship and humanity.\n\n         For another fantasy book, I'd have to recommend The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. The emotional payoff in that book is amazing, and the way the author weaves the story together is truly impressive.\n         What was a book that made you cry, and why did it affect you so much?

The main character, Ove, is a grumpy, stubborn, and somewhat lonely older man. As I got to know him and his background, I formed a strong emotional connection with him. In one scene, Ove is in a hospital and has a heart attack. The scene is written so poignantly that it brought me to tears. It's a beautiful, heartwarming book that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good cry!\n\n         My favorite line from the book is: \"A life spent outside the universe, outside of everything, is no life at all.\" It perfectly encapsulates the essence of the book and Ove's struggle to find meaning in his life.",

For me, there are two books that stick out in my mind where a character's death hit me particularly hard:\n\n1. \"The Hate U Give\" by Angie Thomas - the death of Khalil, the protagonist's friend and someone close to her family, is a tragic highlight of the book. It drives the entire narrative forward and is portrayed in a gripping, emotional way.\n\n2. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee - the death of Mr. Radley (or as the kids call him, \"Boo\") is a poignant end to the books. It's a lesson in the power of silence and the beauty of human decency.\n\nWhat about you? Any books that made you cry because of a character death?",

I remember reading it on the bus and having to wipe away tears multiple times as the story unfolded.\n\n         Another one was *My Beloved World* by Sonia Sotomayor. As a young, aspiring lawyer, I found her story to be incredibly inspiring and emotional. I was particularly moved by her descriptions of her close relationship with her strict but loving mother, and the lessons she learned from her that helped shape her into the successful woman she is today.\n\n         Lastly, *The Nightingale* by Kristin Hannah left me sobbingly. The story follows the lives of two sisters during World War II, and the extraordinary challenges they faced",

            "comment_text": "The Kite Runner made me cry. The main character, Amir, has a best friend, Hassan. Hassan grows up serving Amir's family and is of a lower caste. Although they were close as children, Amir never stands up for Hassan when he is being bullied, and eventually betrays him in a terrible way. Hassan's suffering is a constant undercurrent throughout the book, and although Amir tries to atone for his actions, the consequences follow him for the rest of his life. The climax of the book, where Amir finally confronts Hassan's ghost, is incredibly moving, and I found myself in tears.\n\n         For me, the emotion of the story comes from the complex and relatable emotions of guilt, regret, and redemption, and the exploration of the complex bonds of friendship and loyalty. I can definitely relate to Amir's desire to atone for his past mistakes",

                    "comment_text": "I've always found \"The Giving Tree\" by Shel Silverstein to be a heartbreaking read. The story of a selfless tree that gives everything it has to help and teach a boy is such a beautiful, yet tragic, tale. When you realize the tree has given so much of itself, but the boy never truly appreciates what it has done for him, it leaves a lump in your throat. It's a reminder that sometimes we take those close to us for granted, and the importance of showing our love and gratitude.\n\n         The bittersweet ending, where the old man returns to the tree for one last hug, and the tree is relieved to know that the boy is now happy, never fails to make me tear up every time I read it. It's a story that teaches us the true meaning of love, sacrifice, and the circle of life. It's a must-read for anyone, especially for kids, as it instills",
