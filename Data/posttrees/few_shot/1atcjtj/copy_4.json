There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you?

I remember feeling like I was in John Green\u2019s world for all the days I was reading it. It was the first book I ever read that really made me feel like I was part of it, as if I was actually living in the world he had created. It was really beautiful and heartbreaking.

I haven't had a chance to read \"Legend\" by David Gemmell yet, but now I'm really intrigued to discover it. I can definitely resonate with feeling so deeply for the characters and being unable to put a book down.\n\n        2. As for my emotional reading moments, I'd say one that really stands out is the last 50 pages of \"A Prayer for Owen Meany\" by John Irving. I had been engaged in the story throughout, but those last 50 pages truly broke my heart. It's a beautiful, heart-wrenching novel, and I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful emotional reading experience.\n\n        3. It's interesting to see how different books can impact us in profound ways. If you enjoyed \"Legend,\" I'd be curious to hear what other fantasy",

The scene where Scout realizes the true nature of Boo Radley and the aftermath of Tom Robinson's death got me good.\n\n        I remember I was reading it in school, and there were a few times I had to put the book down because I was too emotional to keep going. It really hit home the injustice that still exists in the world, and the struggle for justice that people have to face.\n\n        I'd definitely recommend it to anyone, it's a classic for a reason.",

I'll have to give that one a try sometime.\n\n         Where The Red Fern Grows was definitely one of the first books to make me cry when I was a kid (I was about 8-9 when I read it). It's a beautiful story about a boy and his dogs and the bond that they develop. It's always sad when you read about a story where the main character is sad, but I can't remember ever getting so choked up about a book as that one. I think it was the first time I'd read a book where the main character was so desperate for something that he wouldn't let anything get in the way, and in the end he finally gets it, but only after sacrificing everything. Such an emotional roller coaster!\n\n         Thanks for sharing! I'm always on the lookout for new books that can take me on a ride like that.\n\n         ~An",

Sometimes, as we grow older, we gain additional layers of empathy or understanding that can make certain books truly hit us in the feels. It's amazing how a book can take us on such a vivid journey and make us feel so connected to the characters and their experiences. Even though I've only read *The Yearling* once, I remember the emotions it evoked very vividly. The book really explores themes of family, loss, and the circle of life, which can be difficult to grapple with, especially at a younger age. Reading it again may bring up those same intense feelings, but since we've gone through more experiences, we can also appreciate the book in a different way. As you said, books truly are magical!",

As for me, the book that made me cry or get choked up was \"The Giver\" by Lois Lowry. The ending of the book was really sad and emotional, and it left a big impact on me as a young reader. It was my first introduction to dystopian fiction, and I remember feeling really sad and frustrated when the main character, Jonas, had to make a difficult decision at the end. It was a powerful reminder of the importance of our choices and the consequences they can have. Have you read \"The Giver\"? What did you think of it?\n\n         Note: I apologize if my response seems a bit disjointed or impersonal.

The book follows four friends from college as they navigate their lives, but the main focus is on Jude, the most complex and troubled of the four. The story follows various aspects of Jude's life, including his sexuality, his career, and his relationships. While the book is beautifully written and full of hope, there are several scenes of intense suffering that really got to me.\n\n         Overall, I think this book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys a good tear-jerker.",

The user you're mimicking seems to have a rich history with various books, ranging from fantasy series like David Gemmell's Drenai Saga to Stephen King's most popular works. From their favorite titles, like Salem's Lot and The Shining, to their least favorites, like Revival, their reading preferences are evident. It's understandable that the end of Legend left the user more annoyed than crying, but as others have pointed out, the emotional impact of that book can be substantial for some readers. Books, after all, have a unique power to transport us to different worlds and elicit a wide range of emotions.",

The scene where the ka-tet first breaks, and Stephen King himself appears as a character, is especially powerful. Seeing the characters we've followed for thousands of pages, all of whom have gone through so much, finally coming together only to have it all torn apart is heartbreaking. It's a great reminder of the importance of cherishing the moments we have with the people we care about, because we never know when they might be taken away from us.\n\n        As a reader, I think the Dark Tower series is unique in that it manages to be at once both epic in scope and deeply personal, exploring themes of love, loss, and redemption in a way that few other works of fiction have.

It's a series I've read multiple times, and I've cried every time.\n\n         I always end up getting really attached to the characters, and that makes it hurts when they're in danger or get hurt. The author, Brandon Sanderson, is really good at writing characters that you can care about deeply, so that definitely helps. I'm also a really sensitive person, so I get pretty easily stirred up emotionally.\n\n         Of course, there are a lot of other books where the ending is sad or bittersweet, but I don't usually cry during those. I guess I just don't get as attached to the characters, or I'm more focused on the overall plot and how things turn out rather than the individual characters.\n         For",

I've cried while reading many books, but it's usually because of the emotional intensity of the situation, rather than a specific plot point. I think the book that came the closest to making me cry as an adult was The Art of Fielding by Chad Harbach. It tells the story of a small college baseball team and the lives of its players, coach, and fans.

The book shows us that even if we try to do the right thing, we may not always be able to do so, and that is something we need to keep in mind in our daily lives.\n\n         Plus, the book is beautifully written and the characters are well-developed and relatable. The author had a knack for making you feel close to the characters and care about them. It's a book that",

One example that comes to mind is the ending of Margaret Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" where Offred is finally able to escape along with Nick and the baby. It's a bittersweet moment, as she's finally able to escape the oppressive regime of Gilead, but she's also lost everything and everyone she's ever known. Another poignant moment for me was the ending of John Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men,\" where Lennie is killed and George is left alone. It's a powerful reminder of the harsh realities",

One particular scene that stood out for me was when Bryson shares the story of his friend Katz, who passed away shortly after their hiking journey. Reading about Bryson's struggles with grief and loss was deeply moving, and I found myself tearing up as I read about the friendship that had meant so much to both men.

The emotional impact of the book comes from the horrors that he experiences during the journey, such as seeing his family and friends murdered and being held as a slave. One of the most emotional scenes for me was when he arrives in a refugee camp and sees a young girl standing on a line for hours on end, waiting to be given food. He later learns that the girl died of starvation shortly after. This story was particularly impactful for me because it provided a window into a conflict that I had no prior knowledge about, and it made me appreciate the privileges that I have as a reader in a more affluent country.",

It broke my heart knowing he never wanted to trade himself for a sword, but he did it for the friends he made. Another time was in The Last Battle when Reepicheep dies. The way he goes out in battle with the other Narnian animals to fight the forces of evil one more time was so bittersweet. The thought of Aslan letting someone into Narnia for a second chance, only to lose them in the war against Tash struck me as especially tragic.

From what I know, the main character, Charlie, is a mentally disabled man who undergoes a genetic procedure to potentially increase his intelligence. At first, the procedure works and Charlie begins to learn and grow, but as time goes on, he realizes that the procedure was only temporary and he will eventually regress back to his original state. The story is told through Charlie's journals, and as his intelligence deteriorates, the reader feels his frustration, sadness, and eventual despair.

It had been a long time since I had read it, and I had forgotten much of the book. As a teenager, I had a crush on Sirius Black, so rediscovering my love for the character made me feel so many emotions. Upon the discovery that he was a prisoner of Azkaban, we learn that he was framed and betrayed by a close family friend...and it all comes flooding back. That betrayal, and the realization that Black had gone through years of hell for a crime he didn't commit, had me gripped and rooting for him throughout the book. The emotional payoff when he finally meets Harry is bittersweet, but ultimately satisfying. It made me realize that J.K Rowling was such an amazing storyteller.\n\n         For instance, the following",

It really struck a chord with me as I think we all have that sense of wanting to hold onto the people and places that feel like home. I felt such a deep sadness when saying goodbye to these characters and the world they inhabited. It was a powerful experience and one that I won't forget.",

Towards the end of the book, when there's a significant moment where he talks to a friend about love and loss, I found myself choking back tears. It was a poignant and beautiful moment that I'll always remember.",

The characters are profound and the love story between Elena and Mikhail, the protagonist, is breathtakingly romantic. The climax of the book is Elena's death, and even though I knew it was coming, the way it was written, her final thoughts, and the description of her body was enough to render me absolutely sobbing.\n\n          For those interested: Forgetting Elena is a must read. It follows Elena, a dancer whose people have the ability to forget the past and move on. One day, Elena's mother is taken by the enemy and Elena and Mikhail, a prisoner with a dark secret, must band together to save her. The story is epic, romantic, and extremely thought-provoking.

One family is white, the other black. They learn that their children have unknowingly fallen in love and had a baby together, resulting in the black son being murdered by the white father of the white girl in a fit of anger, since mixed race relationships were illegal at the time. The ending is the father of the black son trying to make peace with the father of the white daughter, only to be met with coldness and cruelty. I remember reading it and bursting into tears. I had never felt so deeply emotional about a book before reading it. It was a really impactful experience because it showed how racism ruins families and lives, and the devastation it leaves in its wake.",

I definitely relate to the feeling of not being able to put a book down because you've become so invested in the story and characters.\n\n        I remember reading \"The Outsiders\" by S.E. Hinton when I was in middle school, and I think that was the first book that really made me cry. The main characters are a group of poor guys living in a tough part of town, and everything they go through really resonated with me at the time. I remember feeling so deeply for each of them and feeling that helpless, desperate feeling along with them.\n\n        I've had similar experiences with other books since then, but \"Midnight Library\" sounds really special. It's great to know that books can offer such a profound emotional release during a difficult time.

I love how he solves complex problems and saves the world without being a military-trained operative or having superpowers. I also love how the book seamlessly combines historical facts and fictional storytelling - it feels like a real-life treasure hunt. When Miezzi, the villain, is revealed, I felt a rush of emotions - fear, sadness, and anger. His plan to destroy history and create chaos was heart-breaking, and the fact that he had infiltrated the Vatican and manipulated the cardinals to do his bidding made me feel that the whole world was no longer a safe place. But the ending gives me hope - Langdon and the villain have a face-off, and the villain's ultimate downfall comes when he underestimates",

He just got really old and something about his appearance came off as really delicate at the end, like the wings of a dragonfly (might even be an indirect quote).
