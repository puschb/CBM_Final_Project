The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

I read it when I was in high school, and the portrayal of love and loss was so raw and profound that I found myself in tears multiple times throughout the book. The ending was especially heartbreaking, and I remember feeling like I couldn't breathe afterwards. Even now, many years later, I find myself thinking about the characters and the themes of the book on a regular basis. It has definitely stayed with me.\n\n        Another book that comes to mind is \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak. Despite being a historical fiction novel, it had a surprisingly emotional impact on me. The protagonist, Liesel, is a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany, and the story follows her journey as she discovers the power of words through books. The fact that the narrator is Death",

The book was The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss, the second book in The Kingkiller Chronicle. The moment that got me really emotional was towards the end of the book, when the main character, Kvothe, loses someone very dear to him. The way it was written and the sadness Kvothe felt really resonated with me and I found myself getting choked up while reading. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a new fantasy to read.\n\n            For those interested in the book, here's a link to it on Amazon: https://amzn.to/39yJZzG\n\n            and I didn't realize it at the time, but the post mentions the book as The Name of the Wind, so I should have been more specific.

In 'The Book Thief' by Markus Zusak, there is a particular scene where the narrator, Death, explains the origin of his involvement with the story's protagonist, Liesel Meminger. Death mentions that he follows all souls that are destined to die, and that he often accompanies them to the place where they are to be buried, such as a graveyard or a mass grave. As he follows Liesel to her burial, Death reflects on how he has always known when a soul is about to be taken, but Liesel is different. He admits that he feels a deep affection for her, and that she has made him question whether his purpose is to take life or to protect it. The scene is particularly poignant because it serves as a reminder of the fragility and preciousness of life, and it is a poignant goodbye from the author to the story's protagonist.",

I hope you enjoy it, as I found it to be a very unique and thought-provoking book.\n\n         For the original post, it was interesting to read \"Legend\" by David Gemmell and it is definitely a book that had memorable moments for many readers. It's always fascinating to hear about the books that touch us deeply and resonate with us, evoking a range of emotions from sadness to joy. The first book that truly resonated with me in that regard was \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee, as it touched on themes of justice, empathy, and childhood innocence that left a lasting impact on me.",

I cried so much because I knew how much he loved his dogs and how much he was missing them while they were gone. Also, in a twist worthy of Charles Dickens himself, the guy who trained the dogs was a total jerk, and I was so happy when the main character figured that out, even though that meant that I was crying all over again.\n\n         I actually really enjoyed the movie, but I remember watching it as a kid and being shocked at how different the book was. I was so young when I read it that I didn't think much of the differences, but I recently reread it as an adult and was really surprised by how different it was. For example, in the",

As a kid, it was hard to understand the racial climate at the time, but it definitely made me empathize for the characters and really think about the message of the book.\n\nIt was one of my first realistic and deep encounters with literature, so it definitely made an impact on me as a reader. I don't remember ever crying while reading it, but it's definitely a strong and emotional novel.",

It was the first book in the series, and the main character, Thomas, was faced with the loss of his best friend, and the realization that nobody was coming to rescue them from the Glade. The ending of the book was unexpected and heartbreaking, and I remember feeling so sad for days afterwards. It's still one of my favorite series, and I've reread it multiple times, but that ending always hits me hard.\n\n         For me, the most emotional I've ever been in a book has to be \"The Night Circus\" by Erin Morgenstern. The chemistry between the two main characters was so palpable, and I was so invested in their romance that when things took a turn for the worse, I was absolutely devastated.\n\n         As an aside, I also cried while reading \"To Kill a Mocking",

The ending was very poignant and left me with a sense of melancholy.\n\n         I've read the series multiple times and every time it's been just as impactful. It's one of my favorite series and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark, emotionally heavy, and epic fantasy.\n\n         Although I don't cry often while reading, there are few books that get under my skin and stay with me long after I've closed the covers. The Dark Tower is definitely one of those books. It's a series that stays with me, and I'll continue to return to it whenever I need a good cry.\n\n         If you haven't read the series yet, I highly recommend it.

It was a very powerful moment and hit me hard. I'm a very emotional person while reading, so a lot of books make me cry, but this was one of the early ones.\n\n         The second book in the trilogy is when I really fell in love with the series.

The separation was heart-wrenching, and I distinctly remember putting the book down and taking a moment to cry. I think what made it more affecting for me was that, by this point, I had developed a deep attachment to these characters and their story, and the pain of separation was more real for me because of that.

It was also one of the first books I read after coming out, so it did a lot more for me emotionally since the two main characters are bisexual.\n\n        2. The Song of Achilles, Madeline Miller - the last chapter. I had to pause for a minute when it was all over. It felt real, and it was gut wrenching.\n\n        3. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, J.K. Rowling - the ending. I cried and cried for hours afterward. No other book had ever done that to me before, and no other book has since. I remember thinking, \"If I never read another book in my life, I\u2019d be satisfied. This book is perfect.\"\n        4",

The main character struggles with not being able to stay with her because he travels in time, and the book follows their journey of trying to be together in the future. One part that really got me is when the main character travels back to their shared childhood, and his wife has already grown up and he can't even know her as a child since she is a grown woman in the future. It really tugged at my heart strings, and it was a beautiful book overall.\n\n         Another book that made me teary-eyed is \"The House on Mango Street\" by Sandra Cisneros.

So now I have kind of a cavalier attitude towards death. It was definitely influenced by the books I was reading, though - I remember feeling kind of excited when the first character died, because they could come back in the next book.

The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back.

It's interesting that we both cried during different moments in the story. I was also 12 when I first read it and remember being in tears on the last pages. I must have reread that book at least 20 times throughout my teenage years just to relive that emotion. The Amber Spyglass will always be one of my favorite books.

I was also around the age of 12, so I'm sure that added to the impact.\n\n         Another book that has had a lasting impact on me, and where I remember shedding a tear or two, was The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini. There's a moment towards the end of the book that I won't spoil here, but it's a powerful scene that really illustrates the themes of guilt, redemption, and the complexities of human relationships.\n\n         I'm always happy to hear about books that moved other people, so keep those recommendations coming!",

I haven't had the chance to read them yet, but they're definitely on my list.\n\n         For me, the first book that made me cry or get choked up was The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern. The ending was just so bittersweet, and I couldn't help but feel a lump in my throat as I turned the final page. I also teared up a bit while reading A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman, especially when he describes the moment when Ove realizes he no longer hates people. It's a beautiful moment, and really showcases the transformative power of love and friendship. \ud83e\udd14\n\n         What",

The book is split into two parts: the first is Sal telling her story; the second introduces us to her grandmother, who is on her way to visit Sal. As the story unfolds, we learn of her father's secrets and how they have affected her mother's life, as well as the life of her grandmother.\n\n        When I first read the book, I connected deeply with Sal,",

Being a fan of Truman Capote and having read his other works, I was curious what he might have to offer in true crime.\n\n         When I began the book, I wasn't expecting much from a literary point of view since it isn't a novel, but I figured it would still be interesting.\n\nBut I was blown away by the writing, the in-depth research and the compassionate yet brutal detailing of the events.\n\nI didn't realize until I was halfway through that I had started crying and that I was choking up with each new detail of the crime or the lives of the people involved, and especially as the investigators and the Clutter family found out more about the killers.\n\nIt was a really powerful and emotional reading experience for me, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to read",

You're introduced to Rose as this feisty, independent character who's willing to take on the world, and then before you know it, she's gone. It's just unfortunate, because she's really grown on you by that point and you're rooting for her. It definitely left an impact and made me realize how much emotions can be evoked through a simple story and characters. I'll never forget that moment.\n\n         If you haven't read the rest of the series, I highly recommend it. It's a wonderful read and Redwall is one of the best examples of the classic fantasy series that I've come across. The whole series is filled with great characters and interesting stories.

Harry Dresden, the main character, is a private investigator who just so happens to be a wizard. I loved his sarcastic sense of humor, and how he balances between being a wise-cracking detective and a powerful sorcerer.\n        But the thing that really sealed the deal for me was the world-building.

It is a short novel that tells the story of Charlie, a man with an IQ of 68 who lives in an institution for the mentally challenged. He undergoes an experimental surgery that increases his intelligence, and the story chronicles his journey and eventual realization of the limitations of his new intelligence. The novel ends tragically, with Charlie descending back to his previous level of intelligence after the surgery wears off. The sadness and poignancy of the book comes from the reader's awareness of Charlie's limited understanding of the world and his own condition, and the sense of loss as he is returned to his former state. The novel offers a powerful critique of the limitations of intelligence and the challenges faced by those with intellectual disabilities.",

Personally, I'd say the first book that made me cry or get choked up was The Hunger Games. I really connected with Katniss and the struggles she faced, and the scene where Prim was first chosen was definitely tough to read. It was just the reality of that situation and how it could easily have been me that was selected that really hit home. Reading it the first time, I had to put the book down and give myself a moment to compose myself.\n\n        I can see how the scene with the kitten in The Ocean at the End of the Lane could be upsetting, but I was more affected by the supernatural elements of the story and the reconnection with the protagonist's childhood and the memories it brought back. For me, it was the feeling of nostalgia and loss that moved me the most",

As a child, it was one of those few books that I managed to relate to in a deeper way than most, and I think that had to do with the magical world of Fantasien. The idea of a book that could exist independently of us, with its own characters and story, is still something that captivates me. Plus, the themes of loss, longing, and the power of imagination are some that I've always found deeply touching. But I really teared up when I learned about the Nothing, which is this ominous force that's constantly devouring Fantasien, and how it threatens to destroy it entirely.

It was really heartbreaking to see everything go so wrong for them.\n\n         For me, a book that makes me cry is \"The Fault in Our Stars\" by John Green. The ending is so sad and poignant, and I always end up crying when I read it. It's a beautiful and moving story about love, life, and loss.\n\n         Another book that made me cry is",

I remember feeling such a mix of sympathy for him, anger at his family for putting him in that situation, and relief that he was finally out in the open where he could be himself and not have to hide anymore. It was a really powerful book for me at that age, and even though I still have that copy, I've lost the ability to read it with the same innocence I had when I was younger.

While it's a sweet story, it can also be read as a metaphor for selflessness, and it can make me teary-eyed when I remember how much time and love the tree gives to the boy, even as he takes more and more without giving anything back.

The memoir provides an incredible look at life in Ireland during the 1930s, particularly in the small, rural towns. The protagonist, Frank McCourt, details his upbringing with his alcoholic father and large family in a poverty-stricken environment.\n\n         The most emotional part of the book is undoubtedly when McCourt's younger brother Malachy dies after ingesting battery acid in a failed attempt to pass off counterfeit money. The book is filled with heart-wrenching moments, but this particular scene stuck with me because of the raw emotion McCourt conveys, as well as the deep impact it left on his psyche. A tragic but important read, I definitely recommend Angela's Ashes to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of Ireland's past or simply looking for an intensely",

I read it when I was around 12 years old, and I was already a reasonably competent reader, though there were definitely parts that went over my head at the time.

To this day, I can't read or even think of it without feeling a lump in my throat.

His last words, \"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known,\" really struck a chord with me, as it showcases the power of sacrifice and the importance of living for others, even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.

But the first book that really got me, that made me cry, was \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman. It's about an old, grumpy man named Ove who has lost the will to live. But as the story unfolds, you learn why he's so grumpy, and you see him start to open up, and it's just so beautiful. The ending is just perfect. It's one of those books that I've recommended to everyone I know.",

Hazel's struggle with coming to terms with her mortality and finding meaning in her life, as well as the tender and moving romantic relationship between Hazel and Augustus, made me emotional throughout the whole book. The book's conclusion was particularly heart-wrenching and led to me shedding a few tears.

It was incredibly relatable for me as a young girl, and the end of the book where Jo sells her manuscript to get money for a family member in need really broke my heart. It's still one of my favorite books to this day and I often find myself tearing up while reading it.\n\n         For another emotional moment in a book, I can recommend \"Code Name Verity\" by Elizabeth Wein. It's a historical fiction novel set during World War II, and it's a gripping story about two girls who are members of the British Special Operations Executive. One of them gets captured, and the other writes her story to explain what happened and why she's still alive. It's a heart-wrenching story that will stay with you long after you've finished reading it. I highly recommend it!\n\n         Happy reading!",
