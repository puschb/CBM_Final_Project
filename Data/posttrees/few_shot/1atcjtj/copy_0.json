    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

Druss is a steadfast and unwavering character, and his unwavering focus on rescuing his wife shows the power of love and determination, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. The book also explores the bonds between friends and the sacrifices they make for each other, which hit close to home for me. Plus, there's a dog that plays a significant role in the story, and I'm sucker for dogs in books. So yeah, that's my emotional moment in reading.

The main character, Landon, who was previously uncaring and self-centered, learns to appreciate the love of his life, Jamie, who is terminally ill. However, on the day of her funeral, he finds out that she confessed her love for him just moments before her death. Landon is devastated, and the reader can feel his pain and regret. I remember having to put the book down and take a break to compose myself because it was just too much to handle. It was the first book that made me cry and it will always be a special novel to me.",

The scene at the end where Owen Meany is found dead and his friend, Johnny, is trying to come to terms with it, is particularly moving. For me, it's the way Irving skillfully builds the relationship between the two characters over the course of the book, and the emotional impact that Owen Meany has on those around him, that makes it such a powerful read.\n\n        Another book that I remember getting choked up over is \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee. The courtroom scenes where Tom Robinson is on trial are still etched in my memory and the ending of the book, with Scout's realization of the true nature of humanity, is poignant and thought-provoking.\n\n        What about you?

As for a book that made me cry unexpectedly as a full-grown adult, that's a tough one. I don't know if I've had that experience yet, but I do recall tearing up during parts of Interview With the Vampire by Anne Rice and The Road by Cormac McCarthy. But the book that's been closest to making me cry uncontrollably lately is A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving.

Despite the bleak subject matter, the book is also filled with moments of hope, love, and humanity that make it a classic. Another book that made me emotional was the short story \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\" by Ursula K. Le Guin. This story presents a utopian society, but at the cost of an innocent child suffering terribly. The story forces the reader to question the nature of happiness and the true cost of creating a perfect life for some, at the expense of others. These books are not light reads, but they are thought-provoking and incredibly impactful.\"",

That said, the entire book is just heartbreaking in ways I can't really put into words. I cried my eyes out at the very last line, and it still gets to me when I think back to it.\n\n         Another book that really got me was The Deathly Hallows by J.K. Rowling. I know it's the last book in the Harry Potter series, and it feels like it's just full of tension and emotional moments from start to finish. Notably, the \"Kreacher's Memory\" chapter is a real gut-punch.\n\n         More recently,",

There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved.\n\n        It was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so",

I loved dogs, and the idea of having my own pair of hunting dogs really appealed to me. The book was very descriptive, and I could visualize everything very clearly in my head.\n\n        The parts that made me cry were the parts where Billy had to train the dogs, and when they were finally fully trained and ready for their first hunt. But then, as most people know, one of the dogs gets killed. I remember being devastated when that happened, and it took me a long time to be able to read that part again without tearing up.\n\n        Even years later, I still remember the feeling of that book, and how it made me feel about the bond between a person and their dog.

The last page was a real gut punch, and I didn't know what to think for a while after I finished the series. It was a fitting end to an epic journey, but I felt like there was more to be said. I've re-read it since then, and it never stops being a powerful and emotional read. The Dark Tower series is one of my all-time favorites, and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly unique and thought-provoking story.",

I'm gonna have to jump the gun here and say that for me, it was A Song of Ice and Fire. I won't give any specific spoilers, but there's a certain moment towards the middle of the series that leaves the reader speechless. A lot of people dismiss it as melodramatic, but I don't think they appreciated the emotional payoff. Just remember, we do not weep for the wicked or the whiny \u2013 only for the fallen hero. It's the unexpected moments that really get to us, and George R.R. Martin knows how to wring every tear.\n\n        ))) That said, in terms of your emotional moments when reading books, I feel more of a connection to the characters when they're confronted with the realities of the world they're in.

The story of a little pig named Wilbur and his unlikely, yet incredibly close, friendship with a spider named Charlotte is such a moving tale of companionship and kindness. The moment that really got me was when Charlotte had to leave Wilbur, knowing that he would be sent off to the butcher. The way she spun the words \"Some Pig\" in her web as a final farewell still brings tears to my eyes. It teaches such an important lesson about the value of friendship and the impact one being can have on another. I think it's a great book for any age, as it's simple enough for children to understand but also has enough depth to appeal to adults as well.",

When I actually read it at around the same age as you, I was completely engrossed in it. I remember it being a big deal in school as well, so I felt like I was in on something special when I read it. I also remember being really affected by the ending, especially since it was my first real encounter with death in a book. I still think about that book fondly, it was a very formative read for me. It's amazing how much a book can stick with you over the years, even if you haven't picked it up since.",

The way the book deals with themes like friendship, loss, and growing up might have struck a chord with me at that time, making me appreciate the story even more.

It's a story about friendship, loyalty, and the hard realization that not everything is always as safe and magical as we'd like it to be. It's definitely a book that can bring tears to the eyes not just of the readers, but of the parents as well. It's heartbreaking to see the bond between the main characters and their imagined world, Terabithia, torn apart, especially since they're so young. I think the impact on the audience makes the story even more powerful. I think that's why it's had such a lasting impact on so many readers, whether they first read it as a child or an adult.

Here is one of my recent moments: It was from the book \"The Night Circus\" by Erin Morgenstern. The characters had been going through so much, and there was a scene where the main character had to watch his mentor meet his end. The emotion and build-up in that moment was so raw and powerful, it left me feeling choked up. It's a beautiful and magical book, and I highly recommend it. What about you? Have you ever had a moment like that while reading a book?",

The book is about a girl named Sal, who goes to visit her grandmothers' family in their rural town. Throughout the book, Sal tells two different stories: one about a summer she spent with her mother in California before moving in with her grandparents, and one about a trip her grandmothers took years ago. These stories are woven together, and it's not until the very end of the book that the relationships between the characters are fully revealed. The book is beautifully written, and the way the stories come together is so touching and poignant. I can still remember feeling like I was holding my breath waiting to see how everything would resolve, and when it finally did, I was completely overwhelmed with emotion.

I bawled for a good 10 minutes. It's a beautiful book, and it's definitely worth a read if you haven't already.\n\n         For the record, I've read all of David Gemmell's Drenai saga, and while Legend was great, it wasn't the one that hit me emotionally. It was actually \"Waylander\" that did it, and it had to do with the ending. Spoilers below: [Spoiler](#s \"When Waylander returns to the village where he was raised, knowing he would be killed, and saying goodbye to his mother. I bawled.\")\n\n         As for other books, \"A Walk to Remember\"",

The story is about a young girl named Liesel Meminger who is sent to live with a foster family in Nazi Germany during World War II.

One of the most emotional moments in the book for me was when Liesel's foster father, Hans Hubermann, is arrested by the Nazis for helping Jews. This scene is particularly heart-wrenching because Hans is a kind and compassionate person who values books and learning, and is punished for his beliefs. Liesel is devastated by Hans' arrest and it serves as a turning point in the story, illustrating the horrors of Nazi Germany and the lengths people will go to resist it.

It's not your typical sci-fi novel, but rather a deeply emotional and thought-provoking story about a man named Charlie, who is intellectually disabled and undergoes an experimental surgery that increases his intelligence.

Both of these parts make me cry, but particularly the latter, as it reminds me of how unfair life can be and how fleeting happiness can be.\n\n        Additionally, the ending of Flowers for Algernon is one of the saddest in literature, as you know that Charlie will never be able to hold onto the happiness and knowledge he gained through the surgery. I think that's what makes it such a powerful story - it shows the harsh realities of life in a way that is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking.\n\n        Another book that comes to mind, although",

Books like The Kite Runner, The Fault in Our Stars, and A Man Called Ove have all made me feel a strong emotional connection to the characters and the story.

The moment where >!Harry loses his wand!< still makes me tear up to think about it.\n\n          On a different note, I also love sad books and I'll admit to having shed a tear or two over \"A Monster Calls\" by Patrick Ness as well. It's a fantastic and moving story that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a book that will make them feel the feels.",

These events are so severe that they're hard to read, and the emotional impact is very intense. I was constantly on the edge of my seat, worrying about what was going to happen next.\n\n         Second, the book is written in such a way that the reader feels very close to the characters, and I found myself caring deeply about them. I could empathize with their struggles and root for them to get through their difficulties.\n\n         The ending of the book was especially sad, and it left me feeling emotionally drained and needing time to process everything I had just read.

George Orwell's allegorical novel about a group of rebellious animals trying to form their own society is still incredibly relevant today. In this age of disinformation and propaganda, I feel the story of Napoleon the pig is more than just a fable; it's a cautionary tale on totalitarian leadership and the dangers of misinformation. The imagery in the book is masterfully crafted, and I",

It's a science-fiction novel that explores some heavy themes about time, love, loss, and grief. The protagonist, Kate, meets a mysterious figure who gives her the ability to travel through time. She uses this power to try and save her husband's life, but in doing so, she unwittingly changes the course of events in ways she can't foresee. The emotional impact of the book comes from the fact that Kate's actions have far-reaching consequences, and it's never clear whether she's doing the right thing or not. The ending is bittersweet and the final scene in particular made me tear up a little.\n\n         I also have to give a shoutout to",

He has been kind and loving to Liesel, and his death is a huge loss for her.\n        The scene is described in great detail, and as I read it, I felt a lump in my throat and tears welling up in my eyes.

Her death was such a shock, and it definitely tugged at my heartstrings. I re-read the book a couple of years ago and it still brought tears to my eyes.\n\n         The emotional impact of a book is always dependent on your personal connection to the characters and the story, but for me, Beth's death was a powerful moment that really resonated.\n\n         For others, it could be a different character, a different book, or a different moment in the story.

The Book Thief is a powerful and moving story that has stayed with me since I read it many years ago.\n         <<COMMENT COMMENT>>\n         I couldn't agree more!

She learns to read with the help of her foster father, and becomes obsessed with books, even stealing them to add to her collection. As the war progresses and the Nazi regime becomes increasingly oppressive, Liesel's life becomes increasingly dangerous. From what I've gather, the book deals with themes of loss, perseverance, and the power of words, so it's not hard to imagine that it would be a very emotional read.

There's a twist in the story that just completely broke my heart, and it's not until the very end that you learn the full impact of it.

The first dog unfortunately gets loose and falls into a river, and I believe another hound also runs off and is never recovered.

Throughout the book, she meets and falls in love with a fellow cancer patient, Augustus, who's lost part of a leg to Osteosarcoma. The story deals with themes of love, loss, and living in the face of death, and towards the end, the pair discusses what it means to \"irreplaceable.\" At first, Hazel tells Gus that because no one can replace the loved ones they've lost, they're irreplaceable.

It's a coming-of-age story about a girl named Delia, who is grappling with her father's terminal illness and the loss of her closest friend. The writing is so beautiful and emotional that it really pulled on my heartstrings.\n\n         Specifically, there's a scene where Delia and her father are out for a walk, and she's talking to him about her dead friend. Her dad responds by telling her about a childhood memory he has of a friend of his own who passed away, and the way he describes it just makes you feel so sad for him. I remember reading that scene and feeling utterly heartbroken.\n\n         Another book that made me cry was \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" by Stephen Chbosky. It's a story about a freshman in high school named Charlie, who",
