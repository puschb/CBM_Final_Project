    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

She attends a support group for teenagers with cancer where she meets a boy named Augustus Waters. They develop a relationship and go on an adventure together to find a reclusive author. The book is about their love story and deals with themes of death, illness, and the human condition. The ending is very tragic and it was the first book that made me cry because I felt so emotionally invested in the characters and their story.\n\n          Another book that made me cry was \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman. It's a story about an old man named Ove who has lost his wife and is struggling to cope with his grief. He forms an unlikely friendship with a young family that moves in next door and the story follows their journey of understanding each",

The main characters, Hazel and Gus, are in love with each other, and both have terminal illnesses. They have to navigate their relationship while both facing death and the harsh realities of their illnesses. There are many moments throughout the book that will leave you sobbing. I personally found myself crying through most of the last 100 pages. I think it will hit a lot of the same emotional beats as A Prayer for Owen Meany.\n\n         \u200b",

The book takes place during World War Two and the protagonist, Liesel, is a young girl who comes to foster with a new family. She's illiterate and they offer her books to learn how to read. Throughout the book, Liesel forms strong bonds with her foster parents, the Jewish man they're hiding, and even the Nazi bookseller she steals books from.\n\n         One of the most heartbreaking moments for me was when Liesel's foster father, Hans, died. He had been sick for a while and the family knew it was imminent, but it still hits very hard when it happens. It's especially heartbreaking because Liesel is still a child and it's her first real experience with death. It's a great book with so many emotional scenes, but that one in particular always gets to me.",

I remember getting to the end of the book \"A Little Princess\" by Frances Hodgson Burnett and sobbing because little Sara never got the happy ending she deserved. Another one that I remember, probably not the first, but certainly a very memorable one is \"The Fault in Our Stars\" by John Green. The ending of that book hit me so hard, and I couldn't help but feel like I was suffocating in a cloud of emotional turmoil. Even thinking about it now brings up memories of the book and I can't help but tear up. It's such a beautiful, heartbreaking, and unforgettable book.

It was assigned as one of the short chapters in my elementary school's reading program, and even though I struggled a bit with the vocabulary, the beautiful story quickly had me hooked.\n         The story revolves around a young boy named Billy, who dreams of owning a pair of coonhounds and going on hunting adventures with them. After much determination and saving, he eventually buys his first dog, Old Dan. After some time, he buys a second dog, Little Ann, and together the three of them have many exciting adventures.\n         However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that Billy's adventures are not going to be the safe and happy ones he had imagined. The dogs are used for illegal dog fights, but they always come out on top. Unfortunately, Billy's dream of a happy life with his dogs is shattered when Old Dan is",

It had a lot of emotional moments, but the one that stood out the most was when Old Dan and Little Ann died. I still read that book every couple of years, I've had the book since I was a kid, just reading one of my favorite passages - \"That was a long time ago. And I obviously can't replace Little Ann or Old Dan. I could always buy another dog. The real treasures are people. You realize that as you get older.\" - brings a tear to my eye still.\n\n         Another book I'd like to mention was \"Goodnight Mister Tom\" by Michelle Magorian. Although I read it more recently, it was still an impactful read. Especially at the end of the book and the final paragraph",

It's a beautiful and heartbreaking story about the power of words, love, and friendship. Towards the end of the book, Liesel and her foster father are hiding a Jew in their home, and their family is discovered and taken away. Liesel is taken to a concentration camp and eventually dies.

It's a young adult/middle grade novel about two children, a boy with a genetic mutation that makes him age faster than normal and a girl, both of whom are outcasts. While the rest of their community sees them as useless or a curse, they slowly become friends and go on an adventure together, forming a bond that helps them come to terms with their situations. There's a scene towards the end where they part ways, but promise to meet up again when they're ready. The boy is so old that his friends have forgotten him, and the girl can't reveal that she's been meeting with him for fear of being persecuted. The scene where they say goodbye, knowing they might never see each other again, was incredibly sad and I couldn't help but tear up.\n\n        For another example, \"The Graveyard Book\" by Neil Gaim",

It's a beautiful and heart-wrenching story about a boy dealing with his mother's terminal cancer, told through a mix of prose and illustrations. I read it when I was in high school, and although it was a difficult read, it really made me think and feel a lot about life, loss, and the importance of friendship and family.

The story of a pig named Wilbur and the friendship he formed with a spider named Charlotte was so touching and beautiful. The moment that really got to me was when Charlotte died, and Wilbur realized the sacrifice she had made for him. It was a really poignant moment that made me feel both sad and happy at the same time. It was a great lesson about friendship and the cycle of life.\n\n         Another book that moved me a lot was the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins. The end of Mockingjay, when Katniss is standing on top of the train with Peeta, was incredibly emotional. The idea of giving up everything for someone you love is such a powerful and moving concept.",

The novel is set during World War II in Nazi Germany, and it follows the story of a young girl named Liesel Meminger who is sent to live with a foster family. Throughout the story, Liesel develops a love for books and uses her reading as a means of escape from the oppressive world around her. As the story progresses, Liesel becomes close with the foster family and the Jewish man they are hiding in their basement. Despite knowing the ultimate outcome of the war and the characters' fates, the emotional journey and the relationships that Liesel develops are still incredibly moving, especially considering the backdrop of such a tragic period in history. It truly is a masterpiece of a book that left me both in tears and contemplating the nature of humanity.",

Her story reminds you to never take that which is dear for granted, and the ending when she triumphs and the story is brought full circle is very moving.\n\n        Another book that had a big impact on me was \"The Giving Tree\" by Shel Silverstein. That story still makes me choke up, even as an adult. The idea of giving, and the bond between a little girl and a tree, really hits home. The illustrations are simple, but they tell a powerful story about giving, love, and the connection between beings.\n\n        Have you read either of",

The story is about a young girl named Sara, who is sent to England to live with a cruel aunt after her father goes off to war. Sara's life becomes increasingly difficult and she is mistreated by the aunt, but she never loses her spirit and her hope that she will be reunited with her father.

You've clearly done your homework on this one.\n\n        For those who may be unfamiliar with the background of \"Bridge to Terabithia\", you are absolutely right to point out the tragic and poignant backstory of its author. Katherine Paterson wrote the book as a way of confronting her own grief after losing a close friend's child in an accident.\n\n        I also read \"Bridge to Terabithia\" when I was around the same age as the users in this thread, and the vivid imagery and emotional impact it had on me have stuck with me ever since.

The book starts with her moving to a small town and forming a friendship with a boy named Micah before it all starts to unravel. There are multiple emotional scenes throughout the book, but the one that gets me every time is their conversation over the phone in the chapter \"The Phone Call.\" I won't give too much away, but Nastya tells Micah that she's not coming to visit him as she had planned, and they both struggle to say what they truly want to say.

The main character, Charlie, is a man with an intellect similar to a child who is part of an experiment designed to help him become more intelligent. The story follows his rise in intelligence, his struggles, and his eventual decline back to where he was before the experiment. It's a heartbreaking and thought-provoking story. I've reread it multiple times and it never fails to make me cry.\n        For a more recent book, I would say Station Eleven. The novel is set in a world where a flu pandemic has wiped out 99% of the world's population, and follows several characters and storylines that converge. One particular scene that sticks with me is when the main character, Kirsten, is trying to perform a play for a group of survivors, but the characters start falling unconscious from carbon monoxide poisoning. It's such a powerful",

For me, the book that has made me cry the most is \"A Thousand Splendid Suns\" by Khaled Hosseini. The story follows two Afghan women who are connected by their shared experiences in a male-dominated society, and it was heartbreaking to read about the struggles they face and the sacrifices they make. I found myself shedding tears on multiple occasions while reading this book. I can completely understand how you felt when reading \"Legend\" - emotions can be very powerful in fiction, especially when we become deeply invested in the characters. If you haven't already, I highly recommend giving \"A Thousand Splendid Suns\" a read - it's a truly moving story.",

The story follows a man with an intellectually disability who undergoes a medical procedure to increase his intelligence. The story is unique because it's told chronologically, but the chapters are revisited and get progressively shorter as the protagonist's intelligence decreases over time. It's a very powerful and emotional story that explores themes of intelligence, humanity, and the nature of consciousness. I think the book is especially poignant today as we continue to learn more about intellectual disabilities and the importance of treating all people with dignity and respect.\n         Another book that made me cry is A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. The story follows four close friends who are struggling to find their place in the world. The fourth and main character, Jude, has suffered immense trauma and struggles with depression and PTSD. The book is long and detailed, and there are many moments",

In this scene, our unnamed narrator is recounting a memory from his childhood where his family had just moved to a new house and he meets Lettie, the girl who lived next door. The two of them bond over their shared love of fairy tales and imaginative play. There is a scene later in the book where they are walking in the woods together and Lettie goes to get something from her house, but she doesn't return. The narrator frantically searches for her and finally finds her lifeless body under the car of a man who was walking by. The narrator's grief is palpable throughout the rest of the book and I found myself tearing up multiple times as I read it. The image of L",

However, as the title suggests, tragic events are inevitable, and the ending of the book is heartbreaking.

The constant pressure and desire to marry in order to secure her financial future leads to her downfall. As she struggles, the reader sees the emotional toll it takes on her, and her eventual tragic end is a heartbreaking reminder of the limitations placed on women's choices and opportunities. The novel's exploration of societal expectations and the destructive consequences of not conforming to them has stayed with me, as it offers a profound commentary on the human condition and the power dynamics of the time.\u300b",

The protagonist is a 13-year-old boy named Torak who becomes a shamanic hunter on a quest to find his father, who was cursed by the ghost of an evil witch-queen.

I can definitely understand why that book would be so memorable and emotional for you, especially at such a young age. Thank you for sharing your emotional moment of reading with us!",

It tells the story of a china rabbit named Edward Tulane who is thrown overboard on a family vacation and goes on a journey to find his way back home. Throughout the book, Edward meets a variety of characters who each teach him valuable lessons about love, compassion, and the importance of cherishing the people and things in our lives. The scenes of loss and longing in the book are incredibly powerful and will definitely make you tear up. I highly recommend it!",

The novel is set during the Great Depression and follows the story of a young man named Jacob who works as a veterinarian with a traveling circus. I was a huge fan of circuses as a child, and the setting of the novel brought back many fond memories. However, the novel also explores themes of mistreatment and abuse of animals, which is something I have a strong emotional connection to. During one scene in particular, a tiger is being mistreated and a heart rending event takes place causing me to become very emotional.

There were so many moments that really tugged at my heartstrings, but the scene that really got me was when Feyre confronts Rhysand about his past and they have a heartfelt talk. It was a really emotional moment, and I found myself tearing up because I could feel their pain and the love they had for each other, even if they were both still struggling with themselves and their feelings.\n\n         It was the first time I've felt so emotionally invested in a book, and it made me eager to read the rest of the series.",
