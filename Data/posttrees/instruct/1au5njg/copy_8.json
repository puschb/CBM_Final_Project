    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

They\u2019re short though so I think I\u2019d prefer audio or ebook over print!",

I loved it and was super excited to put it on the shelf in the halls too. I'm actually sad I have lost that book on move and can't ever put it back up anymore. I have no doubt you will have a fantastic experience and get the most out of it that you can, even if that means you take a break or read it over time.",

I didn't really pay any attention to the cover until I finished it and I looked it over, and one word on the cover popped out. SAD. I don't know why I had the feeling that it referred to the people in the book. Maybe it was because I'd been in a low place myself but when I looked into the story of the people, I felt like that label really stuck out because it fit, I guess? Not a lot of things out there say the word \"sad\" on the cover, they'll either phrase it as \"the power of sadness\" or something or say it out",

He manages to get free & the only thing that lets him keep the chain with him are the holes for his hands. The main character has seen it all & is about to go into retirement. 4. He goes to 1893 to attend a symposium to talk about writing science fiction. When he returns to 1973 he finds all this happened to him as a result of a hallucinogenic drug he was taking in a commune",
