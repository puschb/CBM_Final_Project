    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

So many great turns of phrase and one-liners in his books. Plus he had the ability to write in different styles and genres. Some of his historical fiction and detective novels are underrated IMO",

But the way he combines humor and tragedy is so well written. I think he wrote the best scene in literature (not by a YA/Young Adult writer) in one of his novels. And I never read YA before he came along (I\u2019m a grown man!). For me it\u2019s just too simple to enjoy. (But there\u2019s plenty of books for grown folks like us.) It\u2019s like you\u2019re reading something from a teenager, not the best writer in the world. For me, TFIOS and Paper Towns were the ones that showed me that good writing and good storytelling can be fun, without having to be pretentious and boring.",

I was so disappointed about the book, I could not look at it properly after reading it...I'm not sure what it is that keeps stopping it from becoming a movie, but if I was a gambling man, I'd guess that the issue was the source material's unflinching portrayal of a disgusting human being who refuses to do anything constructive with his life other than consume a grosstrogeous amount of food while engaging in absolutely insane behavior, so most studios either don't know what to do with it...or fear it will not generate enough buzz to",

If ever there was a book that made me laugh, made me laugh hard, then made me feel stupid for laughing alone on a public train, then it\u2019s this one. I read the whole thing through tears of laughter and had to pause halfway through reading because I was laughing so hard when trying to read it while out for a walk. The book definitely has that humour that\u2019s so dry that it makes your laugh.",

They're sort of an apples and oranges situation, and I can't speak to the later books by Adams since the only one I've ever read is the first. What I mean here is that they're two very similar concepts, but Pratchett is doing satire about the real world, often about the state of things in his own small country, and Adams does a lot in his universe that's just plain bizarre. I love both series, but there's no way in hell I could compare the two. I don't think I can compare, say, Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy to the Discworld series. The Discworld series, like Disc",

You're not the only one who was caught off guard by how funny it can be! The first time I read it I didn't find it all that funny and I didn't really get it. I read her again a decade later or so and absolutely laughed my ass off, including out loud. Such a great book.",
