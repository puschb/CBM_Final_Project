    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

I was staying at my grandparent\u2019s house when I started the book, and they ended up asking me if I was crying. I hadn\u2019t even realized. I loved this book so much that I made a special request to the school I worked at to add a movie version to our video library at work. And even though they said no, everyone who watched it requested it again the next year.",

I'd love to be able to read a first time Bertie. I've read Wodehouse when I'm just exhausted too- sometimes it's the perfect kind of distraction, or I need something light so that I can just let my mind rest for a while.",

The ideas felt solid, but a lot of the writing felt very weird/awkward/weird. I was still entertained, but so little of the novel flowed properly. In a sense, I didn't like the style enough to enjoy his story, especially when at times his characters became so two-dimensional with such awkward writing that there felt like there was minimal thought put into their dialogues with each other. I enjoyed the premise, but it is not something that felt like it could have been done better because then I wouldn't be reading something that was so interesting. I am glad I read it and plan to re-read it, but only because I want to see if I can get the whole thing out of it because it is so frustrating to read it when the story doesn't",

The book was a history of The Bubonic Plague. I didn't get to read more than 8-10 lines in the book before I felt ill and had to put the book down. The book described the Bubonic Plague in graphic -- and I'm not talking about the horror story of the disease itself, which was bad enough -- but I've never felt so ill from reading a book. I'm still haunted by that damn book! So to this day I avoid books on the Bubonic Plague (or any other viral plague).",

I laughed out loud many times reading them! I read a lot of non fiction, fantasy and science fiction. The only fiction I really read is historical fiction or fiction that feels like real life. I wouldn't necessarily call my fave fiction book funny though. I'm going to say 'A short history' wins the funnies contest.",
