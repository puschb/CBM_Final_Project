    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

I don\u2019t need every book I read to hit the depths of the human heart like The Stranger, for instance. His humor often takes center stage but there\u2019s good themes under it all.

I\u2019m so, so tired of books where the woman is constantly being pursued by unfeeling, uncommunicative men (the very worst being in SJM\u2019s books, and some others). I don\u2019t hate fantasy romance, I just hate the same thing over and over again. I wanted to read Clockwork Boys by T Kingfester to see if they actually communicate with each other and it was actually a good choice. The MCs were well rounded,",

It does feel like it is a lot about how we are trapped in this wild existence with no real sense. It also has me laugh at a book when no other book does. There's such a strange mix of humor that goes from farce to existential that just makes it a very fun read. It will stick with you and the ideas are just so profound. Plus it was just a brilliant way to bring a bit of joy into the darkest of times. I love that book so much. I even know the whole book well enough that I could read it with my eyes closed for fun.",

It's supposed to be surrealist lit, if one is to believe the blurbs, but the writing and the dialogue are atrocious and the characters as lifeless and unengaging as their names suggest. That there is no actual surrealism in the book is not unremarkable for a novel marketed as such - surrealism has become a buzzword for a lot of people who think a character taking drugs is a 'fantastic journey' as per The New York Times and have no idea what surrealism is - but it's even odder to read the book that the book that got this kind of reception. In all, I wouldn't say it's an especially good bad book. Just a bad book. And not even the most boring book ever written.]\n        Comment #2: I'm sorry you didn't like it. The dialogue was fine,",

Somehow I never got around to reading Superfudge, but maybe because I was so young when I got to read Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, I adore it and adore the friendship between Brad and Peter. Tales of a Fourth Grade nothing is just so incredibly relatable. Peter is the perfect little brother figure. The fact that we read that book way earlier than any YA books are appropriate to start giving to children, speaks volumes.",

I was not much older than that when I picked up that book and it\u2019s one of my favorites I\u2019ve ever read. I read it over and over when I started drinking (I was 23).

I can't remember if I liked it or not first time round, although one of his characters is quite comical, but I was hooked by the sequel, The Restaurant at the End of the World, a few years after and found them really funny.",

If he comes off as smug or even worse, a misogynist douchebag, it makes it easier for you to dislike him initially. The more you get into his character and see the changes he undergoes after meeting Miss Elizabeth Bennet, the more he will win you over, at least in part. By the end of the book he's absolutely smitten by her, which is pretty amusing. He's a character that comes to a realization over the course of the book. He starts off basically being a dick but as he goes along he realizes he's being a dick. It's a sort of humility that I can't stand in real life, but it works out in the novel.",
