    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

My main critique of self help books from the perspective of a reader is: Why should I have to slog through a 300 page book in order to figure out what you have to say? If it only takes you 2 minutes to describe your advice, why not cut to the chase and just say it?",

Hitchhikers had a huge appeal when I was younger as, despite that, I could totally read the ridiculousness of it. But in rereading it I realized I've never actually read a sci-fi novel that treats the subject in all seriousness. Which, I'm sure, is fine for certain audiences. But for me, it just felt like it was trying to be something it wasn't. Like a comedy that pretends to be a serious drama. And I'm finding this problem with many works, as I'm getting older. Even if they're written by authors I adore like Neil Gaimen, Jim Butcher, Tom Robbins, etc. Maybe it means that I've changed as well.. maybe I've grown more jaded.",

I love donating books to friends (I know a lot of people who take books for a reading challenge and want to read a lot of different books) who will actually read them, the library and second hand book stores. In the very bottom of my list is a local donation center for the homeless, who get allot of children's books. A little while back I found the most hilarious story written for small children. I didn't finish it, but I enjoyed the illustrations. They showed a child dressed as Robin Hood, wielding a broomstick as a sword, and a tree as an archery target. Underneath it said, \"The boy was going out with a friend to try archery",

Felt like a chore to start with, and it wasn't the book's fault, but I was working on some of my worst cases of phonophobia at that time and found that reading the wrong thing while I was deep in cleaning would send me into a panic attack. It did for the first part of the book, but with practice (plus some relaxation techniques I'd picked up from therapy) I was eventually able to relax more while doing other things. With a full year passing since I've last experienced those symptoms, I'd say I'm probably a good candidate to finally be able to say I read the entire book without a panic attack. Now, on to my next book.",

I don\u2019t remember, but I do know that the author had much success in his younger years as a writer for the English theater.

It's a classic in the same way that catcher in the rye is a classic. There's not anything to love or hate except for the writing which is fantastic. And I could re-read each and every one of them as a palate cleanser. There's a bit of nothing in them that can be refreshing after reading a bunch of dense or complicated books. I also loved the crossing I've read. It's a slow build up with a very satisfying payoff, and then the sequel had its own slow build up too. Same",
