    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

The narrator absolutely hated the story, and even her reading of it sounded like it was a chore. I found it very difficult to enjoy, especially compared to the other books in the series that she has narrated. While she was very much the right person to narrate that one, I think she was not as great as the other readers in the series were. I had to double check it was her on the audiobook version of The Duchess and the Duckling, because her delivery felt entirely different. That book is one I could, and still do, listen to on repeat and enjoy. (It's been years since I listened to it for the first time, but I still have such fond memories of it!) At least to some degree, I think",

I don\u2019t get this weird rule for adaptations. Most of the time it\u2019s so underwhelming. The movie should have been 9+ hours instead of 9 minutes. So much to do and say",

My sister gave it to me as a Christmas present (she gave me a ton of books) one year when both of us were on Christmas holidays, but a few days into my vacation I returned to college to read it since she had lent me books during the break and I was short of things to read. I remember she gave me a copy when she was in the hospital & I kept it to read later. Maybe. I have a friend/neighbor with a 1976 first edition paperback of A Catcher in the Rye. He bought a bookstore in Portland & the former owner gave him as a going away present. Both books signed by the authors. We both think they would be cool keepsakes. But I\u2019d not sell them for any money.",
