    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

Not sure if that's what you meant or what. \\xa0That's kind of the whole point of fiction. It's fictitious. You probably aren't getting angry at history books because it's fictitious and doesn't apply to you directly. If you're angry that the authors aren't revealing their \"true\" selves than I hope you stop and think carefully about why that is. \\xa0I think nonfiction should be more honest. I know fiction can be as honest as any nonfiction work. But in my opinion and in my experience fiction often allows me to be more honest and vulnerable than the majority of nonfiction I read.",

She was not able to do much but she enjoyed listening to the stories. She actually bought a copy for herself. It kept me going and kept her amused for hours on end. She finished her chemotherapy and survived another few years. She got cancer from the chemo. While that sounds a little morbid, it was a happy time.",

I got it when I was around 23 or so and finally understood what HHG was about and it was the most fun I had in a long time. But then I re-read it the year I turned 30 and it was still so funny to me. I remember laughing so hard in the beginning I had to take breaks and then read in bed later in the evening when it was too late to read it and I would wake everyone up.

The only time I ever watched 'The Vicar of Dibley' was when I was on vacation in England. We were at our rental home, watching cable TV and I somehow stumbled on 'P.S. I Love You'. I watched it with a small tear. I had been there for four days, I was still trying to get the hang of the accent, it was really raining and a bit muggy, and the food I was eating was delicious! What could be better than that? I came across 'All Things Bright and Beautiful' and decided that this looked like something I would like, but would have to watch with subtitles. I was absolutely floored by the way the words fit in my head with the dialogue. I could hear each character's voice, which was amazing, as my accent is a real gift to",

After some time, they managed to catch something in the order of about 100 mice, at that point a big storm hits and sinks the island, leaving the men stranded on a raft in the ocean, with the only food being a few stale biscuits, which didn't get finished by the mice on time. As the days go by, they get weaker and weaker until only one of them is left, and he managed to catch 139 mice, but at that point they were eaten by sharks, and so",

They have very different tones/messaging because they were originally written for different audiences (both during a time in America that was changing very rapidly, so I think it\u2019s even more relevant now) and I like being able to go back to both for a refresher on how to keep perspective in my life.",
