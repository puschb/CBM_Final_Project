    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

I picked it up as an audiobook and really enjoyed it. I'm only now 30% through, about to start chapter 16, but it's a story I'm taking my time with and listening again at some point. The male MC and his story is quite interesting and I found myself very drawn to his character. I did not expect that and am enjoying the rest of the story as well. I'm not a heavy romance reader either, but there's just something about the story telling that's capturing me even through the romance. I had a little trouble keeping some of the relationships straight between the main character and the other characters at the start, but that was my first few days and I'm a forgetful reader. I haven't been on reddit long",

The writing is overly self-conscious, the characters (including the reader) act really weird or out-of-character every now and then, the humor only works because the author has you convinced that the universe is weird and you just have to accept weird humor as a result, it does not hold up to rereading, and finally the plots, as a rule, are just not very good. A ton of world building doesn't actually make for a good world, it just is nice to see, and I would love to see a non-Hitchhikers world in the background of a good book (as the setting for a good book). I've seen people say things about how great a writer he is; I don't share that assessment. I think it's more about that he's kind of a cult, just",

They banned me because I would talk about bad books I had read, and they said that it wasn't constructive. One of the other mods, from a very small mod team, saw what GR was doing, asked if I had tried to appeal it, and said \"the GR mods can't be bothered\". I was furiously angry.... I never went back. This really, really shows how bad GR is becoming a commercial operation. It's now very clearly a marketing platform for self published books and authors. I'm hoping my wife buys me the lifetime subscription before they put the price up again, and then turn it into an ad company... I",

It is a perfect bit of bio-punk, set in the future when Thailand has been largely devastated, and much of its territory (for a price) is owned by a variety of multinational corporations. It's a murder mystery, but only part of the book. Also the story is intertwined with a tale of post-collapse society and government. I'm enjoying the book a lot, and I can't wait to see what other worlds Bacigalupi takes me too. I recently read \"Oryx and Crake\" by Margaret Atwood, which is set in the post-Climate Change apocalypse future, so they'd definitely appeal to each other, and I might pick up another book by him.",

I was hoping for something a bit more suspenseful. Instead, I'm reading about a future where 302 years have elapsed from 2054 to 2356 due to events that occur. It's actually an interesting study at the history of the humanity through the lens of a small group at the bottom of society in 2054. I'd highly recommend it, it's actually very interesting though not much in the way of suspense. But the science fiction concepts are very interesting.",

Great writing, characters you love and hate, and such wonderful storytelling. Somehow he is able to convey the exact same sense of awe and excitement that a little kid has at the world. I was so disappointed when I finally learned that it was an auto-biography when I was in middle school. I wanted it to be a story made up by someone who remembered it, but it wasn\u2019t.

Thus I saw that the spirit of my long lost comrade had long ago left him but the body remained to him, like a worn-out coat which a man takes off and throws away, but which the wind picks up and drives about the air, long after it is free from the body.

And at the time he was one of the few writers I could read. Somehow I had fallen into the library version of the Catcher in the Rye pattern. Like with Catcher, I never identified with that narrator, but the story of him (Catcher) & a few others was all I could get because every other book was (to me at the time) a pile of boring words.

And then when it's all done you finish with just the word \"Amen\" And with Melville you're going to get Melville (which is a lot of writing - the man loved the word \"uncleavable\" - which he used almost every time he made the point). You can skip that part and finish, but the book still won't be \"over.\" His other novels are equally as long. -J-",
