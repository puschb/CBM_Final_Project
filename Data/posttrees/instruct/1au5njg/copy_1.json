I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

But then later, she found out that she was sexually violated since she was 7/8. It felt like a big \"hmmm yes\" because I think we all know that some form of sexual abuse happens pretty often during our childhood but we just pass those traumatized children as soon as they start to be \"able to help themselves\" (if that makes any sense) or when we think that the children would've just forgotten it. As I mentioned, I too had a similar experience around the same age, so I'm really glad she did the whole \"you need help, let's talk about it\" thing with her kids as well.",

And they're so similar in style already it's hard to imagine how you'd improve upon it. As far as sci-fi, I'd bet money you really need to read it again and be in a different environment. The way I read it the 2nd time it felt more like a 2 part novel...I still wasn't overly impressed with the initial part of the first book, but I really liked the rest of the book and all the other ones.

Surely they can't be expected to think things through or have good values or something, because art and writing are so much easier than literally everything else I can think of; I wouldn't mind so much if they were just bad at philosophy, or if the philosophy was just really dumb. It's like they think it's some kind of superpower. I know for sure I like them less as people, but I also hope for the world that they are some kind of exception whose talent for writing makes a bad philosophy brain less relevant than it is in most people, where you should be on guard for your own safety when dealing with them. Because I want to believe that writing good and writing well are not related traits at all, they just happen to find themselves co-existing in a certain percentage of people, and those people can write about anything and the best thing",

I have found myself constantly repeating little facts to my husband, and I now know so much more about our little world than I did when I was younger. And I will continue to repeat that story about the dinosaurs because it is so fun: It's true! It was during the Cretacious period that the first dinosaurs evolved from one small, scrawny bug. In fact, even at the end of the Triassic period, most dinosaurs were still little bugger things. It was not",

I reread it recently, and it helped to make it a bit more palatable, but it still isn\u2019t a story that I enjoy. Just so sad, and I prefer my tragedy to be more fictional and removed from reality. I also love Wuthering Heights, but in my opinion the best and worst parts are its love story. Heathcliff is \ud83e\udd2e but the romance is so powerful and beautiful (well until the very end \ud83d\udc40) but still. Such a sad book, and it\u2019s more real. I love it and I hate it. I read it once before and cried for weeks bc of the ending, and thought it so unfair (still do think it\u2019s unfair)",

I think in high school I used to think I would marry a funny girl because I thought that would make us a perfect match. I don't want to generalize but girls tend be more self-conscious and emotional than males. I always wanted a mate like Allie Brosh: smart, funny, self-assured and caring. I'm sorry to generalize but I would say in general women have a better appreciation of the subtleties of comedy. Because they can relate both as comedy writers and audience members. I have tried making people laugh with comedy routines where I pretend to be my gay self while pretending to be a fat girl, with a funny name like \"Fartzler\". It's funny when I perform it in front",

I was not expecting it to have a dark undertone about the stupidity of the government shutting down the Space Program. I was not expecting the ending to be bittersweet.

We would write our book selections in our Day Planners, including the book store name and date we got it. Many people got bookstore jobs that way because the employees started recognizing us as regulars. One of the books a friend of mine chose was *Heavys* by Jeffrey McDaniel. I have never seen his work in the library, but a student\u2019s great aunt died and gave them hundreds of books with the instruction to donate them to a school or library. They were stacked everywhere. Mrs. N got us to read the covers off those books before we could read ones with bookstore stickers. I saw the title of your book from 25 miles away and chose it. That is the book I have read 7-",
