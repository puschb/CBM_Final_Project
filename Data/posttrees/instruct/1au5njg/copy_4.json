    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

Douglas Adams went to my school when I was a little kid, and after reading how hilarious HGTGTG is, I was in awe of how great of a person must have been. The next day my parents went to his lecture and he mentioned \"Infinite monkey theorem\" and signed a book with a sticker made from 100 monkeys. My parents bought a copy of HGTATG and we went home, I immediately started reading it, and laughed and laughed and laughed, and kept laughing and laughing and laughing. I was hooked.]\n        Comment #2: Vonnegut is not as funny as his fans like to claim.\n        Comment #3: Just read Catch 22. I know Heller is funny and all but it'",

Yes, Slaughterhouse Five is funny, but it is also about atomic bombings and it does not fit in any meaningful context. And what are you even suggesting here? I am looking for books that make me laugh for no other reason than they do. That is what a funny book does. You listed six that you've already name checked in this thread, which is a lot of name dropping in such a short space. So maybe take your own dose of your own medicine here, as you suggested.",

He never shakes that style for the entire novel, and I think he's mostly successful at keeping the series pretty accessible to Wodehouse fans. \"I say, is that a gun?\" \"No, I'm just trying to work out a plot for the next HHG novel.\" \"Isn't life a bitch?\" \"I agree, but that doesn't matter.\"",

Its interesting also when you look at some other authors of the time like E M Forster or a Kipling and you see how Miss Agatha Bertram doesn't fit into the mould they set out for Indians or English men or women in India. I'd highly recommend a read for a bit of satire and social commentary. I'm also a fan of his other work set around the same time.",

It\u2019s very hard to sympathize with Ignatius but what I took away from it was how pathetic and awful we all can be to our fellow humans (or in this particular example, Ignatius was also a petty and awful asshole to the world around him) but deep down so many of us are just trying to find something, anything to give our lives purpose. It sounds like you really did not like this book and that\u2019s okay, not everyone will like it but there\u2019s a reason why A Confederacy of Dunces was made into a movie. It\u2019s a classic book.",

The north side had a sheer drop of maybe seven hundred feet, but the south side had a gradual slope that fell away from the road for five hundred yards and then rose again. It was at the edge of this slope that we landed, on a broad plane that was nearly level, except where a slight rise in the center had caused an unevenness in the ground that showed most easily in the dust which clung to it. Even during the brief time we rested, this unevenness was visible as a gray patch in the dust. It was so slight that few would have seen it, and it was so insignificant that it would hardly have held the weight of an airplane if all the dust would not have fallen there. But the effect it had upon the landing gear was such that all of us fell forward and smashed face front into the sand.",

I don't think there was a part of it that felt \"useless\". What I did appreciate most about it was the way the author's writing was focused on what war was, something that was not really tackled much at that time I felt (which honestly was more recent than I realized). I have heard a lot of comments about how he could have done it more succinctly, but I feel like the length of it really does give you a sense of what it means to be stuck in hell and never being able to reach the light of truth. The style of writing is very much its own, which I really enjoy. I don't think there is a more perfect fit for the book it is about.",

I'm not dumb, but I was just a baby when I got that book and I did some stupid kid stuff but I had never read a book before. the only books I had seen were those kid bibles and it's not like I had the same amount of words I've read now before that book, and so I was just not used to that kind of storytelling at all",

Luckily, director Paul Verhoeven hated the book, which he told Empire he stopped reading after two chapters because it was \u201cvery boring,\u201d \u201cquite bad\u201d and \u201cvery right-wing.\u201d Verhoeven, the director of RoboCop who clearly knew a thing or two about gritty sci-fi satire, realized he could use the book to undermine itself. He and writer Ed Neumeier turned what were originally earnest endorsements of militarism and valor into something uncanny and over-the-top. \u201cAll the way through I wanted the audience to be asking, 'Are these people crazy?\u201d Verhoeven said.*",
