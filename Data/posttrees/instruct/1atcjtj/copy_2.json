    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

An excellent book set in Bavaria in 17th Century. I read it on audiobook. The ending was so emotional, even though I knew it would be. I cried for almost 10 minutes in my car on the side of the road, unable to move without blowing my nose. Thank you, Potzsch, for such strong emotion. Sooooo good!",

He had not known that the story was disturbing to me, and so he suggested that maybe reading to my classmates might be a triggering event for me. After that, I didn't read aloud in school for fear that someone would choose to read me a story that would trigger me. This has lasted all my years of schooling, until now at 42.

Then I said yep and then told my friends that \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. I'm not morose. I don't think about death all the time, but I'm not afraid of it because I've been taught by my parents overtly and indirectly that death is a natural, unavoidable and inevitable part of life. Grieving is a part of living. Death happens, and it's ok, and everyone will eventually move on. And that is the same in life too, it doesn't mean you'll have nothing to look forward to, in fact it's the opposite. I'm 41 and we don't talk about death that often anymore, but I think I've come out better from my parents teaching",

There was this one scene where the boy and the tiger were at a watering hole and the boy was crying his eyes out and the tiger consoled him. The tiger says \"Don't you know I know a thousand tears? A hundred thousand? They don't make it less sad, but they can't make it more so.\" \n\nI got so choked up that I had to put the book down and walk around for a bit- I was on the verge of tears for at least a few miles.",

In your book club, do they usually ask you what\u2019s the last book you read, and then they\u2019re done? When it comes time for the book club meeting, do they just get the first couple of pages and then put it away? Reading outside of your comfort zone requires more engagement in my experience. You have to pay attention and think. It could also be they don\u2019t want others to know which books they like. I\u2019ve seen some people be really stingy about what they\u2019ll read because they want to appear \u201cliterary.\u201d",

You know, write some short story or poem, draw a picture, or just write like a diary about our day and our feelings and a bunch of boring teacher stuff. But I would always look over my classmates\u2019 journals with the other kids and one of my friends made a point about how his mom would write her own stories and put pictures of her book covers on his pages. He was so proud of his mother that he didn\u2019t think to worry about plagiarism. So the next day, when it was his turn to submit his journal, he wrote a whole series of stolen paragraphs from a novel. I forget what book they were in fact from, but they were very specific details and the plot of the novel meant something to someone, I just don\u2019t know who. And even though my friend felt so proud to have an original work of fiction in his journal,",

It always seemed so unjust and I couldn't understand why that happened more often than not. But when Leslie and Jess were killed in that accident I had a full on breakdown. I was probably 10 years old at that time, so I had my mother come into my bedroom and she held me while I cried...and cried...and cried. I could not be consoled. It wasn't just that the death of the characters was sad, but that the death of my friends was as well.",

Then the little girl\u2019s arm was bitten by a rattlesnake and she bled out on the campsite. The little boy was left alone, crying and panicking, when he realized they were still strapped to their chairs where they had been fishing. This book is written in 2nd person perspective (you are the little boy) but for me it was so heartbreaking that I started crying in a crowded classroom reading it. I didn\u2019t finish it until several days later, but I read it through with lots of breaks in between to compose myself \ud83e\udd14",

All the way through the first film when I saw they'd changed Aslan's death and resurrection to a rest, and only the Pevensies cried that time and it was so disrespectful to Peter Jackson of all people, and when I watched the movie to make sure I wasn't dreaming and it also was completely untrue, I was so annoyed I didn't even watch it",

And Lily talks her out of killing herself. I was about 10 when I read it, and I remember being floored because I realized that Lily\u2019s son had just straight up killed himself. That scene is the moment where I realized that life is not fair and life is hard. It\u2019s rough. Life is 2 steps forward and one back. And sometimes we take all the steps with both feet and the one forward is actually a step backward. I don\u2019t think I could have read Harry Potter at that age until the very end because my mom read it to me when I was 10. So I\u2019m very lucky she thought it appropriate for a 10 year old. Her reading it to me changed my life. It also",

At the end of the book there\u2019s a few pages of real stories. He had all this crazy stuff go down because he was a smuggler/drug trafficker. He really did live in the slums in Bombay. The romance in it is fake but the adventures are spot on. It was the first book I read in over a decade. I didn\u2019t read more than 3 books a year until then.
