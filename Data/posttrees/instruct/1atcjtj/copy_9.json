    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

Our other friend was just finishing her freshman year of college, and she was at our house all day every day. She had brought that book with her, and she showed it to me. I remember being stunned. I asked her why, after having read it just a year earlier, why she was giving it back to me now. She explained that she had read it again and had decided that she NEVER wanted to read it again, and that she wanted me to have it for the first time this time around",

It was therapeutic, as well as absolutely brutal, to read that 13 year old girl, full of life and love, could also be so full of despair. It was a reminder of the fragility of life and the cruelty of the world. It was a reminder that if even Anne, who had such a loving family and a beautiful perspective on the world could be taken by an event like the Holocaust, who was I, with my own issues, to complain about anything. It was the first and last time I truly cried until my brother died 20 years later and even that, I didn\u2019t sob or ball my eyes out. I cried because Anne could",

A few years later I read The Book Thief and cried even more than I cried for TFioST. But TFioST was the first time I cried in an emotional way about a book, whereas I cry a lot when reading The Book Thief, it's just sad all the way through. There is no happy end to either of these books, as there rarely is for books that I read, but most of the books I read aren't about people who are dying, so I don't expect",

You should definitely give them a shot, but brace yourself too, because they're a lot to get through in one go.

So many people I've talked to know this book first and foremost for the scene where Lucy is in the wardrobe and is being tempted by the White Witch, but I remember the first time I ever heard it read to me was in church, when she entered the wardrobe. In the church setting, the White Witch's entrance was as a temptress, a femme fatale. She had the sensuous voice of Elizabeth I, full of sexual innuendo. In a more domestic, nurturing setting, it became a more sinister, predatory entity. So both interpretations are ingrained in my head. In the end, I didn't have much use for White Witches who used their magical powers to keep people like me out of their magic lands and under their",

I\u2019d been holding it out for so long, waiting for it to come out, saving up for it for a few months and had wanted it since I started the series at 14 or 15ish. To have it finally come out at 18 or 19 years was a dream realized. Only to have every character die, and I was devastated. I binged the books again, trying to understand what the hell was going on and what would happen next. They still don\u2019t have that story out, so I\u2019m still left hanging.",

I\u2019ve cried over a lot of fiction, but I get really emotional about books and films set in 19th century Japan (not samurais but just life and society).
