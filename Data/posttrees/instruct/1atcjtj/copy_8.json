    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

Then he says that, \u201cI can remember how his arms were folded into his chest and how the folds on the front of his tiny shirt just looked like I am trying to describe a little boy\u2019s shirt.\u201d And then he mentions if you like you could put the boy and pork inside the Dr. Bronner can - and then you could watch them come out the drain at the bottom as \u201cI like to think\u201d as you\u2019ve read it in Dr. Bronner.",

On the other hand, I've read it at many different stages of my life, and I've always had the same reaction. I don't know if I will change my answer now that I'm an adult, but I think maybe I'll have a different opinion on it if I reread it now compared to the first few times I reread it.",

When I was a kid, I felt like adults knew everything and didn't tell me or my siblings because they thought they knew best. I have no idea if that is why, but I have never been afraid of talking about death with my kid, from an early age he knows he's going to die someday and that grandad passed but it was okay because he's not a bad guy, it was his time to pass.",

I'm reminded of A Walk With Love and Death, in which the main character does the math and figures out that the number of children who die in his town, including a number who die in a tragic accident, is not the kind of thing that you would expect to see in a small town with no industry or natural hazards like being near a river. Just the town having a cemetery where children are buried seems to imply there's something that's killing or harming children in the town, but I digress. The main character finds this really suspicious, so he goes to do the math and he realizes these deaths aren't accidental, they're murders, and of course the killer is trying to get away with it by making it look like accidents. There's several parts in this book where the main character finds dead children. There's also a bunch",

I was in my early twenties when I read the sequel trilogies, and they were my first exposure to the saga, I'm very critical of them because I've read the books before. The prequels are all right, in my opinion. The trilogy is my favorite. I'm aware it has problems, but I have no problem seeing past them. I'm not a fan of how Luke turned, but that isn't the worst thing ever that someone has ever seen. To me it's the biggest flaw because it made the series too tragic. I hated the third movie, for this reason. I'm going to read the book at some point, when I have the money to afford it. The original trilogies aren't that good, but they're memorable. And they're just books, in my case at least, the movies are more memorable",

It made her sound like an ungrateful whiny brat. I don't really understand why this book is so popular, as far as I can tell it follows no character arcs, except how the two protagonists become more cynical, and doesn't have a plot, just one event. Then again, it could be because everyone who said this to me is a teenager, and they are more likely to like it than adults are, and/or I don't like dystopian genres.",

For those wondering what the character arc is like, one hint is that there is a man (with children,) who is an accountant by trade, a man of mathematics, and the epitome of calm in most of his life. But he's also a musician, a man who can't be quiet about his feelings. The other is a man of action, who doesn't care about anything but himself but is still a man of discipline in one sense. One finds out his wife is dying, and he falls in love with his new wife. In the end, he loves her, the wife, deeply and deeply she loves him. But when their emotions don't match, he's willing to let her go. He understands the nature of his attraction and the nature of hers: she loves a man who cares, while",

The best of the \"magic in a different world\" series was the Hundred Acre Woods by AA Milne. It is absolutely perfect, and brilliant. As a writer who read it as a child, I wish I\\'d written it. If I were to teach it to a second grader (6 year olds), I would ask them to illustrate it in such a way that they don\\'t need a map of the Hundred Acre Woods.

In the first 10 pages or so, it already started with a rape (not subtle), but I thought that would be the worst thing that would happen in the book (as it is in other stories), so I continued to read. The thing is, David Gemmell would show rape, in the very first page. And the ending. So brutal, that I had to read the rest of the trilogy because I was so mad.",
