    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

When he would have been 9 years old in the timeframe of the story I remember getting mad as hell and putting my fist through drywall, ripping off the door from the wall as well, and I had to go stay with someone else in town, on a separate farm. \ud83c\udf33 The owner of the ranch I was staying at sent my parents money so I stayed there for two years until I turned 16. So I did get over it. But the ending just about killed me. And the beginning of The Road. Yuguhk! The movie has similar problems I think.",

And my mummy read it too me and told me her story about drowning and I really don't remember the book all that well (was 37y ago) except it was about death and was meant to prepare my very sensitive and easily traumatized and overwhelmed toddler self for when people pass away and we deal with grief in a healthy way. Because, as I say I was a very sensitive child. I had a lot of anxiety and fear and was scared of a lot of things like thunderstorms, the dark, dying, ghosts. And my little soul couldn't cope with all the things that kids of that age should be dealing with. The only thing that I really remember about that book is when the mother went to get the mitten and got stuck, the father got drowned because he went onto the ice to get her, and everyone was sad, and there were a lot of pictures of flowers on",

The only part of the book which I thought was touching was the part about the spider web--even then I thought she should've gone with her dad or something instead of that smelly old spider woman. It's probably a good book for certain kids but the first time when I just wanted to get through it (and it was a long time ago, I was on the bus to a summer camp and the bus driver let us read inside during the bus ride so I read the entire book) it just kind of felt like a slog with one cloying scene after another.",

My parents would occasionally give me my choice from a bookstore, and I had a long wishlist that grew faster than I could get it. I started reading the book cover-to-cover (except the pictures/diagram at the front of the book) several times, and it quickly became an annual tradition. I must have read it 30 times at this point, and it's one of my top 3 favorites, even now. (It's in a tough race for #1 with \"Where the Red Fern Grows & \"A Dog Named Scooby",

It's a collection of many of the stories from various anthologies that he wrote along with \"other essays and unpublished letters.\" Included in this are the full, original Silmarillion chronicles that he wrote but never published. You might also consider the History of Middle-Earth series of editions of Tolkien's unfinished historical work from the 60's and 70's, which contains his Silmarillion work. The History is a fascinating glimpse into the mind of Tolkien and how he first created the world of Middle-Earth, but it's kind of like wading through a river - it's not uninteresting, and you can definitely find yourself moving \"forward,\" but the further you wade the more muddied up you get.

I can't think of another main trope of the series at the moment, I read them so many years ago, but this was basically it for me. I felt like reading these books was so fulfilling and I could see so much progression and character development happening to me personally. I",

I couldn't stop thinking about her. We got better, though I'm unsure whether her end is near. She is still energetic and gets pissy about everyone else being on her. A few years ago, she died during the second to last book of the Harry Potter series. I got the rest of the book online and finished after her passing. It felt like a fitting way to go and she had been my constant companion in good times and bad.",

The best place to start is The Organic Chemistry Lab Manual and the associated book. That's only the beginning for any organic chemistry class. The OCLM is also a great introduction to laboratory techniques. That won't help you much with theory-based classes; that you're doing an introductory organic chemistry course is a good sign you'll have those as well. You're going to have to learn how to take notes. No, not the standardized note-taking most teachers force on you. You're going to need to learn some basic note-taking techniques that work for your specific circumstances. You have classmates. Use them. Swap notes. Form a study group.

I know it\u2019s kind of frowned upon by the snobs but I\u2019ve gotten quite a bit out of the books I\u2019ve read. I like them to be interesting, exciting, and with vivid worldbuilding. I was blown away by my first Sanderson book, the way of kings. His books are written to a mass market audience and I don\u2019t mind that AT ALL. But I find myself wanting more than what he has to offer, and I don\u2019t really come across much that fills that niche. Lately, I really have been enjoying Joe Abercrombie and the first law trilogy did not disappoint. It was so dark and gritty in a way I\u2019ve never really seen in others. That being said, I\u2019",

It\u2019s been a big part of my journey of not being ashamed of what I like, whether that be the fantasy genre or young adult literature. I\u2019m not young anymore, and I don\u2019t really care if people say it\u2019s just for kids. All the better if kids can identify with it.
