    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

The last chapter of this book was one of the saddest passages in a book I had ever read at that age. My 60-something year old sister read the book twice, to her six year old son. He read it with her, and then a few more times on his own. I will never forget his face as he walked away from us after finishing the book - eyes welling up with tears. So, there you go!

You see people write the same thing and I've noticed that it's because their heart is in it so the writing is different and it does a different thing to you. And sometimes when the writing reflects your emotions on paper, it feels like the author understands and empathizes with those emotions, especially if they're of a dark nature. Maybe that's what got me with Where The Red Fern Grows, but it is a great book.",

She can\u2019t read yet but I showed her some pictures and read a few pages to her this past weekend and she asked me to read it to her again today. I am happy I can share the love for this book now with her.",

She had miscarried in the middle of a road trip and buried her in a forest, but her father dug up the body and took it on the road trip. In the end, the father reveals to the girl's grandmother (the main character) that he never actually lost his wife and their child because the girl had run back in the forest to reclaim her sister's ashes and was in a car accident, hence the miscarriage. The grandma had also made the mistake of believing he had lost his wife due to one of her old friends from back when they were in school seeing him and misinterpreting it as him being heartbroken over his wife. In the end, all three got out of the car accident and lived. Oh, the pain. !<",

She seems like those kinds of people that you think you know, and only after many years would realize they were superficial and not really a pleasant person overall. I don't think I've ever wanted to finish the book so bad just to have it be over. Same thing happened to me with _The Scarlet Letter_ in grade school. It seemed overly dramatic, it had zero appeal to me, and even though I was only a 7th grader (12 years old) at the time, I just didn\\'t see what the appeal was.

I could see a Redwall map with little red walled castles and abbeys all around it with tiny pictures of every rodent and rabbit and ferret. There are stories set in other parts of the world (one takes place in New York) and while the main character may change, the Redwallers are constant, appearing in the most amazing places.

The librarian was helping me find a kids book, and it looked like she had to help a lot of kids find the books they have requested. Now I think about it she must have had a very demanding time every week. She took my hand and lead me to the picture book aisle, and asked me if I couldn't find a book I would like. I said that I don't really know, but I think a kids book with a kids on it. She said",

And the only way they could do that is if Voldermort came back to kill all the students in year 7. Even before seeing the movie, I noticed that there was not enough time for Harry to be killed by Snape since he was taken by Mal",

As a kid I would have a dog for a few years until they died and they would take the place of my parents as the love of my life, etc. One of the great loves of my life is the dog who is still alive today who was a rescue and had been through terrible abuse and neglect, and the only thing that could change him was to show him love. The dog rescued me. It's been almost 30 years and he's still alive and now a good old man, and me too I guess. So now I'm hyper sensitive to any loss of dogs in movies, TV, or books. I love dog movies, but I always say I don't watch them anymore because I didn't watch them for 30 years of my life already. I can watch any human centered movie these days, but the day I watch \"A Dog's Journey\"",

This comment made me laugh though, my dad wanted to get the \"Adventures of Tiger\" on audiobook for my dog. I was like no way, it's just about an abused German Shepard. But he wanted it for the ending where the dog goes off to live with his brother. The book was horrible and depressing to listen to. We are so conditioned by the way Tiger was spoken to to be so accepting of his abusive state of affairs.",

This was, I think, back in the 3rd grade, it was required reading for us and one of the chapters contained a short illustrated story about a mother nursing her little boy, and he dies of tuberculosis, and his siblings and father sit with them. They had never met their baby brother before he died, and all they had to go by were his tiny clothes. I bawled, then I got angry and it ruined the book for me. I thought it was a trick. Eventually the school counselor made me understand: a baby dying was not something normal, even if it was part of a book. I don't remember feeling sad when kids would die at the end of stories anymore.",

I\u2019d cried at a lot of books over those years, but my grief from my dad took me down in a way that had me really scared. I read 72 books that year and cried my way through every one of them. It was like the tears were never going to stop, but the sadness and anger and grief would only let up briefly. The books helped so much. Crying every single day for years straight while taking care of two little kids and doing life as a single parent meant that my grief and anger were not going to dissipate as they would have if my kids were older. Books filled the hole that I didn\u2019t want to fill. I feel like I could never have done it without them. I\u2019m on a different path with my grief journey now, and maybe once that\u2019",
