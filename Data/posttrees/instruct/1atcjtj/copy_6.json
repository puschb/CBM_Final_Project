    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

I liked it and was able to read the book in a week. The ending just wrecked me. Then I had to send her a postcard when I finished and tell her \"This book made me feel so much, Grandma. It still makes me tear up.\" I am glad she read it. After my grandma passed, I wrote to her that I was reading the book. It turns out she had read it to her adult English reading group. This was after reading the book to her husband's funeral group. This book means a whole lot to me. Thank you again in the afterlife, Grandma Ginger.",

That meant a lot to me, so I read the book. And there was something heartening about the romance, but not as heartening to me is Jane and Rochester\u2019s friendship.

But he accepts her and values her for who she is and he was the only one who saw her value, and she would have grown up with Jane Fairfax instead. The world was so hostile to her - she couldn\u2019t get a job, had no father and no prospects. She had the one loving relationship in the book but there was no romance in the book and that was ok for her, you don\u2019t need a romance to be happy. It made",

The parts I loved were never touched on in the movie so I wonder how that affects people like if they read the book but never watched the movie versus the other way around. I also know now that there is a scene in the beginning of the book where young Andrew Wiggin is playing a game and it goes on for several pages.

So my first thought is The Bell Jar and Fahrenheit 451 but my actual favorite that made me cry was Like Water for Chocolate.

I cannot even count the amount of times my heart was in my throat and I cried. I ended up buying the book and devouring it. It\u2019s been years and I have not forgotten the first chapter. I\u2019ve passed it to several friends but for some reason I hold it and give it to people that I know deserve it. But I don\u2019t even like it.

The main guy got into a car accident with his fiance and had to come to terms with the fact that he was never going to get out of bed again and he had to accept his life for what it was now. I guess that was something I really identified with (though I can walk again, it was a similar type of thing with my chronic illness). Anyway, I don\u2019t usually identify with romance or young adult tropes but was so completely emotionally invested by the end of the book (which I\u2019m not going to name because it was kind of a dark horse).",

That's clear if you start paying attention to her clumsy writing style, repetitive prose, and the constant use of \"beautiful\" which is probably the most overused word in her books. You can absolutely tell how much of an unironic catholic she is, how many catholic holidays she uses as convenient narrative devices (in her more recent works I've started to see her shift away from that though). It's honestly kinda funny.
