    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

I saw the movie, but never read it again. I can get through The Road for some reason. I know I watched the movie, but can only watch a few chapters. Spoiler: I couldn't read the whole thing and I can't even think about a cannibalistic scene. I like movies more than books. I know the movie is good. I have read some wonderful books and watched great movies to end with a good message. Maybe I will try the books again. I have never read the works of JK Row",

I knew the cycle of life and that they were old. I had prepared to say goodbye to them for two weeks leading up to it so I was able to get over it.

This is my favorite quote from him. \"Never read a book because it is \"good for you\" or \"relevant\" or \"in a popular series.\" Nothing will ruin your love of books faster than doing things for the wrong reasons. \u00a0If you like it read it. If you're curious read it. If you think you might like it read it. \u00a0 But never, ever read it because other people think it's supposed to be something. Only you can decide if it's good for you.\" -N.G.A.",

That story really stuck with me, it's the first book that really made me think about what it meant to be a good person, or the meaning of authority. I still think about it today.",

I had a lot of thoughts after that about his character (that would continue to develop in the rest of the series) and how someone could have the kind of empathy he did. When I told my friend\u2019s mom who happened to be a very avid reader about how much I was just emotionally spent by that book she made it clear that if I only cried/heard Ender\u2019s story once then I\u2019d need to read it every few years to a few decades. Her story came to pass lol. It seems like every few years I read Dune or Harry Potter or Brave New World just to experience it again",

She gets an interview, but it's for a job that was an art therapy program for AIDS victims.

I am going to say my sister actually, which makes me sound awful, bc she really can't have kids, but in the book *Kill the Boy Who Crystals in the Blood*... It was a story written from the perspective of her son, so it goes between her own perspective as a mom trying to figure out something is up with her kid, and the kid's diary (written by him as a 12 year old boy), and then he gets kidnapped and sexually assaulted (which I guess is a spoiler?? He doesn't die but he gets kidnapped and it's terrible for him. And his mom is horrified and devastated the whole time as she gets involved in finding him). I cried a lot for my sister, but not for the book. But it did make me sad to think about her struggles, which I suppose",

It all hit me like a tidal wave... my mom even read the epilogue aloud as it hit me because I was too upset to read it myself. It's not that it's a sad story or anything, but rather the culmination of what feels like a real experience, complete with nostalgia, lessons learned, and a whole host of other emotions. I think I've read this book more times than any other other book. It's never going out of print because it means something to every generation that reads",

It's a Samurai flick, except the Samurai are in love with what they think is a damsel in distress, instead it's a little girl that's in the wrong place at the wrong time. She tells him she's destined to become a great adventurer, and sets him out to prove it even though the whole time she's just trying to get home. He's been running from an imperial agent, and his past catches up with him. Then comes the big sad part where she's actually a prince of the destroyed kingdom and his fiancee who was kidnapped, and she uses her last strength to make him promise to find her new home. It's beautiful what comes after that and the whole story is beautiful throughout, I cry every time I watch it.",

The boys are based on real children from that time and the adults in the town basically said \u201cget out of my sight or you\u2019ll be as bad as they are\u201d and the poor boys were stuck in this cycle and made to feel like it was *their* fault they were becoming hoodlums. At least we have been able to see clearly for many decades now that it\u2019s not the fault of the kids, it\u2019s never the fault of the kids. Also, in the original book, one of the boys has a really sick mom. I\u2019m not surprised the kids acted like hoodlums because of how much adults treated them like they were worthless, even their own family. \ud83d\ude26 I think nowadays our society can see these things in this story and know better.

I found myself looking for a self help book that could at least address some of the challenges I was facing and give me a few ideas as to how to cope, but also something fun that could remind me of some of her major triumphs in her life and I picked up Elizabeth Holmes biography and it was such an easy read for such a tragic reality. By page 5 I was in tears and by page 75 I was angry. My major takeaway was that she was very good at manipulating people and creating this idea of a brilliant person that I think most people fell for because everyone just wants to jump at the next big thing to make their millions. It was a great read and very cathartic.",

I wasn't ready for them to have reached their destination only to realize it wasn't safe, and the worst part was that the accident had been unintentional. I didn't feel better until the end, when Kirsten was 37 and got an email from the lake that said the water was fine again, and the family all spent time there together again.

It was a 5th grade book report, but I still remember the scene that took place at the graveyard where Paul Zindel was buried and a group of kids left a note that said something along the lines of, \"Dear Paul Zindel, remember the pigs.\" We were allowed to pick any book we wanted to read for the report, and I chose this one. It was a sad book and I loved it. Also, I remember being in the 11th grade and reading a book about a boy dying from cystic fibrosis called Breaking Faith and that was heartwrenching to say the least.",

I read it over and over. And then once I felt I got the place of everything when my mom told me it was over, I was just like this is it? Its over??? I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was 7. I was devastated. Maybe this was why I have such a hard time finishing books. I know it will come to an end and I\u2019m not ready yet.",
