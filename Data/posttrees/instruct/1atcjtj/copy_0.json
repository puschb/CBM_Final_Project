    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

Watch that, too). In fact, it's set in the same period and takes place in the exact same place, but from a completely different perspective. Beautiful prose. The tale is one of the last trials for capital punishment in Iceland and is grippingly tragic. If you like history, scandals, or just a really beautifully written book, read it.",

I was really looking forward to seeing the resolution of that story because I thought it was interesting to see Oy evolve from this tiny puppy and get a little more human-like by the final book. Then I found out he's from another world that is still trapped there and that I was just a sucker that was drawn in by the emotional story. I'll probably need to read them all over again because of the trap and how much you can actually miss from the story.",

Even in cases where the female characters were fleshed out, they often were written to be attractive in some fashion. The trope of the women having big breasts (it's definitely not always about the breasts) as often is present in those books as the trope of men having long flowing locks. Both of which get described at least once a book,",

So the day we finally finished it we were crying outright for like 20-30 minutes. It was weird. I love this book so much and was so touched by it!",

He was a Social Darwinist from a time when people were just dipping their toes into sociology. He still believed in society (a social thing). He was an evolutionist who held that things were moving on up, from wolves to dogs. It was a time when we were just beginning to understand that all things could become better, from the individual wolf being able to hunt well to the dog, who became a pet and companion to our species. Then there was his love of nature. That's from the Romantic side of the guy, who saw the world in terms of a grand tapestry. It's amazing that we are as evolved as we are because we have lived inside nature's plan since time immemorial, it was very difficult to imagine a better way.",
