    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

First, my grandfather passed away very suddenly and I was going through therapy to get past his passing when I read this. Second, I read it as the last chapter I started reading it around 7AM but lost track of time and read the last 40 or 50 pages on a city bus at 10AM as it pulled into the city. Third, I read the book 3 in total because I could not get the end out of my head. When I finished the book I had to drive a couple hours for a funeral so I literally could not do anything except reflect on the book and the death of my grandfather and the life of Owen Meany for basically 4 hours until I reached my destination.",

He was really evil and was going to be a worthy adversary but then the book ends abruptly (it never really got an ending) after all the setups before the villain was introduced was discarded without any mention or closure at all. The worst parts is that because it never came out and ended its storyline it ruined it a lot of the other books in the series, not just for me but basically every fan after me as well. It set up a very interesting subplot and then threw it out without finishing it. Not a single other book in the series did that. At least they actually had something happen to each of these (death or serious injuries, sometimes both) and they each got some kind of closure. It was a huge mess, and has basically killed my love for the series even after all the other setups were abandoned..._",

I didn\u2019t even know how she would make it though the week let alone another 4 days. If she made it to the radiation I was fine because that means her levels were more stable and we could manage her radiation and chemo in tandem.

I started shaking uncontrollably when my teacher read the last sentence from my parent, but I still cried a little bit during the read-a-thons.

They watch the street from above, in the late afternoon light, and Ponyboy describes the scene for us, until eventually they jump up and out onto the ground, and are amazed by the size of the sun.

That made me really enjoy romcoms as an adult). I eventually returned to it but not right away, and it did change my relationship to sad lit. So it changed the relationship to it for the better.

It was a chore to read again and I felt I understood it more the second time. But, the characters and the story were so amazing that I powered through it. I have so much respect for Emily Bront\u00eb as a writer",

            "comment_text": "I\u2019m 26 and my grandma passed a couple years ago. I was working at a thrift store and she would often give me a bunch of books that she didn\u2019t want anymore. The very last book she ever gave me, I was reading and I was so overcome with emotion of missing her that I cried while on my break from the thrift store. I remember her voice saying \u201care you sure you like it, it\u2019s a little hard to get into at first, but then it\u2019s pretty good.\u201d It ended up being East of Eden, and I was hooked from the very first sentence. It\u2019s hard to explain but there was just something so poignant about being with a book that was owned by a long lost grandma who loved me so much.",

Not to mention the fact this kid was around 30 at the time she was adopted, which is not that young... So she had already experienced quite a bit of childhood at that point. It is pretty well written and a very sad story but not horrific. I know the book is a classic so maybe it's a rite of passage or something.",
