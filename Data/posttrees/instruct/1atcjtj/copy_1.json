    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

I laughed at every part that was supposed to be funny. I did not cry. Nope. I did not cry, which would be the first time I would cry when a fictional character died. The only way I know he died, was because other people were crying. I still haven't cried at a book after 12 more years of reading books.",

One that does get to me is the \"Born a crime\" by Trevor Noah (autobiography). I like the way he writes it. The way he tells the story that can make you smile, laugh or even make you a little emotional. I really enjoyed it. The way he writes it is like he is speaking to you in front of him, although I know he is speaking to millions of people all over the world, I still feel this connection of his words. Great book.",

And if I recall correctly the movie actually made it worse because I was watching it with my dad and it took him a minute to realise I was crying. We got to the part about Jess\u2019s death but the movie didn\u2019t have the whole car incident yet so he was really confused as to why I was crying until he finally realised what he did because of the way he kept telling me to calm down, \u201cIt was an accident, it was an accident\u201d (he and Jess\u2019s dad were actually in the same car accident together).",

I was absolutely horrified, and not just because of the subject matter, that I was reading this in the first person. That it was his diary, and that I could feel how he was \"alright\" about this. I really could. I had to take a few days break to finish the book, and I had a very difficult time sleeping after finishing it. I wanted the female protagonist of the story to have more of an agency so I rewrote that ending in my own words, and the new version made me cry very hard. It is just that I don't have much empathy most of the times, and this book was just too good to let that lack of empathy bother me any longer.",
