My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

In the case of Eragon, they actually managed to get some things that made me angry/upset wrong that the movie didn\u2019t have. (SPOILER) for example, in the book Eragon is 15, he falls in love with Arya, who is like 12, and goes to rescue Katrina. In the movie the plot works the same way except Eragon is 18 and Arya is 14-ish and Katrina somehow falls in love with him and is pregnant? But the movie is about a 15 year old kid who ends up on this adventure with this grown hottie man who gets pregnant. Just like Eragon and Arya\u2026",

People say the movie sucked for it's shoddy writing/filming and characterizations. I thought both did a great job with what they had. I still like the movies for what they are. It's basically the story of a 15 year old trying to save the world. He has some nice bits with his foster brother Garrows. He's not a bad boy. His mother died giving birth to him or as his father was getting an abortion to sell her body for money. The dragons are not done well. The book is just blah. I hate the main characters love interest. The movie takes those elements and tries to make them better. Riddick is in it. He also does not age in the movie. The movie is just bad. I didn'",

Book lovers love to read because they enjoy the story being told in their head while they're reading it, and have their own vision of the characters, the plot, how the characters look, how the world they're in, looks etc. That's why I hate movie/TV show adaptations of my favorite books. They can never live up to the version of the book I have in my head. They'll get things wrong, or the actors themselves will get things wrong, or they'll deviate from the book. And I'll hate it. I'll hate the actors, and I'll hate the show, and I'll end up thinking I didn't like the book as much as I thought I did. Because it ruined my head canon of the book for me. So I prefer it if they, say, don't make movie/tv show adapt",

So you'll excuse me if I've always felt that Frank Herbert wrote Dune for me. And Feyre? She may have the best character development of any female fantasy character in the past 30 years. She's a perfect representation of a naive, sheltered, sexually unawakened girl who becomes a woman through the crucible of hell, and then becomes a super-strong individual who can take care of herself.

His more well known books such as Time Out of Joint, Ubik, The Man in the High Castle, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldrich were all quite distinct and strange but not ones where the protagonists are actively fighting against any bad guys. You might say A Scanner Darkly isn't much of a classic Dick book - I'd argue that the reason is that it is sort of a collection of short stories - but all of them would have their place in a good collection of Dick stories. In that way it's sort of a tribute. There's no reason that his book about a man who is high on drugs and thinks he is a bug can't be adapted as a feature length movie where the protagonist is struggling with addiction and feels like he is slowly dying, rather than a drug reference",

But it does an OK job at the basic premise of invasion, if you like more of the sociological impact of an invasion on people's lives. The book makes it crystal clear that the destruction of the red weed would require that the invaders themselves were wiped out, and that we have the technology to basically do that. But if they are wiped out, we die too, since they are our entire food source. I honestly thought that the book was a pretty good exploration of a pretty serious problem. Is it cool though, that a bunch of martians want to kill us? That is also bad. So this is an interesting moral/ethical problem, about the destruction of what is necessary for our survival at the cost of a bunch of invaders whose death is necessary for their destruction. Ultimately I think",

It does a really good job of giving a lot of information that would go over the heads of younger viewers. It also does a good job of giving the protagonist a strong love interest, and showing that people in power are often morally bankrupt. Also that there is no place like home. My only gripe about the movie was that I couldn\u2019t watch the movie and read the book at the same time. I wanted it to go further in some parts, especially with the main character and his family. And then my opinion devolves into spoilers, so I won\u2019t comment on those points.](>!I guess it does miss a bit of the story in the book when it's cut from that perspective, like we do miss the protagonist's thoughts about how he had once thought he was a naturalist and how far",

Not an especially long time in the span of human history, where an Englishman writing about aliens invading England could be a plausible scenario that people could conceive of. Also the H.G. Wells book, which I think both movies roughly followed, is itself very different to the original Martian invasion story from Wells (though both are clearly science fiction). I believe there are some differences between the stories but the main issue here is that a movie is an audiovisual thing, it can't really convey everything a book does, not just because they're two different mediums but because they have two different audiences. It sounds like you just want a specific story told in another medium, it's",

Especially for the Japanese version, and most especially when you watch the most recent Hollywood film with Johnny Depp. For those who have not read the book, I highly recommend it. It's just one huge plot with many twists. There are 16th novels available to read, and the author is planning to release 1-18. They've been translated into English.",

I actually watched it recently, because I was feeling very down, when I need to take a break from reading. As I said, it's not a bad movie but it was disappointing, especially since Alexandre Dumas is a very good writer. The movie feels like reading a shitty book adaptation and sometimes like the plot is very thin and unfinished. The movie left me with the feeling I've missed a lot. I think my favourite adaptation of it is a Japanese version produced by TBS in 1954, a 7,30 min long series of a few minutes each (40mn total, I think). It seems it's in black and white but since it was done for TV it's very well made, they made everything in a very cinematographic way, there are no \"scenes",

King had the idea for the whole series and he also had no idea what to do with it. He had 7 different story lines he thought were cool enough to bring back for a sequel so he decided to turn it into a single series. Unfortunately what came out was very unfocused.

That's not even trying to be hyperbolic that sounds like a weird thing to say, but I guess it really speaks to how big of an influence the movies were for me as a kid. The first time I ever read the books was after the movies had ended, so I was sort of reading them with the imagining of the movies in my head and I have to say it was a bit jarring to then have the images of the movies fade away and have the book versions of the characters take place. I know that the movies aren't a \"worst version,\" they were good, but I think that's my best example of having read a book and sort of just been let down by a movie or TV adaptation of it.",

This lead to my first experience with a movie adaptation! I knew the series wasn't finished, I knew there was a director for the next movie and I was looking forward to it! They had no plans.

Like, not even just badly adapted... awful all around. I actually remember thinking the author, who wrote the screenplay, needed counseling - she seemed deeply wounded by all the criticism for the book's ending. I think it's an impossible book to adapt to screen, but in a good way. I also think there's a lot to it, and that if someone put actual thought into it, they could pull off an alternate screen adaptation. But that's not what they've done, and the movie just isn't any good.",

It totally undermines so much of the drama and emotion in the story. The only thing worse, for me, was the AMC remake of The Stand (which was bad, but the miniseries from the '90s was not only far superior but is still my most-watched movie). For some reason I keep hitting on the movie and thinking it will have improved, and then get my panties ripped off all over again. The ending is just beyond terrible, for every reason, and if they had only done a straight adaptation of the text, it would have been good enough. I'M SORRY. The ending is the worst ending of anything I've ever had to put up with, across all media.",

I just reread the first. I just finished the second one, and that ending was even worse, IMO. In both books, there is no real emotional connection with any of the characters.

And I'm so so so glad they changed a bunch of stuff that made no sense or was stupid. The plot wasn't well thought out, it should have been a short story or a novella, but a full length novel, eh. It just has too many loose strands that make the writing disjointed and hard to follow at some points and it felt almost as if King just jotted down all the bizarre things that could happen and then went \"haha it will just be so cool to write everything down to see what happens.\" Also it didn't really have a message or theme or anything at all. The movie, while leaving a lot out and not really conveying how fucked up the house and family were, I thought did an amazing job at being a creepy and unsettling film with great visuals",

He had so many more interesting stories to tell than what he wrote in the LOTR series. People didn\u2019t want more, so he just stuck those stories in the appendices. I wish he would have spent more time on that!",

I love the acting in these films, but for me the most disappointing part is they take out the reason the Greaser/Soc's feud actually started. The author is known for his \"realistic violence.\" The feud was sparked by a drunken fight with one drunk who had no issue with Greasers (Cherry Valance, right hand man to Ponyboy's gangsters brother). The drunken fight at the store was the catalyst (spark) between the two groups. They fight all the time, but this one just so happened to be the straw that broke the camel's back. The Greasers won though (in the movie), and were in the minority for that to have led to the whole gang war. I",

I couldn\u2019t see where all the mystical self-help mumbo jumbo was going or what\u2019s to like about a teenage dreamer with no goal who kept moving forward with no real sense of the reason why. The whole thing seemed like a dream-like narrative that was so unrelatable, it failed my test of whether I\u2019d want to be friends with this character and if so, I\u2019d give a shit what happened to him.",
