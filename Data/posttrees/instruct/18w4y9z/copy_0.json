    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

I like space, and the storyline was interesting so I watched the movie as soon as it was out. Then I read the book and was greatly disappointed. For some reason the movie made a great ending out of it, where I was left with a \"what can they do next\" or \"wait and see what they do then...\" The book ended on like a low tone of \"that's it? I wonder what they will do now?\" If I knew how terrible the book would be then I wouldn't have read it. Watching the movie didn't turn me off the book (it was okay), but it didn't sell the book very well either.",

Another favorite adaptation is the 1967 \"Ice Station Zebra\". The book and movie were both great, but the movie added a little something to the ending of the book that I think was well-done.

The Fate of the Furious takes all of that and does what Hollywood does best. Turns a hero into a villain and a villain into an ally.

It was fine, but not something I would want to watch again and it definitely does not make me want to read the book. Also, the BBC one didn't have much of a soundtrack and Colin Firth version had some great pieces that really fit with the film. I'd rather watch a movie version of a book that was written 200+ years ago, than the new adult genre.

I thought the movies were some of the best movies ever made about Lord Of The Rings. I know you didn't like them and that's your opinion. That's fine. I liked them very much, especially The Hobbit. My point is that those who judge The Hobbit movies for being different don't care about art in the slightest. They care about themselves. A lot. They are angry and they like that the directors were angry. But they themselves wouldn't be nearly so much better writers than those directors that they could come up with the money shot of the movie scene. And yet these people are mad at them. Because they know deep down they aren't good movie watchers. And they aren't good movie watchers because they don't really like the movies they watch like those",

The Hobbit is a quick (as in shorter than the running time, and shorter than LOTR) trilogy of fun, easy to consume chapters of adventure that is great for younger readers, younger fans, and anyone who needs to be introduced to middle earth or who want to take a bit more time to get their feet wet in Tolkien\u2019s world. LotR is the slowest build of characters and story that Tolkien has ever done, a lengthy 4-part narrative that is dense enough to spend days on. The Hobbit is like the book version of a Star Wars prequel trilogy. LotR is the book version of LOTR the movies and TV series and books and everything else in the middle earth universe. It has decades, and even centuries worth of characters and story and richness.",

For me, after the first 80 pages or so, it completely turned into a different world which was more interesting than my current life. The concept of a magical world where a bunch of kids, none of whom liked each other, were actually friends - that was what I needed at that time in my life and it felt like the first time I'd read something that was tailored so well for me in a way it felt like the author was speaking directly to me. So I could completely immerse myelf in it, because it felt so easy, but it did have a similarity, the school in the book is almost like a village or small town. And the first book was an interesting and complete work of art in itself but not a whole story. For the second book onwards, the world itself became so much more defined and explored and to me I felt like the books grew and became better",

This time I was really surprised it wasn\u2019t better, the writing was so plain, the concepts fascinating, the characters unrealistic. I was underwhelmed overall but I have a lot of nostalgia for this particular book just because I remember how much fun it was and how much I loved it when I read it in high school. I will admit, though, that the 2022 movie with Paul Dano and Michael Cera made me enjoy the book even more and I would go see it again in a heartbeat if it was playing locally.",

The protagonist, Marion Bellamy, had some interesting qualities: she had a deep love of reading books (libraries are mentioned more than once and she had a large personal library), was interested in languages, was devoted to her dog, but was also depressed and suicidal. My interpretation of the book was that the reader has free choice in whether or not to be complicit in Marion's suicide. She has this wonderful, rich imagination and life that we've shared together through a first person narration, and the reader is aware of that, so it's up to the reader to decide if it's worth it, is it right for them to stop her at that last moment before the act. As a high school senior, I chose to let her go. A few years later, I realized that I should have decided to try to help her. I don't",

But she falls for him and he falls for her just as much. The other 2 books, the other 2 leads are way more interesting. Katniss and Peeta just read childish to us.

Also Book 2 was not really as enjoyable or memorable as book 1 (or 3 for that matter). The movies did just what they needed to do in terms of adapting book 2 and that it. In book 2 the books went too much into the romance and politics and not enough into the adventures.

To adapt the last 10 books that's how I'd do it. Each book has a subplot involving a different character, so you can have a subplot or 2 in a few episodes and then the plot would basically be Vetinari.

But they're both good stories for different reasons IMO, so it's worth watching the movie if you haven't seen it (but, for the love of all that is holy, don't try to read a summary of the book, read the full thing - even if you think you don't have time).",
