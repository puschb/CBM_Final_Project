    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

Like, once you saw it, you knew the plot of the entire trilogy, and all its elements were already familiar to you. So the experience of seeing each movie didn't add as much as it does in a book, where each book added more and more. I mean, I still think the first movie is great, but I don't like The Hobbit movie very much.",

The movie made Charlie a more fleshed out and relatable character. In the books, it took Charlie nearly the entire book to explain *that* he was broken and not only sad. I never got the feeling that the book was ever written in Charlie's point of view though, when it's actually written as omniscient narrator, which is confusing when you're trying to feel involved by a character.

I also enjoyed The Three Stigmata of Palistro, which is what was made into \"Total Recall\". I also read \"A Scanner Darkly\" about three times but I just did not enjoy it. It was interesting but not very entertaining. It isn't written like a thriller and definitely not like an action flick. It's very much a novel, unlike something you see on screen.

Spielberg would not have the budget or a cast to play people that wanted to escape. Everyone knows the 2005 movie has nothing to do with the book, but it is just as hard to understand from the book because it's very difficult to convey what it's trying to say. To this day, people ask me what the movie was supposed to show or where the message was because (to them, anyway) a movie can't have just been a two-hour scene of a guy running for no reason.

I am on page 36 of the book now, and I keep having to put it down. The writing is beautiful with its vivid descriptions, but I keep getting flashbacks to when I worked in a library and the kids who picked it up and read the first page as if it was a graphic novel, then turned it over and walked away from it like they had seen enough to tell if they wanted to read it. It\\'s about a boy who deals with things in the way that 10 year old boys who have parents who are getting divorced and whose mothers are dating alcoholics would deal with it: he lies to them",

The books, in reality, are a series of character development of an interesting world with interesting characters and interesting events. There is no TV series that could adapt the books as books, because they are not the books. They got a TV budget and ran with it, not in the way the books worked into an interconnected series that didn't need a movie but an entire universe to explore, because the books are just a part of what the series would need to tell that story. It would need to be much more than a simple tv series.",

I'm a little disappointed that it's so heavily tied to a political agenda - I didn't see that coming, and while I have no problem with political books (and even political books that are critical of the author's personal political views), this was just a bit too cloying for my liking.

                    "comment_text": "> 1) Possession by AS Byatt. One of the most breathtakingly brilliant novels made into one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is driven in large part by the male protagonist being a hopelessly introverted, very British, painfully reserved failure of a scholar. He has a complex and deeply intellectual inner life. His bumbling, demoralizing failure to land a career is the very thing that launches the story - he takes an unforgivable risk out of pure desperation. The movie turned him into a swaggering cocky superficial American cowboy-type character. And so absolutely nothing in the entire story portrayed on screen makes a lick of sense. Yeah, I had a hard time with it. Not a lot to like in it.",

It's a decent movie as a movie, but it just doesn't feel like a fitting Gatsby adaptation, but it certainly was also better than The Gatsby-era adapations I've seen and have read the book (one of my favorites). I also really don't think it did the book any justice. Notably so in the areas of the narrator, narration focus, symbolism, and style.",

One day the phone rang and it was a film producer inviting him to write the screenplay for the Pride and Prejudice. They met up. My mate pitched his idea - he'd be faithful to the text and bring the romantic couple to life but he'd also try to do something about the social justice issues of the 1810s, not only in the text but throughout. He'd try and do the same but for the 1990s. For 3 hours he made the case for why the script would be a great idea. The producer agreed, told him he'd give him a contract and left.

The show did a nice job of adapting the books, while also making significant changes that actually improved on the books in my opinion. Then they came out with the second show, Percy and the Olympians, and it was awful. All these new characters who are just copies of the other characters with no personality. The same storyline but changed around. Even the actors didn\u2019t fit in their roles. It was honestly bad. It\u2019s so disheartening to see two different adaptions of one book get so different results. I really think that this is such an underrated series that needs more attention because it\u2019s really good.",

Not to be cynical, but I wonder if it was a PR move - I saw this book pushed, pushed, and pushed some more. I read it and I was so underwhelmed, I think I even forgot about it as soon as I finished the book... So it's the kind of book that doesn't resonate with me much, but it has a lot of potential to resonate with a lot of people. My friend also absolutely loved it. I would hate it if I'd had to read it in school, but it is also not the book I'd recommend to every teenagers who wants to start reading more, because they're all different. It's also not the kind of book I'd recommend to kids aged 8-12 because it is not",
