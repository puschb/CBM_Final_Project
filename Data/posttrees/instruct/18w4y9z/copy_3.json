    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

It's an actual dialect spoken in Africa that I had grown up with. But in Eragon and its sequels everyone with that dialect had the name Acaan (saw that for real lol).",

I read it all in less than a month and fell in love. I was the first to get Inheritance and that book broke my heart (in a good way lol). When I first watched the movie trailer, I was so excited. I told all my friends and they even got me an Eragon hoodie for Christmas 2021. As soon as the movie came out I watched it with them, and I left that movie feeling so incredibly let down. It was such a huge missed opportunity for me. I will never get over the disappointment.",

It was not an optimistic experience. However, I only read the novel of the book about six years later on the recommendation of a book club friend of a friend. I will confess that the book had some problems, but I generally found it to be a fun page turner. I do appreciate that it was written *for* teenagers and it has a very \"YA\" style. Still, the movie takes a book that is a YA and reduces it to about 20 minutes which is about equivalent to YA fanfiction you\\'d see on AO3. I do also acknowledge that a big part of my problem with the movie is that I loved the book enough that once it got past about the half-mark, I basically knew the book, and the movie didn\\'",

It's quite funny how everyone claims it's a great movie or that it's the best Dick. It's clearly a lesser work in terms of plot and style compared to the novel and the animation but it's great to see him take the style he's known for elsewhere and apply it to a more serious science fiction genre that he hadn't done much of before.",

The Great Gatsby was also okay, though the focus on class and money over the theme of lost love was really distracting. The movie Moulin Rouge captured a lot of the sensuality that's in the second part of that novel, and the book itself is one of the great romances. I'm also a fan of the adaptation of War and Peace, which was really really good.",

I said no, it wasn't.

The book is great, but I think a lot of the problems are people not understanding the world of the book or what being brainwashed really means.

But if you think about it from that perspective, this isn't a bad little trilogy, the way The Lord Of The Rings is a pretty good trilogy, even if you don't like the ending. It's just a pretty good series with some flaws. >!It's interesting, but probably misguided, that he felt compelled to end it the way he did\u2014with a bunch of cultists sitting around campfires. That's not really a satisfying ending, or even a satisfying story, IMO. Sure, it worked for The Lord Of The R",

If you don\u2019t mind me saying, you\u2019ll probably have a different opinion than me bc what I thought of the ending of the book will most likely not line up with what I thought of the ending of the movie (due to differences between movie & book that are also important to consider) and I get that but it was such a bummer for me when I found out that it was that way (I wasn\u2019t interested enough to go the movie right",

Even though you could tell it was made on a bigger budget it still was more faithful than the 2002 film with Zac Efron. But that\u2019s fine, the 2002 adaptation of Firestarter tried to make it into a full blown action film which it really wasn\u2019t. The original novel was a really good slow burn psychological horror with a dash of action. It just turned completely action and over the top. I just wish the 2002 adaptation was made in the style of Stephen Kings more creepy small-town-horror flicks like The Shining, The Mangler, or Salem\u2019s Lot (the TV movie). It would\u2019ve been a great fit for the film. And they should\u2019ve used Stephen King as the screenwriter. He wrote the script. But at the end of the day, a great Stephen King",

David Lynch, with his Twin Peaks franchise, has long struggled with the divide between the male and female audience. Twin Peaks: The Return showed a shift in that struggle. With its very explicit depictions of violence, Lynch took control of the visual language and gave the audience control over interpretation. It\u2019s a masterful piece. But with Fire Walk with Me, Lynch relies on female trauma on screen. I\u2019ll agree that there are redeeming aspects to Fire Walk with Me. But there\u2019s the other side of that coin where it makes me want to throw that film away and not even look at it again because the suffering it shows and how it is portrayed, and I\u2019m glad to see that it\u2019s at least being discussed here.

Everything felt incredibly bland, except for the dialogue between Edward and Bella. That was probably my least favorite thing about it. It felt like that scene in the film where they talked about their first date and it was all in English/French. The way it was written as though they were having a super awkward conversation in front of an auditorium felt so weird and out of touch from what it should\u2019ve been like based off of how the rest of the books were written.

On the other hand when you really consider that the book was a mass-market blockbuster for a short time in the mid-2000s, and it got a movie that basically had a \"who's who\" of the most bankable stars of the time... and the author got to adapt his own book, and direct in some capacity... so by a certain measure of success it's a great adaptation. I guess if you want a book turned into a great movie without any compromises at all, my suggestion would be to learn Russian and adapt a book by D. M. Thomas directly into Russian for a Russian audience. Or if you want something more realistically doable... I really enjoyed the movies by David Fincher (Fight Club, Gone Girl, The Social Network",

Look around in the library for books in the language you speak (or just go to Amazon) and look at how many other people have reviewed that book, on average. If you see numbers like 1,000+ or 10,000+ - that's a strong movie. If you see numbers like 10 or 100 - that's much more likely to be a dud. So for example, A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson has 960 Amazon reviews so far. It's one of the more popular books among travellers. How popular is the movie? 24 reviews on Amazon. There is also the fact that the movie is set in 2014, which means that the book is going to be at least 11 years old. If it came out in 2",
