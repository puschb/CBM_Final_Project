    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

I read the whole novel and at the end it was completely different from what I thought it was going to be...I was super confused...I was mad at myself...how could this author mislead me in such way!? I think Clements is like 99% of people I know, in that we don't remember the ending of the books we read. Maybe that's the reason they could mislead us.",

We don't see a hero who goes from a normal life to a hero with powers. We do see a hero who was normal but then his life was ruined. And then the character of Eragon never changes. He's always this brooding guy. And the character of Roran is even more boring. The story is just them moving for one reason or another.",

I just don't think it's a book that needs to be reread as an adult, if it feels interesting to you give it a go.",

It was the first in the series so it had a lot of world building and setup to do but it wasn\u2019t over bearing and was the first step in a great story line. There were 4 books I believe in this series, 7 if you count the whole Inheritance Cycle, all of which I recommend. There is even a sequel on the way, with the fifth book being finished this past Dec. 4 books are out now and they have a wonderful set of stories! You can check out the wiki on Eragon (with all series included) at the end of this comment, it has every bit of info you can imagine on the story itself as well as the creator. If you\u2019re going to jump in, book 1 (eragon) will probably be your best bet, unless you prefer the audiobook which is a great way to go as well",

I also think it's not as well written as some other YA books of the time that have the same themes. And I also think it's an absolute masterclass compared to the many teenage authors currently working. My wife says she's worried about eragon getting lost in the shuffle of a lot of other similar books from over the last decade. I'd say they should be a team. There are other great authors. But this one is my favorite.",

I don't see any reason not to do a show that's trying to show a story and make it appealing so I don't fault HBO for making a series that's more popular and has a lot of good aspects. But as literature I still prefer the original books. The original books have a lot of merit as literature and they are both smarter and more fun to read than the HBO series. They are far more fun than something that is trying *hard* to be a TV show for children and adults alike. They have a really interesting premise that's actually kinda subversive of its time about how society has always seen animals as less important than people and the whole society treats the animals like shit and abuses",

I don't mean to slag on the Coens any, as I think they tend to make very interesting and well-done films, but their focus on genre can occasionally lead their storytelling toward the conventional, whereas the novel is anything *but* conventional and is a masterful piece of postmodernist art. I have a theory that McCarthy's writing works so well for screenplays because of these two reasons. He's a master at the kinds of characters, narrative structures, and themes that make good movies, and he writes his books a little like a screenplay, where the author gives us just enough of the story to get the audience going and make the filmmaker's work that much easier. He also understands the medium very well, because his first job out of college was working as a screenwriter here",

The second hand interviews with survivors range from a week old in Africa to twelve months old in Australia and the Americas. The interviews are used to create a more complete picture of the spread of the zombie outbreak and how it will probably all end. The book describes the outbreak of the zombie plague and how it spread from its origin as a lab experiment to the general population. The book goes into detail about how a government in general reacts to a pandemic, shutting down travel, shutting down schools and businesses and locking down cities. The book doesn't have the fast moving spread of the virus as is common in contemporary zombie works, but instead focuses on the human aspects of the outbreak. The book describes how survivors react to a situation where everyone around them is dead and everything around them may have started",

It's an 8 part miniseries that starts with a story about a kid trying to find his parents in wartorn Israel and it's basically 20 years as an animated documentary going backwards through the modern history of the middle East. WWZ really fit seamlessly as the ending arc of that story",

Chiefly, the character development of Lloyd in both the book and the miniseries. In both cases, Lloyd is a pretty big asshole, but in the book, for example, he is inadvertently more racist than anyone else, and it really just highlights how he is actually a bad person, who justifies his bad actions and attitudes toward minorities to be 'just the way things are' and it's not up to him to do the right thing. The miniseries had Tom Cullen as Lloyd, and I thought he portrayed Lloyd as being *aware* that he was a bigot and he needed to watch it. He was much more realistic, for me.",

But there's a line of history that runs between the novel and myself, and I love that. It doesn't hurt that I live in an area with a lot of history.

Then, they killed basically the entire police department and all the witnesses to that massacre, and then the only cop who survived gets cut by a bad guy. So now one good guy has died and two bad guys. Is she suddenly seeing that the good guys might be the bad guys? Heck no, we're just going to ignore everything she's seen and done in the last 30",

Henry and Claire were not the people I imagined so vividly in the books - the actors were not the actors that I had in my head since I started reading it when I was young, but they still did pretty good. As you'd expect I loved the actors and actresses as I am used to see them but it never crossed my mind that they aren't the best suited for this movie (I still feel that way though, but I'm so glad to see them together).",

They had no sense of any continuity or worldbuilding across books. The books are, at their core, a series about a man who is dealing with learning about and using magic to fight against a longstanding empire, which is evil of course. There are a ton of social allegories to the state of affairs in 1958 China. It is a dense world full of mythos, and that\u2019s not even counting the 100+ years he spends in exile. That\u2019s a lot of time to develop character and world, and the film couldn\u2019t even cover 3 books!",

But all on a different sense. Some have their thoughts about cats or the rain or beans or grass or horses or pebbles - but I am like that about love. It is all around me. Always.' \" I read Daphne du Maurier's novels as a young teen, and fell in love with her beautiful, haunting style. I've lost count of how many times I've shared that quote with others.",

I'm sorry but that's crazy. Do you think any authors would have written something like this? If they were all writing the same thing, then why is it called literature? This was around my mid-teens, and I thought it was an obvious thing, but for a lot of people, it isn't.",

We would sit on the living room couch before bed and I'd read what I was reading so high that I'd pass out. This lasted many years. In my 30's, I read the Left Behind series. I don't remember much about them other than they are awful. They are like the Bible in book form. The movie is like watching the Bible in book form. I cried because I realized these movies actually got released in the theaters and ruined a good thing for me. I don't read for the story so much, I read, get the gist of the story, then get something out of the book. This movie ruined me. Just the most awful feeling of disappointment. I don't trust anything that comes after the movie. There is no way anything can top it, so I just won't even bother. And I'",
