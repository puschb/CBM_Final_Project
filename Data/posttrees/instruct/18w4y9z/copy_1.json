    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

As for movie adaptations, can we have them just make what they call an adaptation. There was a great movie called the Secret World of Arrietty, but they wanted to add the Borrowers name and get a famous person in and it became The Secret World of Arrietty and The Borrowers movies so I never got to see them. The original is a classic I rewatch once a year and it's based on Mary Norton's book The Borrowers which is a classic I re-read every winter. And both are on streaming. The movie is just fine on it's own and I only watch at least one of them once a Winter. So I don't need to see it. If an adaptation has to be that it must have a new name? But why? And then they say 2023 will be",

Just a glaring continuity issue that could have easily been fixed. I have to say I love the film though, it's much better than most YA fantasy adaptations.",

The problem is that, while I've seen and enjoyed Blade Runner, it's not quite the same thing as adapting Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and you're not going to put Philip K Dick characters into a movie without making it feel like a Philip K Dick book or making it very, very different. Dick was very much into the idea of making human characters think they were robots. Not to just say \"look at how like real humans these robots are\" or \"let's make the robots really cool\"",

And yes, I'm not an American English speaker, so I may not get some expressions, but I'm an English speaker with a degree, and it's not that big of a language. I understand the phrase \"the Bat-Signal\" perfectly. And there's 7000 words to talk about, including a couple of different Bat-Signal related scenes. And even though the Bat-Signal is used at both the beginning and the end of the book, the guy uses the Bat-Signal in two different chapters",

They probably feel compelled to put HG Wells at the opening on the screen because the original was based on Wells' book. That's kind of like the movie Jurassic Park. The original JP book was based on the book \"Life on the Third Planet,\" by Michael Crichton. I really liked the JP film, but it does bear almost no resemblance to Crichton's book and I wouldn't have liked the film version of it as much. In other words, the makers of the JP film just took his core idea and ran with it in completely different directions. It's been done that way so often because studios like films that are going to make money, not films that are going to stay faithful to the source",

A lot of people complain about the length and pace of the movies but I think they did a wonderful job adapting these very dense and sprawling source material into a coherent film trilogy! There's not a ton I wish they would have done differently. But I agree that LotR and the Hobbit are apples and oranges when it comes to adapting book to film; LotR is a beautiful work but also requires a lot more to make it work, but it's still a coherent work with a linear structure. The Hobbit is a different issue: it's very episodic and almost a collection of short stories, and the pacing is more relaxed/slower as I'm sure you would expect from the title. Even the books themselves say it's essentially just \"a pre-adventure\" for Bilbo. I'",

Don't get me wrong, it's a fun read, but not in a way how the movie was a fun watch. It's sorta of just... too shallow? The themes it wants to represent, I guess. And in addition to that too many plot elements felt kind of disjointed? The book was a fun read none the less, I wouldn't trade it for anything, but it felt almost like a YA novel in the sense of how over the top the writing style felt to me.",

Even the citywatch subplot was decent fun. \u00a0It was just that that subplot turned out to be the crux of the final two novels in the sequence, so you can kind of understand why people were unhappy. But that's a series with a lot of thematic overlap across the 45 books as it is, so I can also understand why they went that route given that they would have needed to shoehorn something in.

One issue though is that the story is extremely self-referential, it's riddled with quotes from Shakespeare and other 18th Century authors. One of the main characters is a sort of god who loves quoting Shakespeare as a way of getting the plot to move forwards, often through anachronistic use of Shakespeare as a way to advance the plot. The narrative also has a lot of other elements drawn from the Discworld books, for example the main character of The Watch being a parody of the character in Terry Pratchett's novels which makes a lot of sense. The series is very self aware and the self-referential nature means that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to do a screen version of Discworld without the source material and the cast being",

But like 5 minutes into season 2 I was so pissed off at the characters being completely unfaithful to the book, or to each other for selfish reasons, that I stopped in the middle of the season. Also, I really don't understand why they decided to make half the dialogue into voiceover...\n        <<ANSWER>>\n        \u000b\n        \nThis is such a good example.

It's become a swampy wasteland and there are these giant mollusks that live on land and eat people. The main character is a famous author and he's traveling with his agent and bodyguard. They meet some other people who are trying to adapt the environment so it becomes more livable. They have found a way to grow plants in the water! There's a subplot where the author wants to write a book about mollusk sex. It's very strange. The movie (2049) is called The Drowned World and is on Amazon Prime. If you've never seen it, it's worth checking out.",

As I was reading the book, I was like \"Why are they giving advice based on what people say?\" It's like saying a male could give relationship advice based on what women say. The main premise of the book is that men use cliches because they don't want to hurt women's feelings. Men don't like conflict, and sometimes women make a man uncomfortable in some way or another, so men sometimes say nice things just to reassure a woman. The book literally says that men tend to be simple creatures, and that the best way to know what a man wants is to listen for them to say what they want. So, why is this a self-help book exclusively targeted towards women? As soon as I heard this book was popular, I knew it was going to have some terrible information,",
