    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

But it does feel like over time it\u2019s gotten worse. There\u2019s some really bad character moments in it, where the dialogue just seems off from what a character would naturally say or the reaction would be a bit strange. It\u2019s still a fun story if you enjoy elves, dragons and magic. But it is definitely not a well respected series at this point.",

This is something I've noticed about film fans, they seem to completely miss what films are trying to achieve. It is a completely different medium, with entirely separate constraints and an entirely different medium. One of the biggest issues I notice is film fans being disappointed with a show because it didn't 'stay true' to a book. It didn't 'stick to the source material' as if it is a literal translation instead of an interpretation. There's no other medium with the constraints faced by film (short time, short amount of words, need to convey character arcs, motivation, etc), you have to make artistic choices and compromises in order to adapt a book into a film. It's never going to be exactly like the book you liked. It is the nature of",

If I'm reading a book and I stop to think that I'm reading The Hobbit, I do it because I enjoy the book. I'm not an elitist snob. However, it still feels weird to me. Just the other day I was talking to someone about the best books I've read lately, and I mentioned House of the Spirits, and I also mentioned I'm reading The Hobbit. The person I was talking to was like that's not really a book. It's like reading a children's book and it just felt so dismissive. Like it was completely unnecessary yet still had the audacity to be said",

So it's still on my shelf, un-read, waiting for her to make a decision on her reading preferences. And for the record, the movie was perfectly fine (and if anything, I would give it a slightly higher quality rating than the book itself, given the first half of the movie *isn't* written by Tolkien.).",

I don't know what happened, but I'm not blaming Peter Jackson for that. I'm pretty sure that what went wrong is that the suits at New Line Cinema decided to pull the plug on the second Hobbit movie and demanded that the final film finish the entire story, but Jackson had already filmed most of the second film, and it just wasn't long enough. So they had to pad it up with a bunch of useless stuff, resulting in two films that should have been one, and a final film that should never have been made.

Anyway. In the book, we understand that the evil bank is not being honest to the children. But honestly, it's a bit weird that Mr. Poe and the Baudelaire's accept their explanation. Especially because of how the movie was written that it's clear that the bank should have told the truth. It was also a bookish mistake of not researching it. The movie was made in 2004 and I read it in 2018. So it took the movie makers 14 years to catch up. I know it is better they waited, but it would be better if they put some work",

The book is good but it\u2019s hard to think of that book as actually good after it became such a clich\u00e9 in like 2019 and 2020. Plus its the only big thing he has written and after I read it I was excited to get into Less Than Zero and The Rules of Attraction but found them to be super boring.

Hoover, who was the first director of the FBI but who is most well-known today for his 30+ year tenure as the director, is depicted as much more central to law enforcement even during that period than he actually was. So you'd think the movie would really play that up and make Hoover, who's widely seen as an important figure in the story of the FBI, even more important in the story. Instead they decided to give Hoover a much smaller role and instead have the main characters be the G-men. They also changed the narrative structure quite a bit.

I liked the book and saw it being adapted into a movie as almost a blessing for someone who has a terrible social life and finds it super hard to find like-minded people.

Also, the way they portrayed the parents just didn't sit right with me. The whole thing when Charlie gets stoned and goes off with Patrick was different from the movie and it made me feel really uneasy. I also think we are supposed to love the movie as much as the book, but the characterization of the characters felt more... \"surface level\" than the book and I don't think it really touched on the depth of the characters as the book did.",

If nothing else, please read the synposis, it's pretty fascinating: \"The Babel of the title is situated on an island off the coast of Siam in the late 19th century.
