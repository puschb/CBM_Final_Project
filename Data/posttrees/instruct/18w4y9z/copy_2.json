    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

I didn't dislike the book but I didn't care for it aswell. The movie was a trainwreck however which made me forget the book in the first place. I have seen it around 50 times and my first memory is about 8 or so years old so I was born after the movie and I read the book maybe 1 year ago. Even if you hated the movie, I wouldn't care to jump back in to it.",

The show was actually one of the things that convinced me to read the series again, and I must admit that watching Riordan's works on screen first was really helpful - I'd never been able to properly visualise the settings in the books because they were so vague, but when you see a full-blown world on-screen... It's incredible to watch. And obviously, it's much more entertaining than reading (or audiobooking) the books alone. So yes the show is great, the series is one of my absolute favourites.",

I think he wrote the first 2 stories decades apart and it was only when he got into the writing rut that he started reading old and abandoned scripts and figured out which one he was going to follow going forward. But the scripts weren't bad, they were just different. I would really like for there to be another book or two, a series of short stories. I want to know more about Roland's past with the gunslingers. (Not the whole set, just the ones they had to meet the man in black) I want to know what happened to the others who took the call to Gilead.. I want to know more about Oy.",

I just finished reading the very first chapter and I'm just getting to the point in which I can really start to see how he investigates these types of crimes. It's not even all that much - it's like the very first chapter. Then the next chapter is some back-story. But it really sets it up so good, I can't wait to read the next chapter. The way he is setting up the narrative to make it an extremely gripping read is just beautiful. I can't fucking wait until I get to the murder in the middle of the book when the 20-year old mass murderer, by that point, is revealed to literally just be a psychotic child with mental illness when he was 6 (and this all takes place in the 1950s).",

When he wrote the movie script, it was called The Overlook and was about two dads taking their offspring on a winter holiday and being murdered by the haunted hotel, to the point where the hotel was more of an antagonist than the psychotic ax-wielding maniac.

I haven\u2019t read book 1 yet but plan to read it asap and then dive into book 2. I\u2019m currently reading my 2nd (out of 9) book by this author. I\u2019ve been meaning to read her first series, which is what book 2 is. Now I\u2019m not sure whether to read her second series next or to read the first series first. So should I just finish her latest book, then start the first series, then move to her second series? Or read her first book next, then her first series, THEN move onto her second series?

I\u2019ve seen the other films and they all felt like different books. With Emma, she was too much like Harriet Smith; the Austen version has more nuance. Emma Woodhouse is much more calculating and condescending (a side I hate), and I know she\u2019s young, but her friends weren\u2019t drawn out well, or the actors were poor,",

Instead, the movie just has all of these characters shouting and screaming at each other, some of them unclear about the difference between the two theories, which makes for a poor teaching instrument. The whole point of it is to learn and be entertained on the journey, but the movie was neither teaching me anything or funny or interesting me in any way.

It's pretty much the same story, yes, but the cinematography of the movie has nothing to say with the writing in the books. I had a very different movie in my head while reading the novel. And that was the movie where I liked the story, the characters, the chemistry between the characters. That is the movie I wanted to read when I first picked up the book.",
