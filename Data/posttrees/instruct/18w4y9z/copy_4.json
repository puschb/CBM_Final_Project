    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

But if the reader has read The Hobbit, then it's a desecration of a great book by Jackson. Jackson's Hobbit movies are nothing more than 20 hours of prefabricated dazzle and special effects designed to squeeze cash out of teenagers. For a book that was never meant for young readers and was intended to be a children's book, to stretch it out like that with bad CGI is to desecrate the book. I can understand having a bad movie. But these Hobbit movie \"interpretations\" are just appalling in every facet.",

Scott Peck, to a big budget movie. I saw the trailer and was hoping for a serious drama, but it turned out to be this weird mix of melodrama, horror, comedy, and sci-fi\u2026 all of which made absolutely zero sense. Another one is The Long Goodbye, by Raymond Chandler, which was adapted into a movie with the weird title The Long Goodbye: A Philip Marlowe Adventure. I heard they cut a lot of dialogue and other details, so what is left is fairly confusing unless you really understand the character of Phillip Marlowe. Lastly, a book called The Good Earth by Pearl Suckley. It\u2019s one of those books that is easy to read, yet also contains some really beautiful writing, great",

I've been in that sort of fandom before, and sometimes your fandom's going to disappoint you, because it's a business ultimately aiming for some level of profit, and if a business needs a big budget and it doesn't meet the profit it was hyped to, it might need to pull out for a few years, which happens a lot with streaming. I don't think it's an immediate write off yet, and I hope there's enough value to keep",

Edmund Dant\u00e8s was my hero and I could feel Alexander Dumas' descriptions of the sea and sky and wind as much as I felt his characters' emotions. Then I saw the movie. That was a huge disappointment. I found out a 1998 TV show based on the book existed and I finally watched it recently. I was very cautious and ended up loving it. I think because there were more episodes they really did an excellent job. Maybe a movie was too short to do the story justice. (but also I hate watching movies with subtitles).",

Like at all ever like the idea of these characters at all. And I'm not even a beautiful woman. I'm far from an ugly woman either. I've not even dated the lead actor at the time. It was honestly so cringy in a 50 shades of grey type of way. It also had to have been the worst depiction of anxiety I've ever seen.

It's a very wholesome and heartwarming story, but also the characters' personal stories and the characters themselves are so wonderfully built that I could not believe the TV show completely turned the story on its head (aside from the main plot of a little American girl running away to Venice with a little French boy, everything else is different... The way they meet, why they decide to go to Venice, the character development and especially the end bits are all done completely differently) :-(!",
