    "content": "Just wondering what movie version of a book that you really liked completely let you down. For me, the one that comes to mind the most is A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. My wife and I have both read the book multiple times. Bryson is a great writer and the book is charming, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny. The movie lacked all of those qualities.",

I don't even know why they would even try; it was a really dull, uninspiring, paint-by-numbers script, and I can only assume the books were probably even more stilted, and that there was a bigger focus on politics, and less action/romance. Like the people who tried to adapt the game of thrones books into the final season, and thought they could just skip some stuff to get to the big exciting stuff faster, it just came off as stupid and kind of lazy.",

But when I hear you read a story, my mind works in a different way. It's more of an auditory sense, and my ability to see the images and details is less developed - it's actually not at all. I'm very familiar with words and language, especially English and my native Dutch, and I'm not someone who has to read everything to understand it (so I don't need it to be on paper). But my brain doesn't produce images when you read to me the way my brain will when I read something. I'm trying to use my words right. There actually are some rare people who can describe in detail what they see in their mind when they hear a story read aloud. And they can do so easily. In some cases,",

The characters are all just people in this big world, and that makes them easy for us to understand. But then we are shown how easy it is to wipe entire species, races, civilizations off the map. We shouldn't have any problem understanding a humanoid invasion. But then we see what it does to the human race, to our whole species. We're easily conquered, and if we somehow win it's hollow.

I love the books because, I understand Creation... then there are the books, with all the allegory woven through them, all the hidden, not-so-hidden messages, and suddenly I have a better understanding of the story of the world and how God operates in it. Then I watch the movies with their complete allegory and hidden messages missing, which is sad to watch because I can see the potential for something great and deep, but sadly it seems like an attempt to be Harry Potter without the underlying message... and it fails.\\xa0",

He did not want to write them, he hated working on them, and he hated it. The Hobbit was a simple tale written for his kids to read during family gatherings during winter, it was never meant to be the world breaking phenomenon that it has since become. The other books were basically a huge piece of work, which was not needed in terms of the simple morals he tried to express.",

They were just awful. I went into the theatre with my wife ready to rant. It was awful enough she wanted to go home, and I had watched it without her. I had a bad feeling then. I also hadn't realised it was being panned but it didn't seem to be a rave review, but just reviews said 'Oh the fans will love it' and I liked the book. But i didnt. If that had been the only version I had seen, it would have killed the movie for me. I do not give away my review. But i don't usually review or mention the book or movie until i've read/seen both at least twice. I don't review stuff i am going to read because I do it so often so",

I like watching it when I'm hungover because it's long and the characters talk very slowly which means I'll be passed out well before I finish it. It does, of course, have some excellent scenes, and the cast is very strong, but overall it's not very good from a filmaking standpoint. I haven't seen the 2019 miniseries, but I will eventually. I just haven't, for whatever reason. I wouldn't count them as the best adaptations but the Lord of the Rings movies are still some of the best scifi/fantasy movies ever made, and ASOIAF is probably the best modern fantasy series, and both have great adaptations. As much as I like Tolkien's books, I don't think the movies are better than the books, but they are excellent",

But the only thing memorable about it was \"Four scores and seven years ago...\" (for context, that should be the Gettysburg address, and it was about 120 years earlier). It was so dumb that I had no sympathy for the protagonist when his story hit the supernatural stuff (or rather, when it turned into a superhero origin story), because he was so stupid and unlikeable.

The movies feel so much more\u2026 \u201ccartoonish?\u201d than the books themselves. The book series, by the 6th book, seems very adult. And while each movie is technically well made on its own, I don\u2019t really know how they could have managed to get all that magic and depth into a movie series. Maybe it was because they were trying to appeal to a wider audience, but they somehow just lost the magic in the process. Harry even loses his depth!",

I particularly like that he goes out of his way to give shout-outs to lots of other writers' works. I'm in my early 40s, and have read so many of the works he incorporates and enjoys in that series. He definitely has a flair for style and a lot of skill as a writer, not to mention the sheer gonzo brilliance of his plots. Absolutely a fan of his and wish there were more people around who had read and understood his work!",

Unfortunately, it failed to get to grips with the premise that a vampire who doesn't want to eat humans isn't that interesting. So it failed to deliver on the things that the Twilight books did well, but not that much on the things they did badly either. (The storyline where the vampire and the human girl get together is not well handled at all, and the \"boyband of vampires\" who are trying to kill the girl have so little charisma as a group that nothing they do is interesting either.) As for those who hated the books but loved the film: well, at least a good film of the Little Vampire was made.",

My only complaints are that all the references to his dad and him being from Canada were completely removed. And I really do miss the old way of saying \"Bass\" but other than that I didn't mind the changes/additions. In the book when Christopher leaves his room I remember laughing about how he says to himself that nobody could know he was awake. I thought it was kind of amusing to think about what his face would look like if you actually caught him talking to himself. In the movie the camera angle makes it seem like just his lips were moving. In the movie, his parents react like they didn't notice which I feel like they would not react that way.",
