I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

Another funny one I've been enjoying is David Sedaris' collection of essays, 'Me Talk Pretty One Day'. If you're looking for something a bit more fact-based, Bill Bryson's 'I'm a Stranger Here Myself' also delivers plenty of chuckles.",

But if we're looking for non-Pratchett, I'd also recommend David Sedaris and Bill Bryson. \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\" by Sedaris is a collection of essays that are often hilarious and observationally astute. As for Bryson, \"A Walk in the Woods\" and \"Neither Here Nor There\" are both great reads for a good chuckle. Now, if we're talking about fiction, I can't help but think of \"A Confederacy of Dunces\" by John Kennedy Toole. Its protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, is a bumbling everyman who is so absurdly funny that he's almost tragic. And while we're on the subject of tragedy, how about J.D. Salinger's \"Catcher in the Rye",

As for those that still make me laugh after all these years, \"Lemony Snicket: A Series of Unfortunate Events\" is a fantastic pick. The sarcastic tone and dark humor are spot on, especially when you've read them several times. Another one I love is \"Jumping Off Swings\" by Jo Walton. It's a coming-of-age story filled with wit and humor. I reread both of these series almost annually, and they never fail to make",

The humor is so crude and silly that it never gets old! The illustrations are also a big part of its charm. My favorite part is when George and Harold hypnotize their mean principal into becoming Captain Underpants and causing chaos at school. What book never fails to make you chuckle?",

I found it absolutely hilarious, and it's still on my list of books to re-read for a good laugh. I can relate to some of the strange incidents she describes in her book, and her humor is just spot on. Another great book that's bound to make you chuckle is Bossypants by Tina Fey. It's full of sarcastic wit and funny anecdotes from her life and career. And if you haven't read it already, I highly recommend Grady Hendrix's How to Sell a Haunted House. I'm currently reading it myself and I can't help but laugh at the clever humor and creative plot.",

The main character is so so so funny and the jokes are so modern while also paying homage to the clowns and vaudevillians of the past.

To be honest, I totally get where you're coming from regarding \"A Confederacy of Dunces.\" The main character and his antics can be a bit tough to stomach, and I've often found myself cringing more than chuckling. But if you're looking for something a bit lighter and more endearing, I'd highly recommend \"I Want To Go Home\" by Gordon Korman. It's about a teenager who escapes from an island summer camp he didn't want to attend, and the protagonist's incessant musings never fail to crack me up. Hope you find something you love soon!",

Another funny one, although a bit more lighthearted, is Gordon Korman's I Want To Go Home. It's about a teenager who escapes from summer camp and his comments are hilarious! I read it at least once a year just for the laughs. \n\n        P.S. Here's my confession: I also re-read We Have Always Lived in the Castle.

The whole book is a masterclass in absurdity, but that scene always gets me. I love how Yossarian manages to turn the psychiatrist's assumptions back on him. I've read it a dozen times, and it still never fails to make me laugh. As for my own favorite, I still can't get enough of I Want to Go Home. That book is just perfect for a good laugh!",

The book's commentary on the absurdity and nonsense of war really resonated with me, and I still find myself chuckling when I think about certain scenes, like the one where Yossarian is trying to get out of flying more missions and concocts an elaborate lie with Orr and Nately.",

I always enjoy Mark Twain's irreverent humor and unique perspective on the past, and this novel is no exception. The scenes where the protagonist, Hank Morgan, tries to modernize medieval England are quite amusing and help make the book a classic that still elicits laughs today. Thanks for sharing your favorite funny books, and I'm thrilled to see a few of mine on this list as well!\n        Here are some more: \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" by George Orwell - hilarious if you can find the humor in bleak dystopian societies, and \"Catch-22\" by Joseph Heller - which is just plain absurd and funny in its own right.\"",

I found the book 'Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal' by Christopher Moore quite amusing when I first read it, and it still tickles me. It's a whimsical look at Jesus' life through a character named Biff, his childhood friend. I also really enjoyed 'Emma' by Jane Austen for its witty dialogue and characters. Reading books that are not only fun to read but have a good balance of humor and substance always make for a great read.",

I've been called a nerd before, quite often as you can well imagine. If I have read it, and am familiar with the above made references, I might have missed it, but it's still a brilliantly written tight little nugget not to be missed. Even twice.
