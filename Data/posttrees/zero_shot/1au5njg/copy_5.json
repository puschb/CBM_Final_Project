I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

The humor is just silly and brilliant, making me laugh out loud every time I read them. \n        \n         In \"The Color of Magic\", Discworld is a flat world supported by four elephants who are standing on the back of a giant turtle named Great A'Tuin. That's already absurd and hilarious, but then you have the character Twoflower, who's an extraordinarily incurious tourist from a country full of magic and wizards, and the discworld's main protagonist Rincewind, who's a failed wizard. Twoflower and Rincewind's antics together never fail to make me giggle.\n\n         As for \"Mort\", it's about",

One that never fails to tickle my funbone is Sir Terry Pratchett's work, especially his Discworld series. The witty satire and intricate humor always manage to leave me in stitches. It's tough to pick a favorite, but if I must, I'd have to go with \"The Colour of Magic\". The way it introduces the Discworld with a hilarious blend of absurdity and logic has me revisiting this book time and time again. Cheers to Pratchett for his literary masterpieces! \ud83d\ude09\nUser 0: \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

In terms of books that still make me laugh, I'd have to say the humor in Bill Bryson's books never gets old, much like the humor in Gordon Korman's I Want To Go Home.\n\n         I especially love how Bill Bryson's wit and humor shine in books like A Short History of Nearly Everything, where he dives deep into various scientific topics while providing an hilariously entertaining take on some of the more absurd aspects of science. It's a refreshing blend of learning and laughter that keeps me coming back for more!\n\n         Another favorite",

Plus Evelyn Waugh is a genius when it comes to writing dialogue!\n\n        I think the humor in Waugh's works (and in particular \"Vile Bodies\") lies in its exaggerated portrayal of human behavior, especially the foolishness and absurdity of the upper class, something that still resonates today.

The Golf Omnibus, along with the other short story collections, are certainly some of my favorites for a good laugh. The characters and their hapless attempts to play golf are always amusing, even when they inadvertently get themselves into tricky situations. I also enjoy the intricate plots involving the various relations, rivalries, and misunderstandings that occur within and outside the golf club.

It's a hilarious and eye-opening account of the author's time spent living among the Korowai, a cannibalistic tribe in Papua New Guinea. I've also long been a fan of Christopher Moore, particularly \"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal.\" Moore has a knack for blending humor and religion in a way that keeps me entertained and thinking. I'd definitely add these books to my re-read list!",

The satire and absurdity of that book still holds up, even after multiple readings. I also enjoy Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, which is filled with humor and satire, as well as Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five.

I still have the ISBN numbers if you need them, for good measure. \ud83d\ude00 Keep reading and enjoy! All my best -J-",

It's fascinating to see such a varied range of perspectives on humor, but Heller's dark and witty narrative captures my laughter every single time. In addition to 'Catch 22,' I'd like to toss in 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' by Douglas Adams. It's the perfect mix of absurdity, satire, and pure zany hilarity. Reading it always brings a smile to my face, even in the grimmest of times.*\n\n         *Another book that consistently provokes chuckles is 'Fool Moon' by Jim Butcher. It's urban fantasy done right, with some unexpected humor thrown in for good measure. I love the way Butcher weaves wit and sarcasm into the narrative, making his characters end",
