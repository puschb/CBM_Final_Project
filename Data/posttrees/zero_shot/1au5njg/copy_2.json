I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

The humor is unique and the ridiculousness of the plot never fails to amuse me. It's about an intergalactic guide that is meant to have all the answers, but is often humorously inaccurate. My favorite line is when they discover a new phenomenon and they add it to the guidebook as \"unable to compute\".\n        \n        \n        (It's probably appropriate for me to include a reminder that even though The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy was conceived by two Brits, it takes place in a fictional universe and is meant to be funny. I'm not trying to argue that books originating from places that don't have legal rights to a name are less humorous.)",

His books are a great source of laughter, especially his Myth Adams series and the Phases ofate World series. I still find myself chuckling while reading them, and they never seem to lose their humor. If anyone else hasn't given those a try, give them a read! But if you're looking for something a bit lighter, maybe start with one of the shorter, quirkier books - like \"The Rational Living Handbook\" by Robert Asprin & J.R.R.R. Tolkien. :)",

Glad to see more comedic novels out there though, it's refreshing to have something that can put a smile on my face. Keep the recommendations coming, people!",

As for a book that's really incredibly sad, I'd recommend \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" by Stephen Chbosky. The novel deals with some heavy themes like depression, homosexuality, and abuse, but it's also touching, funny, and incredibly relatable for many readers. I think it's a must-read for anyone looking for a funny book with a layer of sadness. Lacey's book sounds interesting too, it must be hilarious! \ud83d\ude0a",

I found it repetitive and the main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, to be annoying and unlikeable.\n\n        I've never read The Sellout by Paul Beatty, but after reading this thread, I'm curious to give it a try. The humor and satire sound right up my alley!\n\n        In the meantime, I'll stick to books that make me laugh outright like Gordon Korman's I Want to Go Home. It's a bit silly, but it still brings me happiness and a good laugh!",

His wit and humor shine through in many of his works. *Roughing It* is a funny read, indeed. I've read it a couple of times, and it still puts a smile on my face.\n\n        Another book that never fails to make me chuckle is *Gulliver's Travels* by Jonathan Swift. The Brobdingnagians and the Houyhnhnms are simply amusing to me.\n\n        It's great to share laughter over books. The connection and camaraderie they create are truly heartwarming! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf19\u2728\n\n        \ud83d\udc4d 10 upvotes, 10 comments\n\n        \ud83d\udcac User responses",

The antics of Peter Hatcher and Fudge in 'Superfudge' never fail to elicit a good laugh, and I still remember reading 'Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing' and being entertained by Peter's exploits.

The rhymes and illustrations are just Gold.\n        \n        3.

If you prefer humor with a bit of romance, I'd say Helen Fielding's \"Bridget Jones' Diary\" takes the cake. And, if you're into mystery, Carl Hiaasen's \"Stormy Weather\" is a storm of laughs. All three books have stood the test of time and still manage to put a smile on my face. They're like old friends you can always rely on to make you laugh. \ud83d\ude03\"\n        \n        -/u/kittens234",

Another book that makes me chuckle is \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. The humor in that book is more light-hearted and silly, but it's still really funny. I think the key to a good laugh in literature is a well-written character who's relatable or has a unique perspective on the world, and a clever storyline. It's like they say, there's nothing new under the sun, but the tale is in the telling. And shout out to Brian Regan, he's one of my favorites for light-hearted, clean humor. Happy reading! :)",
