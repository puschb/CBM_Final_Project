I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

I'll have to check out \"I Want To Go Home.\" It sounds like a fun read!\n        \n        Another book that always makes me laugh is \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. It's just so witty and absurd, and I love the characters. I find myself quoting it all the time.\n        \n        On a more serious note, I love \"The Catcher in the Rye\" by J.D. Salinger. It's not a laughing matter, but the protagonist's voice and attitude always resonate with me. It's a classic for a reason.\n        \n        Anyway, I'm always open to book recommendations, so if you have any more, I'd love to hear them!",

Guards!. The humor is clever and the worldbuilding is fantastic. Plus, all the characters have distinct voices and personalities that make for a lot of entertaining interactions. If you haven't read them, I would highly recommend giving them a try! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0",

But don't forget Dave Barry's books like \"Dave Barry Does Japan\" or \"Dave Barry Turns 40\", the laughs are guaranteed!\n\n         As for funny nonfiction, I've thoroughly enjoyed \"Talking to Strangers\" by Malcolm Gladwell, it's not a laugh-out-loud book but there is a lot to appreciate in his insights while still finding humor in the situations he presents.",

Stine, which is a collection of spooky stories intended for young audiences, just doesn't get old for me. It's the kind of book where the humor comes from the over-the-top, absurd situations, and I love that about it.

His utter disregard for morality and his absurdity are truly comical. It's a scene that's been stuck in my head for years. But, of course, humor is subjective, and what makes one person laugh might not make another person giggle. As Shakespeare once said, \"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!\"",

It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs. <<ANSWER>> I haven't read Gordon Korman, but after your great recommendation, I'll definitely pick up some of his books next time I'm searching for some light-hearted reads.

I recently finished The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion and it made me laugh pretty much the entire way through. I find Don Tillman\u2019s social awkwardness and logic-driven life incredibly relatable, and his quest to find the perfect wife is both absurd and moving. Highly recommend it if you enjoy a good laugh while also getting a little bit of heart thrown in.",

He has this over-the-top, pompous sense of self-importance that just tickles me every time I read it. Another book that always puts a smile on my face is \"A walk in the woods\" by Bill Bryson. His observations and descriptions on the Appalachian Trail are hilarious, yet also insightful and informative.

It's always fun to find humor in literature, and it sounds like this book provides that for you. I can relate to finding humor in unexpected places in books.\n\n        3) I'm not familiar with \"Hooked\" by Michael Moss, but I'm intrigued.

So, while Cormac McCarthy's books might not be laugh-out-loud funny, they definitely have their moments. \n        \n        I still think Gordon Korman's books, and especially \"I Want To Go Home\", have that kind of humor going on consistently, though, which I find endlessly amusing! \ud83d\ude0a",

On a slightly different note, I also love A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. It's a funny account of Bryson's attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail and his misadventures along the way. It's a great blend of humor and adventure that I find incredibly refreshing.\n\n        3. Lastly, if you haven't already read it, check out The Life of Pi by Yann Martel.

                    "comment_text": "I have read \"Catch 22\" and it is indeed a hilarious book. The dark humor in it is a great change of pace from the lighter books like Gordon Korman's that you mentioned. I have to admit, I don't read it as often as I Want To Go Home, but I remember the laughter it brought me the first time I read it. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the books that make us laugh - it's always great to hear about new ones to add to our reading lists! \ud83d\ude04\n\n         P.S. I haven't read \"The Sisters Brothers\" or anything by Mary Roach yet, but hearing your recommendations makes me excited to pick them up sometime! Cheers to keeping the library well-stocked with great reads! \ud83d\ude0a",
