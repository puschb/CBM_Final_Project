I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

It's a dark comedy that skewers consumerism and the suburban lifestyle with sharp, biting wit. If only all self-help books could be this entertaining!",

They're right up there with Douglas Adams, Pratchett, Vonnegut, and the rest of the usual suspects.

(If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.\n        \n        But, I'm just gonna say Pratchett too before anyone else gets to this thread. The footnotes in so many of his books, particularly the Discworld series, are just laugh",

It's a humorous account of three friends on a boat trip down the River Thames and the misadventures they encounter along the way. It's a classic that still holds up today and it's a great read when you need a good laugh.`",

I particularly love the Guide Dictionary, it's always amusing to see some hilarious definitions like \"A common misconception is that work is required to achieve anything of value. What is really happening is that time and effort are being wasted without anything of value being achieved.\"\n\n        Third response (in response to the second one): Haha, brilliant observation!

I look forward to giving it a read! Keep in mind, though, that I'm not quite as fond of contemporary humor as I am with Gordon Korman. His books have a special place in my heart that not many other authors can reach. For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book every time I re-read it. It's about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend. I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs. \n\n        Intriguing how we find different sources for laughter, huh?

When it comes to re-reading books, I do the same thing as you - I read a book and then I like to re-read it to see how it's structured. It's interesting to see the author's writing style and technique. I imagine Three Men in a Boat would still be just as enjoyable when re-reading. Thanks for the recommendation!\n        \n        [P.S. I also have to agree with the other commenter about Anna.

As for The Sellout, it sounds like a creative and funny exploration of race and identity in contemporary America. Maybe I'll have to add those to my reading list!\n        \n        On a side note, I also enjoy Christopher Moore's books if anyone is in need of more laugh-out-loud titles. \"A Dirty Job\" is one of my favorites, as it blends dark humor and paranormal elements in a unique way.

A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman: This book is just so relatable and heartwarming, but Ove's eccentricities are absolutely hysterical. From the way he organizes his trash cans to his obsession with IKEA instruction manuals, I can't help but laugh every time I read it.\n\n        2. Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman: This book has a unique sense of humor that I love. Eleanor's dry wit and observation of her own life situations will have you rolling with laughter. It's a great combination of dark humor and heartfelt moments.\n\n        3. Catch-22 by Joseph Heller: This book is iconic for its satirical commentary on the military and war, but it's Yossarian",

It's a great book, but there's something about it that lacks the spark of originality found in so many other books. Still, it's a fun read, and I can see why people enjoy it.

Throughout the book, Adams cleverly satirizes not only sci-fi tropes but also human behavior and society as a whole. I haven't re-read it for a while, but when I do, it still strikes me as funny and interesting.\n\n         Another book that I find entertaining is A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole. It tells the story of Ignatius J. Reilly, a eccentric and overweight young man in New Orleans, and his misadventures. The humor in this book is subtle yet devastating and the character development is fantastic. Even though it is",

I love books that make me laugh and both the titles you mentioned seem to fit that bill. The premise of Lamb is so quirky and unique that I bet it would be a real hoot. As for Emma, I've always heard it's a classic and I think the humor in Regency-era literature can be delightful. I'll have to add them to my TBR pile!",

            "comment_text": ">\"I Want To Go Home\" definitely takes the cake for me in terms of books that make me laugh, but I must admit that Kurt Vonnegut's \"Welcome to the Monkey House\" is another one that never fails to tickle my funny bone. His unique style and sharp wit just resonate so well with me. If you have a chance to read it, I highly recommend it! - [J]",

I've always found Joseph Heller's dark humor to be brilliant and still find myself laughing as I re-read it. It's a classic for a reason! I also love the irreverent humor in The Sisters Brothers. In fact, I have a soft spot for dark humor in literature. I've discovered that Mary Roach's books, especially Stiff and Bonk, have quite a bit of that. They're a bit outside my usual reading range, but she's a fantastic writer who has a knack for finding humor in unexpected medical situations. I'd definitely recommend checking her out! Thanks for sharing your favorite laugh-out-loud books! -J-",
