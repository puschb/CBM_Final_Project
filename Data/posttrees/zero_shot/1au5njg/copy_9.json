I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

The protagonist's constant attempts to escape the island summer camp are just so absurd and ridiculous, and it's hard not to laugh at them. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a light-hearted, laugh-out-loud read.",

Jerome to the list. These books still catch my smile every time I re-read them. Oh, and let's not forget \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. It's a brilliant intergalactic comedy!",

This book is not just a page-turning adventure, but also an insightful exploration of love, friendship, and acceptance. You might find yourself giggling, smiling, or even laughing out loud at the absurd situations our protagonist finds himself in. It's another title I've revisited over time, and it never lets me down.

It's a hilarious memoir about his time spent on a remote island in Micronesia in the late 80s. Another one is \"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal\" by Christopher Moore, which offers a humorous and imaginative take on Jesus Christ's early life. Can't forget to mention \"A Walk in the Woods\" by Bill Bryson, a classic travelogue filled with ridiculous encounters and self-deprecating humor as he attempts to hike the Appalachian Trail. Cheers to books that bring a smile to our faces!",

Even though these characters are deeply depressing and unpleasant, they remain amusing due to the over-the-top narration.

It's a wonderfully satirical novel that deals with race, and it's definitely one of the most polarizing books I've read, in that people either love or hate it, just like Confederacy of Dunces!",

I made no mention of the user's history of buying books faster than reading them, as it did not seem relevant to the comment of interest. The response is not exact",

But if we're talking something a bit more comedic and lighthearted, Terry Pratchett's Discworld series is a must-read. The character Death, as he navigates a world where he's the odd one out, is just... perfection. I couldn't help but laugh out loud every time I read it. And who wouldn't want to convince a British girl that eating a cobra on her birthday is required, eh? Just imagine the puzzled yet amused expression on her face! \ud83d\ude02",

The twist at the end is quite a doozy.\n\n        \n        On a lighter note, I also really enjoyed \"A Walk in the Woods\" by Bill Bryson. It's a memoir about Bryson's attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail, but he's not exactly a hardcore hiker, and the book is full of self-deprecating humor that I found entertaining. I've read it a few times and it always puts me in a good mood.\n\n        \n        I also want to give a mention to \"The Hitchh",

I also appreciate the light-heartedness in Gordon Korman's works. If you haven't read The Story of Edgar Sawtelle by Wroblewski, I'd definitely recommend adding it to your list as well. There's just something about well-written, thought-provoking literature that resonates deeply with us, even long after we've read it. In the meantime, happy reading!",

It's set in the 1920s and follows an ambitious and spirited woman named Bess Crawford who serves as a nurse during World War I. Though she returns to England, she finds herself constantly drawn back into solving mysteries, despite her best efforts to avoid them. One of my favorite books in the series, \"A Forged Alibi,\" has Bess investigating a murder at a party where she is the only one who sees the victim's body. Everyone else thinks she's just being her usual dramatic self, and she must navigate social conventions while trying to uncover the truth. I find Bess's dry wit and determination to find justice despite the obstacles hilarious and always look forward to revisiting her stories.",

If I Want To Go Home is as funny as you say, I might have to give it a try. Reading a good book always makes my day a little brighter!\n\n        BTW, I'm also a fan of The Age of Innocence and The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton, but The Custom of the Country seemed to miss the mark for me. I can see why you found it insufferable. Have you read any of her other books? I'd love to hear your thoughts on them as well!\n\n        On a side note, I'm also someone who prefers a physical book to an e-book, though I don't have any qualms with reading e-books if that's what's available.

That book is such a hilarious take on the life of Jesus and His friends. I think it's because Moore writes with such a light-hearted touch, even when he's tackling heavy subject matter.\n\n         Another classic that makes me laugh every time is Emma by Jane Austen. Her witty dialogue and keen observations about human nature always crack me up, even though it's almost 200 years old!\n\n         I also enjoyed rereading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams. That books are just full of absurdity, smart humor, and a quick-wit dialogue that makes you laugh out loud.\n\n         When I'm in the mood for something more contemporary, I turn to David Sedaris for a good chuckle.

            "comment_text": "> *The book that makes me laugh every time I read it is \"Galapagos\" by Kurt Vonnegut. It's a darkly satirical novel set in the future where an island's inhabitants survive a worldwide flu outbreak and evolve physically but not mentally. I find Vonnegut's sharp wit and social commentary hilarious and the absurdity of the premise never fails to amuse me. Even though it was first published in 1985, it still remains as relevant today as it was then. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and humorous read.*",

The humor in that book is just so absurd and funny. Plus, it's part of a series so there's tons to read! Have you read anything by Christopher Moore? \"A Dirty Job\" and \"Lamb\" are both really funny. I'd definitely recommend giving them a try if you haven't already!\n        \n        \n        -A fellow bibliophile",
