I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

It's always a subjective matter, but I think there are certain books that transcend the genre boundaries and are universally appreciated for their artistic merit. For instance, 'Catch-22' by Joseph Heller still makes me laugh out loud whenever I read it. The absurdity of war and the satirical take on the military bureaucracy is brilliantly portrayed, and the dry humor is timeless. I find myself re-reading certain parts just for the humor.\"*",

And don't forget to check out David Sedaris for his witty and often humorous essays.\n\n        I guess my recommendation for a mix of humor and deep emotions would be Hornby's High Fidelity and Sedaris's Me Talk Pretty One Day. They're definitely worth a read if you're looking for a good laugh and some insightful reflections on life.",

The protagonist, Scudder, is a detective with the Maine state police who has a penchant for barbecue. When a body turns up with an unusual wound, Scudder deduces that the killer used a unique blade and tries a variety of recipes to find a match. He eventually tracks down the perpetrator but not before trying all sorts of exotic and weird dishes. The dialogue, characters, and situations are all extremely witty, and I find myself re-reading this book for a laugh whenever I need one.",

It took me years, for instance, to make it 1-5% into Blood Meridian. I'm still not sure if I'm built for books like that.\n\n        I hope this doesn't seem insensitive, but if you have similar issues with re-reading those not-so-cheerful books, audiobooks can be a fantastic alternative! It's a great way to revisit your favorite stories without getting too overwhelmed by the grim details. Keep on laughing, my friend! \ud83d\ude03\n\n        (p.s If you are interested, my age-related issue I meant with re-reading Hitchhiker's Guide was that the humor didn't connect with me as well as it did when I was",

For me, I found \"Catch-22\" by Joseph Heller to be much funnier when I was younger, but it still had its moments when I re-read it a few years ago. The absurdity of the characters and the absurdity of war in general still make me chuckle, but the political satire and subtext didn't resonate as much with me as it did when I was younger. It's still a great book, though, and I can see why it's been such a classic for so many years. If you haven't given it a re-read yet, it might be worth giving it another shot.

I re-read it every few years, and it never fails to bring a smile to my face. The unique blend of absurdity and satire in Douglas Adams' writing is one of a kind.\n\n         And speaking of chuckles, I Want To Go Home is also another book that always gives me a good laugh. The main character's relentless attempts to escape the island summer camp are quite amusing! I find myself grinning from ear to ear as I read through his comments.\n\n         I'd say both books have a special place in my heart for their amazing sense of humor. \ud83d\ude0a Cheers to many more laughs with these books!",

Plus, it's a unique travelogue with fascinating cultural insights.\n\n         Another book that always puts a smile on my face is _Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal_ by Christopher Moore. It's a brilliant reimagining of Jesus' childhood from the perspective of an unlikely best friend named Biff. Both of these books are fantastic picks for some giggles and a good read!",

Maarten Troost's unexpected stint as a peace corps volunteer in Kiribati and his experience with the locals and their unique customs. The humor is crude but hilarious, and I find myself laughing out loud every time I read it. \"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal\" by Christopher Moore is also a must-read if you enjoy humor in literature. It offers a satirical take on the life of Jesus from the perspective of Biff, his childhood friend. It's a fun, imaginative read!",

It's absurd, witty, and just outright hilarious. The main character's constant frustrations and the absurdity of the alien species he encounters always make me smile.\n        \n        Reading these books helps me forget about my troubles and just enjoy the absurdity of life for a while.

It's about a college freshman who's an obsessive fan of a popular Sci-Fi/Fantasy book series and has a tough time adjusting to her new life. There are some really funny moments throughout that book which still make me chuckle when I think about them.

Luckily, author George MacDonald Fraser, who clearly knew a thing or two about humorous storytelling, realized he could use the character to undermine himself.  He and writer Paul Verhoeven turned what were originally earnest anecdotes of Flashman's adventures among the British military into something uncanny and over-the-top.  \u201cAll the way through I wanted the audience to be asking, 'Is this character really so charming and unapologetically self-serving?' Flashman in the Great Game is still entertaining in other settings, just not quite the same IMO.*",

'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' by Douglas Adams comes to mind. The humor is clever, witty and surprisingly relatable even amidst the sci-fi fantasies. The humor is one of the reasons I keep revisiting that series.\"",

            "comment_text": "> I haven't read any books by Gordon Korman, but from your description of \"I Want To Go Home,\" it sounds like a fun read. As for a book that still makes me laugh, I can't help but mention Kurt Vonnegut's \"Breakfast of Champions.\" It's a novel about a character named Kilgore Trout, who is a science fiction writer, and he is often the subject of jokes and ridicule. I find his character and the way Vonnegut weaves his writings into the narrative to be laugh-out-loud funny. I can re-read this book every few years and still find it amusing. If you haven't read Vonnegut before, I'd definitely recommend giving him a try! Maybe \"Breakfast of Champions\" will be the book that makes you laugh for years to come.\n        \n         > P.S. I've read Vonnegut's",

They're always filled with surprising twists and jokes that make you laugh despite the serious subject matter. It's like she's found the funniest bits of scientific research and presented them in the most entertaining way possible. Definitely recommend checking them out!",
