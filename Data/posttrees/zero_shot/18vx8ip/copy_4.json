With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

The more you read, the more your mental library grows. Even if you don't remember every single detail, the overall context and themes often stick with you. Plus, revisiting or discussing books with others can help jog your memory and deepen your understanding. Reading also trains your brain to learn and process information more efficiently, which can have beneficial effects in other areas of life as well.\"\n\n--------\n\nPossible variations:\n\n\"Definitely. While some details may fade, the big ideas and broader contexts of books you read tend to stick with you. Plus, as you accumulate more books and knowledge, your brain becomes better at making connections and understanding complex ideas.\"\n\n\"I definitely don't forget everything I read. I'd say that",

Personally, I've been devouring books since I was twelve, so my reading speed is not necessarily a measure of anyone else's capabilities. But yeah, it does seem to be the case that most novels are around 8 hours for audiobooks, and some people actually read faster than that. It all depends on the book. Some are light and you fly through them even if they are huge. Other 250 page books take forever to read. So I suppose it does come down to finding the right books for you, managing your time effectively, and finding an interesting audiobook performance. Cheers!",

Been an platinum audible subscriber since 2003 (Jesus Christ, 21 years now. Wow). If a book is less than 10 hours, I will generally avoid it unless it's by an author or a narrator I really like. Audio books are the way to go. I can clean, cook, exercise, or drive while listening and still knock out multiple books a week. Plus, the narrators can bring a story to life in a way no one else can.

For me, long space operas fit the bill in terms of both time and enjoyment, but there are definitely some shorter books that are worth a read every now and then.

I don't find short books or audio books to be any less satisfying. In fact, I often feel like a longer book can drag on and become tedious to get through. I listen to a pretty wide variety of genres, but as you can probably guess, I enjoy sci-fi and space operas the most. And yes, audio books can make a bad book tolerable and a great novel intolerable.

The advice in the thread emphasizes the importance of finding what one likes to read and enjoying the process, rather than focusing on speed or quantity alone.",

Counting children's books as worthwhile reads is a smart move that I hadn't considered, and it's especially interesting since they can serve as cultural references. Another category to consider might be young adult books, which can also be quick and entertaining reads, and may not require as much processing time as other genres. I personally enjoy romance novels as well, simply because they can be straightforward and easy to follow.

This allows you to stay engaged with a variety of genres and makes it easier to continue reading when you hit a dull spot in one book.\n        3. Set aside specific time each day for reading, such as during your commute, lunch break, or before bed. Make it a consistent habit.\n        4. Choose books with shorter word counts. Classic novels or dense works of literature may require more time and mental energy to digest.\n        5. Listen to audiobooks during your free time, such as while exercising or cooking. This allows you to \"read\" more books per day without requiring extra time.\n        6. Utilize summary resources, such as SparkNotes or CliffsNotes, to help comprehend complex works of literature more quickly.\n        7.",

I don't necessarily read for hours at a time, but I prioritize it in my schedule, and I always make time for it. If you're looking for a hobby that requires less time commitment, I'd suggest finding a local book club or engaging in online discussions about books.

Remove unnecessary apps: I deleted most of the social media apps from my phone. I found that these apps were a major contributor to my phone usage, and removing them helped a lot.\n\n3. Use phone management tools: There are apps like Freedom, Forest, and Space that can help you limit your phone usage. For example, Forest makes you grow a tree by not using your phone, and if you use it, the tree dies.\n\n4. Keep a book nearby: Have your book somewhere accessible. If you see it often and find it easy to reach for, you're more likely to read instead of pick up your",

Personally, I've found the following strategies helpful for reducing unnecessary phone time and increasing reading:\n\n        1. Set boundaries: Designate specific times every day to read for pleasure, and stick to that schedule. Make it a sacred ritual, if you will.\n\n        2. Put your phone away when you read: If it's not within arm's reach, you're less likely to pick it up. Put it in a different room, use a bookmark that requires you to keep the book open, or use an app that limits your phone usage during your reading hours.\n\n        3. Find a accountability partner: Share your reading goals with friends, family, or colleagues, and have them check in with you regularly. Having someone cheering you on and holding you accountable makes it more enjoyable and less daunting.\n\n        4. Reread favorite books: Instead",

This way, you can limit the time you spend on your phone for non-essential activities. Set specific reading times for yourself, just as you would with watching TV or a movie, and stick to it. You can also take advantage of apps like Forest, which encourages focus by creating a virtual garden that grows as you stay on-task, or Cold Turkey Blocker, which blocks distracting websites and apps during your designated reading times. Above all, be patient with yourself and recognize that forming new habits takes time and effort. Small steps, like swapping a social media app for an ebook reader, can contribute to a significant reduction in phone usage over time.",

For example, you could limit yourself to 30 minutes of social media browsing each day, or only use your phone during breaks at work.\n\n        2. Find alternative activities to replace phone usage. If you find yourself reaching for your phone out of habit, try finding a new activity to do instead. This could be reading, exercising, playing an instrument, or even doing a puzzle.\n\n        3. Keep your phone out of reach. Putting your phone in another room or turning on airplane mode can help reduce the temptation to check it constantly.\n\n        4. Deactivate notifications.

It's a constant struggle to put our phones down and focus on other things, especially something as immersive as reading. Here are a few tips that have helped me reduce phone time and increase reading time:\n\n        1. Set a daily reading goal: This gives you something tangible to work towards and can make it easier to resist the pull of your phone.\n\n        2. Designate specific reading times: Choose designated blocks of time each day for reading, and stick to them as much as possible.\n\n        3. Turn off notifications: Silencing notifications will reduce the temptation to check your phone constantly.\n\n        4. Use screen time limits: Set limits on how much time you can spend on your phone each day, or on specific apps.\n\n        5. Create a reading routine: Establishing a routine can make",

For some, they might multitask by listening to audiobooks while doing things like commuting, exercising, or doing household chores. And as you pointed out, if they're watching two Netflix episodes a night, they could definitely switch some of that screen time for reading and still have time for a book a week. It's all about prioritizing and finding what works best for your personal schedule. Some people might also read faster than the average reader, too, which would help them get through more books.\n\n        In terms of retaining what I read, I definitely don't retain as much as I'd like to, but I still find value in the books I read. There's a quote I like that goes something like, \"I would rather read a bad book than no book at all.\" So even if I don't",

It's fascinating and incredibly enlightening.\n        2. \"The Man in the High Castle\" by Philip K. Dick - A novel that poses a thought-provoking \"what if\" scenario in which the Axis Powers won World War II, this book is an engaging read that will keep you thinking long after you've finished it.",

There's a reason for some of those book in a year clubs (like Middlemarch in a year). I can read ISOLT years ago! It took me about a year, bit I was interspersing",

While some people immerse themselves in the nuances of character expressions and the vivid landscapes of their minds, you seem to focus more on the plot development and the actions of the characters. Both methods have their own charm, and neither is \"wrong\" or superior to the other. It's a testament to the beauty of reading, that even with such divergent strategies, we can all find enjoyment in the stories we consume. Keep reading, and happy adventures to all! :)\n\n         It's also good to note that some people use a combination of both strategies, depending on the type of book. For example, when diving into character-driven books like literary fiction, readers might spend more time imagining and visualizing scenes. Meanwhile, with works of science fiction, fantasy, or mystery, they may prefer to focus on the plot's structure and the events unfolding",

Make it a priority: Treat reading like a job or a meeting you can't miss.\n        2. Read the right type of books: Opt for shorter books (around 200-400 pages) or choose books within genres you enjoy that are more straightforward.\n        3. Listen to audiobooks: It's easier to multitask and still get through the content.\n        4. Speed read: Skim through parts that aren't as important so you can focus on the central ideas.\n        5. Consistency: Read a little bit every day, even if it's just 30 minutes during your commute. The key is to make it a habit.\n\nI don't retain all I read, but I",

Try using a service like Audible to get started.\n        \n        3) Read only during certain times of the day: Designate certain times during the day for reading, like during your commute, lunch breaks, or before bed. This can help fit reading into an already busy schedule.\n        \n        4) Speed read: Practice reading faster without losing comprehension.

If you really want to read a book a week, then make sure to dedicate at least 1-2 hours a day to reading. Short books can be a good option if time is limited, but it's also important to read longer books to get a more comprehensive understanding of the material. Audio books can be helpful for commuting or when you're doing other activities that don't require your full attention. As for retaining what you read, it's important to actively engage with the text by taking notes, asking questions, and summarizing the main points. Good luck with your reading challenge!",
