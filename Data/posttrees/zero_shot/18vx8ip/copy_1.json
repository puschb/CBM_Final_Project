    "content": "I keep saying stories and posts about challenges like 52 books a year etc, and simply don't understand how people do it. With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

Some people might also be able to retain more of what they read if they take the time to write summaries or discuss books with others. It's also possible that some people are just very dedicated to reading and make it a priority.\n\n        \n        It's also worth considering that some people might not be reading a book a week, but rather reading a few pages each day and completing several books over the course of a year. This would help make it more manageable and sustainable for people with busy schedules.\n\n        \n        Additionally, some people might use book clubs or other reading groups to help keep themselves accountable and motivated to read regularly. This can be a great way to get recommendations for books and to discuss the books with others who share similar interests.\n\n        \n        In short",

As you said, it depends on the book, but I'd still like to share my own approach to reading multiple books in a year. I listen to audiobooks on my daily commute, when I walk the dog, and sometimes when I relax at home. I find that this frees up a lot of time, as I don't have to allot specific periods for reading. I also tend to pick lighter, quicker reads when I'm trying to fit more books into my year. It's a personal preference, and I still take my time with longer, more complex works that I want to truly savor. But I reckon there's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Perhaps it's about finding a balance that works best for us individuals, with our unique routines and preferences. Hope this helps!\n\n         ('Sl",

Just like you, I enjoy the long, space/fantasy operas with lots of characters. Some more focused stories like Altered Carbon are great too, but the longer, grander stories are what I go for when possible. I'm willing to spend the credits on longer books if they're really good. And like you, I find that longer books offer better value for the money since they're usually cheaper than shorter ones. I get two credits a month, so I try to go for long ones to get the most bang for my buck. It all depends on the author and narrator of course!",

Some people are just quick readers, while others prioritize reading as a hobby and make time for it consistently. Listening to audiobooks during commutes, exercising, or even while doing other tasks can help people consume books more quickly, as well. It's also true that some books are shorter, or can be more skimmable than others, which can also contribute to a higher reading",

They might not be as long as some other books, but the quality and pace make up for it. For instance, a typical Audible audiobook of an Agatha Christie novel runs about 4 hours, while a Discworld book might be in the range of 7-9 hours. So it's possible to fit a few in a week if you're efficient with your time and don't necessarily go for the longest books all the time.\n        \n         On the other hand, some people do excel at reading long books quickly, and if that's your goal, you might want to try books with shorter",

Most of the biographies I enjoy (like Obama or Hillary, for instance) are a solid 20 hours. Maybe consider a mix of audio and print? Print for quicker books and audio for the big ones. That's a strategy I've come across in some forum. I don't do it myself, but it seems like a good compromise for getting through a lot of books in a year. \n\n        \ud83e\udd14 Also, have you ever tried speeding up your audio books? It can feel weird at first, but I've been doing that and it saves me a lot of time! \n\n        Just my two cents! \ud83e\udd11\n\n        \ud83d\udcac *[Link to the comment in the thread](https://www.reddit.",

Set a daily reading goal: Aim to read for 30 minutes a day, for instance, and stick to it. Consistency is key.\n\n         2. Block out distractions: Find a quiet, comfortable spot to read and minimize distractions such as noisy surroundings, devices, or people.\n\n         3. Skim through the book: Before diving into the text, skim through the chapters or sections to get a general idea of the content and structure. This will help you focus your attention and move through the book more quickly.\n\n         4. Don't get stuck: If you find yourself struggling with a particularly difficult or complex passage, move on and come back to it later. Keep in mind that you don't need to understand every single detail in",

You might find some short mystery novels, short story collections, or poetry books to be a good read when you're tight on time.\n        - Batch reading: Setting aside specific times in your day or week to focus on reading, and sticking to it, can help create a consistent routine and enable you to get through a book",

Aim for books around the 200-300 page range, as they can be finished in a day or two. It's also helpful to choose books that are engaging and hard to put down, as you're more likely to read them quickly that way.\n\n         Of course, not everyone can do this, and that's okay.

Firstly, the average reading time for a typical novel such as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is between 5-7 hours, not 15-20 hours. Time spent on other activities like surfing the internet or watching tv shows can be substituted for reading.\n        2. The key to reading regularly is efficiently managing your time. For example, if you work 8-9 hours, commute an hour each way, spend four hours a day on household chores, cooking, socializing, and watching tv shows or listening to podcasts, you still have around 5 hours a week for reading. This equates to about 20 hours a month, allowing you to read 10-12 books a year.\n        3. It's vital to have multiple hobbies to avoid becoming overly reliant on one,",

Don't worry though, everyone's reading pace is different, and it's not a competition. Reading should be an enjoyable experience, not a stressful race. As for the retention part, it varies greatly from person to person. Some people can remember a lot, and others not as much.

The act of physically opening a book and turning pages gives a sense of accomplishment that's harder to find with ebooks.\n\nAnother tip is to make reading a part of a daily routine. Just like brushing your teeth or eating breakfast, reading can become a habit if you do it at the same time every day.\n\nHope this helps!",

Could you please give some tips because I really struggle with that aspect\n        \n        I've found creating a set time every day for reading helps tremendously. Set a timer on your phone and intentionally put it down during this time. Find a quiet place to read and eliminate distractions as much as possible. You could also try an app like \"Forest\" that prevents you from accessing other apps while you're reading. If you're using your phone as a book reader, consider setting limits and turning off notifications during your reading time. Good luck with finding a schedule that works for you!",

Find an alternative: If you're using your phone to pass time during commutes or while waiting, consider finding an alternative activity such as listening to an audiobook, working on a crossword puzzle, or even knitting.\n\n        4. Make a personal challenge: Set a",

I usually pick a specific time during the day, like early morning or late evenings, and stick to it. It helps to keep distractions at bay, especially my phone. Sometimes I even put my phone in another room to avoid picking it up. Another tip is to make sure the book you're reading is interesting. If it's something you're really engrossed in, it's easier to resist distractions. I also find that setting reading goals, like 20 pages a day, helps motivate me to pick up the book instead of my phone. Hope this helps! Good luck with your reading goals!",

This gives me a sense of direction and motivation. For instance, aiming to read a chapter a day, or even just 20-30 minutes before bed can add up to a significant amount of reading over time.\n\n        2. Make a reading schedule: Just as you'd schedule appointments or work meetings, dedicate specific time slots to reading. This can help establish a routine and make it less of an afterthought.\n\n        3. Reduce time spent on non-essential activities: As one user pointed out, cutting down",

I would say that making time for reading has definitely improved my life, both mentally and emotionally.\n\n        For the record, I do enjoy reading physical books, but audio books have been a game-changer for me. They allow me to multitask while still engaging with the story, making it easier to fit reading into a busy schedule. I've found that I'm able to retain a fair amount of what I read, but it's not always easy to remember every tiny detail, especially in longer books. However, I find that the main ideas and themes stick with me",

As for the audio books, those can certainly help since you can multitask while listening, but nothing beats a good old-fashioned book.

Here are some strategies that might help you:\n\n        - Prioritize reading time: Carve out specific time each day or week for reading. Treat it like a non-negotiable appointment.\n        - Read shorter books: Opt for shorter novels or non-fiction books with smaller page counts.\n        - Listen to audio books: Listening to audiobooks while commuting or doing household chores can be a great way to turn passive time into reading time.\n        - Read intentionally: Focus on key portions of the book instead of reading every word. This can help save time without sacrificing important information.\n        - Stop multi-tasking: When you read, focus on the book only. Turn off your phone and other distractions to ensure you retain more of what you read.",

If you were to swap that time for reading, you'd be well on your way to achieving that goal. Perhaps it's a matter of prioritizing reading as much as some people prioritize their Netflix habits. As for retaining information, I find that re-reading books or summarizing key points helps me remember the material better. Everyone's approach is different, and finding what works best for you is key.",

It's not always a straightforward swap though - reading requires more focus and sometimes I don't have that kind of mental energy for it. I don't think you can really compare the two. But if you were to switch the time for reading, you might be able to finish 52 books in a year. Some people might even be able to read more than that if they can read more than one book at a time, or if the books they read are shorter.

Reading a book a week sounds like a daunting task, but it's definitely doable if you make it a habit. I've found that setting a daily goal, such as 50 pages a day, and sticking to it really helps. It's amazing how once you start, you get swept away in the story and end up reading more than you intended.\n\n        As for narrators, I have a few that I will listen to anything they read! Audiobooks have been a game-changer for me, especially during long commutes or while doing chores. Some of my favorite narrators include X, Y, and Z. They have such a great way of bringing the story to life.",

Reading speed definitely plays a huge role, and I'm also one of those slow readers. But I think our progress is more subtle and cumulative than we might realize. I've been reading for years, and I can feel myself getting faster, even though it's not always noticeable from one book to the next. New words, complex structures, and new ideas can definitely slow me down, but I think my understanding is improving over time. And yes, I've noticed that too - the more I read, the easier it becomes to understand things that were once mysterious or difficult.

You might consider trying to set aside specific, dedicated reading time each day, or finding a genre or style of book that you really enjoy and find easy to get lost in. Audio books can also be a great way to \"read\" at a faster pace without having to focus on the visual aspect of reading if that's something you find tiring.

I allocate a certain amount of time each day to reading, usually around an hour. When I'm engrossed in the book, I can easily read more than 50 pages within that hour. But if the book isn't captivating, I don't force myself to read past the allocated time. This way, I enjoy my reading time and don't feel stressed about meeting a certain page count. However, it's all about finding what works best for you as a reader. Cheers!",

I personally use this technique to get through books quicker.\n        * Audio books: Listening to books can be a great way to consume books while doing other activities, like working out, driving, or cooking. You can also adjust the listening speed to fit your pace and still retain information.\n        * Focused reading: Dedicating specific time slots for reading can help make it a regular habit. Try finding pockets of free time in your day where you can read, whether it's during your commute, breaks at work, or before bed.\n        * Choose the right books: Reading short books or opting for lighter reads can make your reading goal more achievable.

However, I've come to realize that reading isn't just about the number of books you can consume, but rather the quality of that experience.\n\n         Personally, I've found that taking time to read and absorbing the stories, even for just a few minutes a day, can be immensely rewarding both mentally and emotionally. It's not about finishing a book a week or even a year, but about taking the time to enjoy the journey and the worlds within the pages.\n\n         In terms of time management, I've found that audio books can be a great way to multitask and still enjoy a good story. But that could also depend on personal preference.\n\n         As for retaining information, it varies greatly from person to person. Some people remember vivid details from every book they read, while others retain less.",

I've found that my brain is most active at night and, after a long day, I just want to relax. Reading a book is the perfect way to do that.\n        I read mostly audiobooks at 1.5 to 2x speed, so it takes less time, while still allowing me to retain a good amount of information. I aim for shorter books, but it's not a strict rule.\n        Give it a try and see if it works for you! The key is to find a method that suits your lifestyle and stick with it. Happy Reading!",

It's difficult to fit in longer books when you have other commitments. Reading while eating or winding down, or even when commuting, makes a big difference. It's amazing how those little snippets of time can accumulate over the week. Keep it up! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcd6\ud83d\udcda",

If you can't find short books, you can still break up your daily reading into smaller chunks (up to 30 minutes/day). It's better to be consistent and finish a book rather than rush through a lengthy one and remember nothing.\n\n        2. Select audio books: Listening to books during commutes, exercise, or chores can help you save reading time during the day and increase your overall weekly reading. However, remember that listening to books is different from reading them, and you might miss some details due to distractions.\n\n        3. Prioritize reading: Dedicate a specific time for reading and treat it as a commitment. Reading early in the morning or before bed can be a good starting point. Try to find a time that fits best in your schedule and make it a consistent",
