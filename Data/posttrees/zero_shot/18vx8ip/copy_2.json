    "content": "I keep saying stories and posts about challenges like 52 books a year etc, and simply don't understand how people do it. With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

Read in smaller chunks over time\n        6. Utilize multiple format options (e.g., hardcover, paperback, e-book, audio)\n        7. Dedicate specific periods to reading (e.g., taking the bus, exercising, eating meals)\n        8. Skip portions or skim over less interesting sections\n        9. Lower expectations for retaining every detail\n        10. Make reading goals realistic (e.g., 2 books per month instead of 1 per week)\n        11. Choose books with engaging, easy-to-read writing styles\n        12. Use techniques like \"speed-reading\" with fiction to retain the essence of the story\n        13.

Listening to audiobooks can speed up the process, but it also depends on the complexity of the book. Some books are more straightforward and easier to get through, while others can be challenging even in audio format. As for retaining information, it ultimately comes down to personal learning styles and effort. Some people might remember details and quotes from books for years, while others might struggle to recall basic plot points. It's all about what works best for the individual.",

I've been a platinum Audible subscriber since 2003 too, so I've got a fair amount of experience with listening to books. If a book is less than 10 hours, I might avoid it unless it's from an author I really like or the narrator is exceptional. I think it's important to find a good balance between the book's length, the author's writing style, and the narrator's performance. For me, it's all about finding a book that I'll enjoy listening to and that won't take me too long to complete. Do you ever find yourself wanting to read longer books, but fear that it might be too long? I've found that I'm able to digest longer books better when I listen to them instead of reading them. What do you think?",

I really only listen to Sci-Fi and occasionally fantasy these days with some horror thrown in from King now and then. I used to be more evenly split between the two genres but over the past decade I've mostly stuck to Sci-Fi with a few exceptions like Sanderson. I realized early on the kind of stories I like are the long Space / Fantasy operas with a lot of characters etc. although some more focused stories like Altered Carbon etc. work in too. It's not that I won't go lower than 10 hours, but takes something to make me consider using a credit. Shorter books are also a lot cheaper so sometimes I'll just pony up and buy low hour book if it's cheap enough and something I'm into to save the credit. Length is certainly a part of my equation too - bang",

I agree that length can be a big factor when it comes to cost versus value, but I've found that audiobook bundles can be a great way to get more for your money. For example, if you can find a bundle or sale for a longer series like \"The Expanse\" or \"Ancillary Justice,\" those can be a fantastic investment of time and resources.\n\n         I've also found that breaking up longer books into manageable chunks can make the reading (or rather, listening) feel less daunting. For instance, I started listening to \"The Expanse\" season by season, so it felt more like a TV show I could follow along with over the course of a few weeks. Similarly, I've broken up some heftier titles into smaller chunks, like reading a chapter each night before bed.",

The average novel is typically under 500 pages, so it might be more manageable than one might initially think. Some books are lighter and can be breezed through quickly, while others might take more time, even if they're shorter. It's quite individual, really. As for audio books, they are indeed an option, and many people find them easier to consume due to the quicker pace. As for retaining what you read, that's a personal journey as well. Some people retain more than others, but the important thing is to enjoy the process. Good luck, and happy reading! : )",

It does seem tough to read a book a week even if it's an audio one. But if it's something you really want to do, you could try shortening your listening time by increasing the speed, or focusing your listening sessions to specific times. For example, listening on your commute to work, or while doing household chores. It's all about finding the balance and making time for it.\nUser 1: That\u2019s a pretty good response, though it references the original post asking about reading books instead of focusing on specifically audio books. \n\nYou could revise it with something like:\n\n\u201cYea, I get what you're saying about audio books.

Books that are more accessible and engaging can be polished off relatively quickly, allowing you to tick off those easier books faster.\n\n        2. **Prioritizing**: If a book captures your interest, you'll naturally want to invest more time into it. In my experience, setting aside time specifically for reading can help you push through books more efficiently.\n\n        3. **Utilizing audiobooks**: Audiobooks can be a savior for those who struggle with finding ample free time.

I listen to them during commutes, while doing chores, or even while exercising. It's a great way to get some reading in, without necessarily dedicating a chunk of time to sit down and read.\n\n         As for remembering what I read, it depends on the book.

Romance, mystery, and YA literature, for example, often have a simpler writing style.\n\n         3. Prioritize books for entertainment: If a book's primary purpose is to entertain you, you may be more inclined to speed through it rather than dwell on every sentence and phrase.\n\n         4.

Not all books are created equal in terms of length and complexity. Novellas, shorter novels, and non-fiction books can be read faster. That doesn't mean you should neglect longer books or more complex ones, but saving them for when you have more time can be beneficial.\n        2. Reading methods also play a role. I personally don't recommend listening to audiobooks if you're trying to read a book a week, as you're dependent on someone else's pace and may miss details by not focusing. However, if you do decide to use audiobooks, speed can be adjusted to your liking.\n        3. It's also about making reading a priority and finding time within your daily routine. Even if you only have 30 minutes a day,",

Reading is a personal hobby, and it's wonderful how diverse our reading habits are. I don't think there's any judgment involved in offering advice or tips on how to read more books \u2014 it's all about sharing what works for each of us.\n\n         As for your other points, I've always found book clubs to be a great way to stay motivated and expand my reading horizons. Reading discussions can open your eyes to perspectives you might not have considered otherwise. Another trick I've used is choosing books with shorter chapters or quicker paces to squeeze in a few minutes of reading during the day. And, of course, audiobooks can be a lifesaver when you're juggling multiple commitments!\n\n         Happy reading, and good luck with your goals!",

For example, instead of scrolling through social media, you can listen to audiobooks during your commute or while cooking dinner. It's about prioritizing reading as a valuable activity and making the conscious decision to substitute time spent on less engaging activities with reading time. Even if you can only squeeze in a little reading each day, it gradually adds up over time.

Some like to immerse themselves in a book for hours each day while others, like you, set aside a specific time each night. Both are valid ways to enjoy a book!

Or, you could try breaking up your reading sessions into shorter intervals throughout the day. Just remember, it's essential to prioritize your personal relaxation time, and reading can be a great way to unwind and expand your mind.

I've found that even small pockets of time can add up and allow me to get through a book in a reasonably short amount of time.\n\n        Secondly, I choose books that fit my schedule and interests. For example, I tend to gravitate toward shorter books when I'm particularly busy, and I prioritize those with engaging plots or thought-provoking themes, as I find I retain more of what I read when I truly enjoy it.

Stick to these times and avoid using your phone outside of those designated periods.\n\n        2.

This can be done through your phone's settings or by using digital wellbeing tools available on some devices.\n\n        3. Find alternatives to phone use: Look for activities to do rather than automatically reaching for your phone. This could be reading a book, going for a walk, or practicing a hobby.\n\n        4.

Use an e-reader: If you're reading on a screen, it's easier to control your phone usage since the screen is in one place.\n\n        4. Find a reading buddy: This could be a friend or family member who also wants to read more. You can both hold each other accountable.\n\n        5. Start slow: If you usually read for 30 minutes a day, try increasing that time by 5 minutes every week until you reach your goal.\n\n        6.

Most libraries offer free audiobook platforms like Libby or Hoopla, or there are also paid services like Audible.

Or, for a more old-school approach, it's possible to find books in large print format that are easier to turn the pages with just one hand. Happy reading! :)",

Reading and watching television are completely different experiences, mentally and emotionally. Reading, especially a good book, requires focus and attention that is harder to achieve after a long day of work or family obligations. You have to get into the mindset of the characters, imagine the settings, and create the scene for yourself in your head, which is much more immersive and demands more mental energy than watching a pre-made visual scene. So it's not just about finding the time, it's about making the effort to set aside the time and creating the right environment to fully immerse yourself in the story. The thought that someone would find 52 books a year achievable by just switching to reading from watching Netflix shows a lack of understanding of what reading truly entails.",

One strategy I've found helpful is using a text-to-speech reading app like Speech Central on iOS or LibriVox, which allows you to listen to the book while following along with the text. This can help increase your reading speed and productivity. Additionally, I recommend focusing on shorter books, or books that aren't as heavy on the verbiage and have more concise, straightforward storytelling. Another suggestion is to listen to the audiobook while engaging in activities that don't require much cognitive processing, such as knitting or cooking, so you can split your attention between the book and the activity. You might also find it helpful to set specific reading goals and prioritize making time for reading in your schedule.

Last year, I decided to make a quiet resolution for 2022 to read 50 pages a day for pleasure. I knew that if I set myself a daily time goal, my mind would tend to wander or I'd get distracted. So, I adopted the approach of reading 50 pages a day regularly, and it worked! I ended up getting fully engrossed in something and experiencing that \"vanishing of self\" which was such a relief! If I didn't hit my 50 pages/day goal on some days, it wasn't a big deal. The key, I found, was to pick a goal that feels achievable. Even at 20 pages/day, you will gain momentum. Have a great 2024!",

It's a personal preference, I suppose.\n\n         As for favorite books, there are so many! Some of my all-time favorites include \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee, and \"1984\" by George Orwell. These stories have resonated with me in profound ways and I think they offer valuable insights into life and humanity.\n\n         Another great book I'd recommend is \"The Name Of The Wind\" by Patrick Rothfuss.

It's a stunning and memorable read. If you're looking for something more contemporary, I'd suggest \"Everything I Never Told You\" by Celeste Ng. It's a gripping exploration of family secrets and the consequences of keeping them buried. If you're into science fiction, \"The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet\" by Becky Chambers is a space opera adventure that's surprisingly heartwarming. And of course, for a classic, you can't go wrong with \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee. Those are just a few recommendations, but I hope you find something you enjoy! \ud83d\udcda",

If you keep that pace, it should only be around an hour of focused reading time per day based on a 200-page book. You can easily work that hour into many daily routines, such as during commuting hours, lunch breaks, or even before bed. As for the length of the book, I find that shorter books can be just as fulfilling as longer ones, and in some cases, they can be more engaging because of their fast-paced nature. But if you enjoy epic novels, you can still find time for them, maybe by breaking them into smaller chunks or dedicating a specific day or two per week",

For me, I can generally get through 20-30 pages per 20 minute stretch, but that's just me.

If you can hold yourself to a daily target of 50 pages or so, you could realistically get through a book a week. Audio books are also a great option, though I find I don't retain as much information from them as I do when I read the physical or e-book versions myself. As for the whole \"retaining a lot of what you read\" question, well... I'll let you in on a secret. I don't always remember everything from the books I read, either.

Making it a routine helps me stay focused and motivated, and it helps me get into the story more easily. As for getting bored or tired after reading a certain number of pages, it might be a matter of finding a book that really captures your interest. Sometimes, it takes a few pages to really get into a book, so persisting past those initial pages can pay off. On the other hand, if a book isn't compelling, it might be more difficult to read consistently. Listening to audiobooks can help make it easier to fit reading into your schedule, as well as make it more enjoyable to listen",

It's not always easy, but I find that setting aside small chunks of time throughout the week helps me get through books more quickly. As for retaining the information, it varies from book to book. Some books I remember more than others, but that's just part of the reading experience for me. \n\n        Hope that helps!

Consistently picking up a book each day for half an hour, even just 15 minutes, adds up quickly. Audiobooks are also a great way to multitask and get in some reading hours while doing household chores, commuting, or walking your dog. Reading shorter books can make it easier to manage your reading schedule, while still choosing stories that interest you. Retaining a lot of what you read depends on the book, but generally, books with vivid characters and good storytelling leave lasting impressions. Reading is a personal journey, so if you can find the time and enjoyment in it, it will be easier to develop a regular habit and read more books. Good luck with your reading challenge!",

Find a genre that you love. If you like the content, it will be much easier to read a lot.\n\n        2. Use the reading strategy called skimming to quickly get an overall understanding. Don't worry about absorbing every single detail on the first read.\n\n        3. Read for 30 minutes every single day regardless of whether you're feeling tired or busy. Make it a routine like brushing your teeth.\n\n        4. Don't limit yourself to novels. Nonfiction, academic papers, short stories, and poetry can also count toward your reading goal.\n\n        5.

Reading so slowly can be a struggle sometimes, but there's definitely something comforting about the whole process. Hearing a story in your head like an audio drama can make it feel more immersive, too. Keep on reading at your own pace, my friend! It's all about enjoying the story. \ud83d\ude0a",

I have a Kindle and audiobooks as well, but I've found that the tactile experience of a physical book and the slower pace of reading (versus listening) help me retain more information. I also only read one book at a time and try to pick books that are well-written and engaging. Additionally, I prioritize reading over other leisure activities, like watching TV or browsing social media.\n        It's certainly not easy, but it's entirely possible to read a book a week if you make reading a priority and find ways to incorporate it into your daily routine. Good luck!",

But to each their own, if you find a method that works for you, keep going! If you do choose to split your time like that, maybe consider audiobooks to speed it up a bit during commutes or similar. Good luck with finding your reading rhythm! :-)",

Choose shorter books or series: If you're tight on time, opt for shorter books or a series of books in the same genre.\n        4. Listen to audiobooks: Audiobooks are a great way to \"read\" while doing other things, like driving or exercising.\n        5. Retention isn't necessary: Don't worry too much about retaining every detail of what you read. The main objective is to enjoy the story and broaden your knowledge.\n        6.
