    "content": "I keep saying stories and posts about challenges like 52 books a year etc, and simply don't understand how people do it. With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

            "comment_text": "I've found a few strategies that work for me in regards to reading a book a week. Firstly, I read a variety of genres so I'm not just focusing on one long, dense novel at a time. I mix in shorter books like novellas and poetry collections to break up the long reads. Secondly, I use audiobooks for my commute and any other time I'm doing a task that doesn't require my full attention, like cooking or doing chores. Lastly, I try to read a little bit every day, even if it's just 15-20 minutes, to keep the story fresh in my mind and make it easier to pick up where I left off. Doesn't hurt that many books I love are actually shorter than your average novel!",

It's all about picking the right books, finding ways to squeeze reading time into your daily routine, and setting realistic goals.\n\n        I find that audio books are a great way to multitask and make the most of time that would otherwise be wasted. When commuting to work, doing household chores, or even while exercising, you can learn to appreciate the art of listening and still achieve those reading goals.\n\n        There are many books out there that are not meant to be heavy and time-consuming reads \u2013 they are quick, enjoyable, and can be consumed relatively quickly. Short stories and novellas are perfect examples of this. The key is finding the books that suit your lifestyle and interests.\n\n        As for retaining information, it depends on each individual. Some people find it easier to remember more from books they read,",

If you can find a good series or standalone in the sci-fi genre, it's possible to read several of them within that 10-hour range.

There are definitely some options out there if you focus on the right genre and authors. Happy hunting! \ud83d\ude0a",

The books follow the perspective of a sentient security android known as Murderbot, who hacks its governor module and gains a personality. The series gained a lot of popularity due to its unique blend of humor, action, and social commentary. If you're interested, I'd recommend checking it out!\n\n         I haven't watched the YouTube series you mentioned, so I'm not sure if it's related to the books. The \"Murderbots\" name could be a coincidence since the title is cleverly playful. If watching the videos helps you better understand the books or makes the reading more enjoyable for you, I encourage you to give it a go! Happy reading!  :)",

You're spot on, it's a short series that's mostly novella length, and, yeah, if a single book is less than 10 hours, the author isn't usually a priority for this user. That's not to say they don't enjoy shorter books, but when it comes to longer works of fiction, they seem to prefer audiobooks that maximize their listening time. I imagine they'd be more likely to give the Murderbot diaries a try if they found it bundled together at a lower price, as that would bring the total listening time closer to the 12-14 hour range they seem to prioritize.\n\n        I could be wrong, though. Perhaps they've already given it a shot and didn't love it. Without more context, it's hard to say for sure.",

If the narrator is excellent and the story gripping, I can sometimes push myself to go a little faster. However, I have found that I retain more information if I don't go above 1.5x. Reading the physical book or e-book simultaneously while listening also helps me to stay focused and read more efficiently. Sometimes I even reread parts or skim through portions I've already covered, which allows me to absorb the information more deeply. But at the end of the day, it's all about finding what works best for you! Keep exploring different methods and finding the strategy that helps you achieve your reading goals. \ud83d\ude0a",

But to answer your question more directly, not everyone follows the conventional methods of reading novels. For me, I break it down as follows: I multitask, so I listen to audiobooks during my commute, read during lunch breaks, and grab a few moments here and there. Plus, I enjoy the mix of both - reading and listening. As for retaining information, it depends on the book. For complex classics or intellectual works, I take notes and revisit them. For lighter reads, I just enjoy the story and let the details slip away. It's all about finding what works best for you! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09",

However, I do make a conscious effort to choose shorter books, especially since I want to retain as much of the information as possible.\n\n         I also use speed reading techniques, which can help increase your reading speed by up to 2-3 times. There are various online resources and apps that can help you practice this skill.\n\n         Lastly, it's important to prioritize reading in your daily routine and find pockets of time to dedicate to it. For me, this might be before bed, during lunch breaks, or any other free moments throughout the day. It takes practice and discipline, but it's definitely possible to read a book a week if you're determined to make it a priority.",

That's a valid point, as the length of a book can greatly vary, and the time it takes to read it could be significantly shorter than you initially thought. For instance, consider a book like 'To Kill a Mockingbird', which is approximately 300 pages. Assuming an average reading speed of 200-300 words per minute, a reader could finish this book in about 5-7 hours.\n\n         This might seem like a big chunk of time, but when you consider the amount of time we often spend on non-essential activities like browsing the internet, it's not too far-fetched to find time for reading. Making reading a priority and cutting back on unnecessary screen time can help in achieving your reading goals. After all, books offer us not only entertainment but also a wealth",

I'd say it depends on the person - some people might retain a significant amount of what they read, while others find they remember very little. It's different for everyone.\n        4. Perhaps people ensure they read shorter books, or prioritize speeding through shorter works to make more time for other activities.\n        5.

It's an active process that requires my full attention and engagement, unlike TV or social media that often serve as passive entertainment.

Audio books can also be a great way to fit in more reading time, especially during long commutes or while doing chores around the house. Another tip is to read shorter books or books with smaller page counts to make it seem less daunting and more manageable. Lastly, it's important to remember that retaining a lot of what you read doesn't necessarily mean understanding or remembering every detail; rather, the overall story and themes tend to stay with you the most. So don't stress too much about retaining every piece of information, just enjoy the story and let it resonate with you.",

Replacing phone time with reading can be challenging, especially with all the notifications and apps pulling us in. Here are a few strategies that worked for me:\n\n        1. Set specific times for phone usage: Designate certain hours of the day for checking your phone, and stick to them. This can help create a routine and make it easier to resist the temptation to pick up your phone at other times.\n        2. Use app timers or limitations: Many phones have built-in features for setting time limits on apps, or there are various apps that can help with that. Setting limits on your social media and entertainment apps can free up more time for reading.\n        3. Use a physical book instead of e-books: Physical books can help reduce the temptation to check your phone because they don't have notifications or easy access to other apps.\n        4.

For example, try using your phone less by opening the Kindle app whenever you have free moments instead of social media apps. It's also important to set a consistent reading routine, whether it's a few pages each day or a longer session over the weekend.

Set a daily reading goal: Decide on a realistic amount of pages to read each day and stick to it. Make reading a non-negotiable part of your daily routine.\n\n        2. Turn off notifications: Turn off notifications on your phone for non-essential apps like social media, games, and email. This will help reduce the pull of your phone and the urge to constantly check it.\n\n        3. Use apps to limit screen time: There are various apps available that can help limit your phone usage, such as Forest, Moment, and Space. These apps can help track your phone usage and even reward you for limiting your phone time.\n\n        4. Find a distraction-free environment: Find a quiet, distraction-free environment to read in.

Keep your phone out of sight during those designated reading times. If it's not within reach, it's easier to resist the urge to pick it up.\n\n        4. Use apps that help you manage your phone use, like screen time limiters and focus modes.\n\n        5. And remember, every little bit counts.

Use apps like Forest that turn your phone into a tree and help prevent mindless scrolling.\n\n         3.

Designated Reading Time: Set aside specific time slots for reading, and treat those as non-negotiable appointments. Make it part of your routine and schedule it into your day as you would a work meeting or family time.\n\n2. Digital Detox: Start by taking small steps. For example, try dedicating 15 minutes post-dinner to reading instead of scrolling through social media. Increase the time slots gradually as you get more comfortable.\n\n3. Leverage Apps: I use the Forest app, which locks your phone during a designated time and plants a virtual tree. The more time you spend off your phone, the more the tree grows. The visual reminder can be a motivation boost to stick with it.\n\n4. Put the Phone",

Many people listen to audiobooks while doing other daily activities like commuting, cooking, or cleaning, so that might also be something you could consider if you find it difficult to sit down and focus on a book. From your comment history, it seems that you're not particularly concerned with reading a large number of books quickly but are more interested in enjoying the books you do read. Perhaps prioritizing quality over quantity could be a solution for you. You could try finding shorter books with compelling stories and attractive characters to make them easier to fit into your schedule. As for retaining information, it depends on the person and the book, but I find that re-reading parts or summarizing a book in my own words helps me remember the content better.",

Switching two Netflix episodes a night to reading books does make a significant difference, but it's not just about replacing one form of entertainment with another. It's also about finding efficiencies in your reading habits. Here are a few strategies I've found helpful:\n\n        1. Read books with short chapters - This allows for more flexible reading sessions and it's easier to pick up where you left off.\n\n        2. Read multiple books at once - Sometimes, I have a few books going at the same time. That way, if one becomes boring, I can switch to another one.\n\n        3. Read while traveling or during downtime - Waiting for a bus, train, or appointment can turn into several minutes or even hours of reading time.\n\n        4. Listen to audiobooks - Especially when you're",

If it's something engaging and interesting, those pages can fly by. But if it's a dense, technical book, it might take more time and effort.

I suppose if you were to dedicate the time you'd spend watching TV to reading, you could potentially read a book a week. I'm not much of a TV watcher, so I don't really notice the time going by. But for those who do, it could be a viable option. Maybe some sort of reading challenge could help motivate people too. The 52 books a year thing always seemed unattainable to me, but breaking it down into a weekly challenge could make it seem more manageable.

Another approach I've seen some people take is breaking up their reading sessions throughout the day, like reading a chapter during breakfast, a few pages during their commute, and a couple more pages before bed.

Consider starting with a goal of 50-100 pages per day, and adjust as necessary.\n        2. Find books that hold your interest: If you're not invested in what you're reading, it will be much harder to stick to a regular reading routine. Experiment with different genres and authors to find what you find most compelling.\n        3. Make use of spare moments: Take advantage of opportunities to read when you'd normally be doing something else, such as commuting, waiting in lines, or during lunch breaks.\n        4. Prioritize reading: Make reading a non-negot",

Once you start enjoying the story, you'll likely find yourself reading more than 50 pages a day without much effort. Reading shorter books can also be a good way to cram in extra reading time, but I personally like the immersion of longer novels. I don't think audio books retain as much information as traditional reading, but they can be useful to fit reading into activities that you'd otherwise be doing without a book, like driving or working out.",

Maybe consider audiobooks if you're struggling for time or getting headaches from technobabble word salads like Count Zero. Cheers!",

Increasing your reading speed can help, but it seems that improvement in this area is not guaranteed.

Here are some tips that might help:\n\n        1. Set a daily reading goal: Consistency is key when it comes to reading a book a week. Set a daily goal for the number of pages you want to read each day, and make sure to stick to it. You can adjust the goal based on the length of the book and your reading speed.\n\n        2. Find a quiet place to read: Distractions can make it difficult to focus on reading. Find a quiet place where you can comfortably and distraction-free read your books.\n\n        3. Minimize distractions: This can include turning off your phone, using noise-cancelling headphones, or reading during a dedicated time of day when you know you won't be interrupted.\n\n        4. Read for pleasure: Reading for",

It's crazy to think that some people have to \"hear\" the words in their head before they make sense to them. I on the other hand, can only read books in my head. The words go directly to my brain and I get a picture of the story without any of the steps in between. I find that I get through books incredibly quickly because of this, but I do sometimes think it may be limiting my understanding or connection to the book.

This seems manageable and, as others have noted, once you get into a book, you might find yourself reading more. It's also essential to choose books that engage you, making it easier to stay focused. I've found that taking breaks and revisiting a book after taking a day or two off can help maintain interest. Lastly, audiobooks can be a game-changer for those with busy schedules.

Consistency is key.\n\n3. **Pick shorter books**: Longer books like \"War and Peace\" can take weeks to get through.

If someone enjoys spending all their free time reading, more power to them. Everyone has unique passions and interests, and that's what makes life exciting. I think it's healthy to have hobbies that provide mental stimulation and provide personal fulfillment. Reading is a wonderful way to achieve just that, so I wouldn't call it a bad hobby. But of course, it's all about balance and finding what works best for each individual. Cheers to happy reading days! \ud83d\udcda\u2728\ud83c\udf20",

To achieve this, I generally read for a minimum of 30 minutes each day and make it a part of my daily routine. I also prioritize what I read based on my interests and available time. I mostly read physical books, but I mix in audio books for longer books or when I'm traveling. It's worth noting that reading for leisure and entertainment, I don't retain all the details, but I absorb the main ideas and enjoy the overall story.\n\n        2. Replying to the comment of interest:\n            I'm glad I'm not the only one who has this experience! I, too, find myself saying the words in my head while reading, which significantly slows down my reading speed. After learning this from my husband, I've been practicing to read without subvocalizing,",

Books like \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman and \"The Rosie Project\" by Graeme Simsion are great examples of well-written, thought-provoking books that don't take forever to consume. On the other hand, there's no shame in reading long books, just allow yourself more time to digest them.\n        2. Listen to audiobooks: Audiobooks can be a game-changer when it comes to reading more. Combine your daily commute, gym visits, or even chores around the house with the pleasure of engaging your mind in a new story. Audiobooks allow you to double or even triple the number of books you can get through in a year.\n        3. Make it a priority: Like everything else in life, reading is a habit.",

I read when I'm eating breakfast, lunch, and sometimes even during downtime at work. I also tend to choose books that are around 300 pages. Longer books can be a challenge to fit into the schedule. It's also a bonus if you can enjoy an audio book while doing other tasks. And yes, I think I retain a lot of what I read, but it's definitely not all. Some books just stick with you, while others are more of a 'fluff' read that's just nice to escape into for a while. \\*wink\\* Maybe setting a goal to read a certain number of pages per day could help.

I don't have a specific method for choosing shorter books, but I do try to read faster as I've gotten more experienced. That said, I've read some massive books and still managed to complete them.

Treat it like a scheduled appointment, and try to set aside dedicated time each day or week. You mentioned work, families, and other commitments - it's indeed challenging, but finding balance can make a significant difference. You might find that audio books allow for multitasking and speed up the process.\n\n        Regarding retaining information, it's different for everyone. Some people remember more from physical reading, others from listening. It might be helpful to take notes as you read, or re-read sections a few times. But in the end, it's essential to remember that the primary goal is to enjoy the story and broaden your horizons. Don't get overwhelmed by trying to retain too much information - instead, appreciate the experience and let it inspire you",
