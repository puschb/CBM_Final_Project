    "content": "I keep saying stories and posts about challenges like 52 books a year etc, and simply don't understand how people do it. With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

I always try to set aside some time for reading, like during meals, wait times, or even while taking a bath. I also listen to audiobooks during my long commute to work. As for retaining a lot of what I read, I try to keep a journal of what I've read and my thoughts on it. This helps me remember key points and enjoy revisiting the book as well. Lastly, I mostly read longer books because I find them more immersive and rewarding. Hope that helps!",

They might be interested in knowing that the average novel is around 8 hours in audio and most people read faster than that. Additionally, the user values audio books and mentions they listen to them while driving and going to bed. They might be interested in finding quicker novels to listen to, as they seem to value their time and efficiency in getting through books.",

Jeez, that's some serious dedication. I guess once you get hooked into the rhythm of a good audiobook, it's hard to stop. It's like a drug, really.\n\n        But hey, to each their own. Some people like to take it slow, I guess. But if a book is less than 10 hours, I would generally avoid it unless it's by an author or a narrator I really love. Because let's be real, life's too short to waste it on mediocrity, right?\n\n        And don't even get me started on 'fast readers'. Amateur stuff, they are.

If you are looking to read more and find time, perhaps you can try integrating reading into your daily commute or multitasking it with other activities like listening while exercising or walking the dog.

If you ever want to switch things up and see if you like physical reading more, I'd recommend giving it a shot. Different formats can work for different books and people.

Plus, I find children's books often have a freshness and simplicity that make them really enjoyable and easy to digest! It's all about finding your reading rhythm \ud83d\ude42",

I think the real secret to reading quickly is practice and focus. The more you read, the faster you'll get, and the more focused you are on the text, the less time you'll spend processing it. Audio books can also help, as they allow you to multitask while still absorbing the text. But ultimately, it's about finding what works best for you and sticking with it.",

I think a large part of it comes down to understanding the material and absorbing the information, which is easier when you genuinely enjoy the book. That's why I personally tend to prioritize non-fiction titles over novels. I also find that note-taking, as I mentioned earlier, aids in both my understanding and retention of the material. So while shorter books certainly are quicker to get through, I think that's more a consequence of the material and the structure of the book rather than a deliberate strategy to increase reading speed.",

Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n         1. Prioritize what you want to read: If you're only reading for the sake of meeting a certain number, it's going to feel like a chore. Find books that genuinely interest you and make time for them.\n         2. Pick shorter books: Some novels are more than 1,000 pages long, and those can take a significant amount of time. Look for books under 300-400 pages, and read books in a genre you enjoy.\n         3. Set daily reading goals: Set aside 20-30 minutes a day to read, and try to stick to it. You can increase the time as you get more comfortable and experienced.\n         4. Read before bed: Make reading before bed a habit",

I always assumed that because I'm a slow reader, a 300-page book would take me a long time. I should definitely consider how much time I waste online and see if I can find more time to read. Thanks for the insight, stranger!\nUser 46: The average book does not take 15-20 hours to read. Let\u2019s say To Kill a Mockingbird. It\u2019s about 300 pages. That\u2019s between 5-7 hours for a normal reader. Think about how much time you waste online. Your phone screen time could easily be substituted for reading. Once you do that, you can read a book in a day or two. It\u2019s just about making time and how important you regard",

I've been trying but the language and agendas of the writing have variably changed and I can't quite get used to it. Some people just have more time than others, and that's okay. I understand you don't have a lot of spare time for reading, but reading books is such a rewarding activity that I believe everyone should make time for it, even if you have to sacrifice other hobbies or activities to do so. It helps you learn, grow, and gain new perspectives on the world. If you don't have time for reading, then you should consider if there are other things that can be sacrificed to make reading a priority.",

They can be great for multitasking, such as when commuting or doing chores around the house.\n\n        If you find it difficult to concentrate on a book for extended periods, try breaking it up into smaller sessions.

In response to the original post, here are some suggestions:\n\n         - Listen to audiobooks on your commute or during household chores. This way, you can \"read\" during times when you'd normally be doing something else.\n\n         - Set aside dedicated reading time each day, even if it's just 10-15 minutes. This ensures that you're consistently making progress in your books.\n\n         - Choose shorter books or books with smaller chapter sizes. This helps make reading feel less overwhelming",

It's good to have your own opinion, but if someone has a different view point or perspective, understand that they may have their reasons for it. Don't get too caught up in defending your beliefs that you forget to learn from others.\n\n        In this specific scenario, it's just a discussion about reading habits, so there's no need to get defensive or agitated about it. There are countless ways to approach reading, and if one method works for someone, that's okay. Let people figure out what works best for them, instead of judging or trying to change them.\n\n        I'd also say that there's more value in having meaningful, constructive discussions like this, that can challenge our perspectives, than tearing people down for having differing opinions.

Set specific reading goals: Having a clear goal in mind, such as a certain number of pages or books per week/month, can help motivate you to read consistently and reduce the temptation to spend time on your phone.\n\n         2. Use a screen time or productivity app: These apps can help you track your phone usage and set limits on certain apps or categories (like social media). They can also provide reminders to put your phone away and pick up a book instead.\n\n         3. Find a reading buddy: Having someone to discuss books with can help motivate you to read regularly and make it a more enjoyable experience. You could even schedule regular \"reading dates\" together.\n\n         4. Create a dedicated reading space: Having a space specifically for reading can help create a mental association with reading and make it",

This could be when you're on your commute, during lunch break, or just before bed.\n\n         3. Turn off notifications: Limit interruptions from your phone during your reading time by turning off notifications.

Set up app filters or restrict phone usage during specific times of the day, such as while reading or during designated wind-down periods.\n        4. Find an accountability partner or join a book club to keep motivated and feel more inclined to make reading a priority.\n        5. Try adjusting the screen tone of your phone to make it less appealing while reading, or use a blue-light filter if that helps.\n\nGood luck with finding a balance and embracing your reading journey",

Is it mostly audio books?\n\nI personally find reading physical books or ebooks a more immersive experience, but I do have a few audio books in my back catalog. They're great for long commutes or exercise.\n\n3. Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?\n\nI don't know if I retain a lot, but I certainly remember some novels vividly. The scene with the three children from Jude the Obscure has stayed with me for years. That shows me I retain some important pieces!\n\n4. The phone has no pull over me.\n\nExactly!

Set a daily reading goal: Set aside a specific amount of time each day to read, such as 30 minutes or an hour. This can help create a routine and make it easier to stick to.\n\n         2. Turn off notifications: Turn off notifications from social media, emails, and other apps that tend to be time-wasting. This can help reduce the desire to constantly check your phone.\n\n         3. Use a phone app to track your progress: There are apps that can help you keep track of the books you've read and the amount of time you spend reading. This can provide motivation to continue and help you stay accountable.\n\n         4. Use a physical book: Some people find that physical books are easier to put down and pick up again than e-books or audio books. You might also find it easier to avoid picking up your",

Some people I know do all of this. It's really about finding your own rhythm and adjusting your schedule accordingly.\n\n        As for the pages turning, I've been listening to audiobooks lately.

So, while it's theoretically possible to switch out two Netflix episodes per night for a book, the quality of your reading experience and your ability to retain information from the book might suffer. Personally, I find it more effective to set aside a dedicated block of time each day for reading, rather than fitting it in here and there. But everyone's situation is different, and what works for one person might not work for another.\n\n         As for audio books, they can be a great way to fit more reading into your day. You can listen while commuting, doing chores, or exercising. However, many people find that they don't retain as much information from audiobooks as they do from reading physically or digit",

I'm also not the best at retaining everything, but then again I don't think anyone is. For me, I manage to get through a book a week by prioritizing reading, even if it's just a little bit each day. I also choose books that are shorter or less dense in terms of plot or prose, though I do enjoy a good novel every now and then. Audiobooks definitely help, especially on long commutes or while doing chores. And yes, I do find myself trying to taste the food sometimes or visualize the scenery.

One strategy is to focus on shorter books.

Some people might find his protagonists' flaws and traumatic experiences a bit too much, but others find it adds depth to the story.\n\n         As for",

Some people might speed read, but it's definitely not for everyone, especially if the material is dense or complex. In that case, you might want to try audiobooks if available, as they can help get through books faster, especially when paired with multitasking like cooking, driving, or exercising. Additionally, making time for even a small amount of reading every day, like 30 minutes a day, can add up and help you get through more books over the course of a year. Good luck and keep reading!  :)",

Reading a book's genre makes a world of difference - I zipped through a 500-page romance novel in a day, but 350-page literary fiction can take me 2-3 days. To achieve reading a book a week, I try to start with a lighter read or audio book for the first few days, then move on to heavier, more engaging novels. If it's a book I'm really into, I can easily double or triple my reading speed. Another tip: I try to read for at least an hour every day, even if it's just a few pages, and I find I retain a lot more information that way. If I'm not sure about a book, I'll listen to the first few chapters to see if I enjoy the plot and characters, then I'll switch to reading if I think I'll like it. Do you have any other tips for me",

One thing to consider is that people have different reading speeds.

Sometimes it's just a few pages here and there, but I find that, with practice, you can get into the flow of the story even with short reading sessions.

If you want a tl;dr - an author of an upcoming historical novel (\"The Storm We Made\") discusses how many authors of historical fiction do a gargantuan amount of research, including visiting the places involved. The author did not do that, and suggests that since history is ultimately just memories passed down from person to person, why can't historical novels basically be the same? A story in a historical setting that doesn't involve having 100 pounds of research papers and a month-long hike to get all those details that nobody cares about correct. Okay",

My wife bought me an Audible subscription for Christmas one year, but I just can't seem to get into them. Every now and then, I'll give it a try, but it's just not the same experience for me as reading the actual book. Plus, there's something sort of sad and lonely about walking around with earbuds in while everyone else is engaged in their own thoughts or conversations.

For me, it's a way to disconnect from everyday life and just relax. Reading speed and abilities are unique to each person, and setting unrealistic reading goals can make it a chore rather than a pleasure. I'd rather read a few good books slowly and truly appreciate them than rush through a bunch and not remember much of what I've read. If anyone else enjoys the challenge, that's great, but it's not for me. I want to get the most out of my reading experience, and that means taking my time and not worrying about numbers.",

Focus on books that are 200-300 pages long, as they can be read within 15-20 hours, considering a pace of 4-5 hours a week.\n        2. Many people do incorporate audiobooks into their reading routine, especially for longer books. This way, they can \"read\" while commuting, cooking, or even exercising.\n        3. Retaining information depends on the individual and the methods used to absorb the content. Some popular techniques include summarizing the book to a friend, writing notes, or simply staying engaged with the material.\n        4. Lastly, remember that quality learning is essential. Don't rush through books just to meet certain goals. Read for enjoyment and personal growth, rather than the sheer number of books you have read. Hope that helps!",
