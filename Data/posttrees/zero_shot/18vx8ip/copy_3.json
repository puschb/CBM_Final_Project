With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

I set aside a specific slot in my daily routine for reading, and I make it a non-negotiable activity. I don't necessarily aim to read a book a week, but I try to keep a steady pace. To maximize my reading speed, I also make a habit of skimming through the text, focusing on the main points, and occasionally revisiting the harder sections if needed. As for retention, it varies from book to book, but I find that I generally remember the overall plot and key themes for most books I've read.\n\n        \n\n        On the subject of audio books, I haven't personally delved into them too much, but from what I've heard, they can be a good way to fit reading into a busy schedule. However, I personally prefer the immersive experience of reading",

I like Pacey, but don't really listen to the the kinds of things he narrates I would prefer Simon Jones, and Kate Reading and Michael Kramer very often come as a pair. While they do do independent works I mostly know them for their team ups on Wheel of Time, Codex Alera, and Stormlight Archives. I met them at the APAC (Narrators convention) back in... 2016/17? Very nice folks. The were hanging around with Scott Brick who was like a Rock Star there at the time, literally had an entourage. There we on a couple of panels as well if memory serves. If we're talking English narrators my favorite is hands down John Lee.",

I mean, I'm a platinum audible subscriber since 2003 and I avoid books that are less than 10 hours unless they're by an author or a narrator I really like.\n\n        2. For me, it's mostly audio books. I find it easier to multitask that way, like doing chores or working out while listening to a book.\n\n        3. Yeah, I guess I do retain a decent amount of what I read. I'm pretty good at picking up key details and understanding the overall storyline. But I don't know if I'd say I remember every little thing.\n\n        4. As for the time, well, I've learned to just squeeze it in wherever I can.

For instance, \"And Then There Were None\" is around 6 hours, and \"Murder on the Orient Express\" is around 7 hours. As for the Discworld books, most of them are quite short as well, with the average length being around 8 or so hours. But if you're looking for a series within the Discworld universe, the Tiffany Aching books can be a bit longer due to the amount of detail Terry Pratchett includes, but they're still typically under 10 hours.\n\n        In any case, it's all about finding books that you enjoy and can immerse yourself in, regardless of length. Reading (or listening) for pleasure rather than trying to meet some arbitrary goal is the key to truly enjoying the experience. And if you find a great narrator, it can",

For example, \"The Expanse\" series by James S.A. Corey is a popular sci-fi series that is over 10 hours each, and could be a good pick. If the user is looking for shorter books to save credits, they might recommend a shorter sci-fi novel like \"The Martian\" by Andy Weir.

I also make sure to read a bit when I'm at home, whether it's the physical book, or a digital version on my phone or kindle.\n\n        Last weekend I read Lonesome Dove (which is over 900 pages) in two and a half days using this method.

Perhaps the real secret lies in finding a balance between your commitments and your reading time, and making reading a priority in your life.

Over time, you'll find that those short chunks of time add up and you'll be surprised at how quickly you can get through books. Additionally, engaging with the material, whether through critical thinking about what you're reading or taking notes, can help you retain more of what you read.

I could never get through adult literature, but I've found a few gems in children's books. I loved The Goblin Emperor, it was so well-written and the narrator did a great job. I like alternating between listening and reading so I can get pronunciations right and still keep up with the text. I'm happy to find people who also think there's more to children's literature!",

But I find the key is not to force yourself to remember every detail, but to grasp the main themes and messages. Also, writing down thoughts and observations in a journal or notes can help solidify your understanding of the book.\n\n        One strategy I've found helpful is scheduling specific time slots for reading and sticking to it.

Personally, I find that if I prioritize reading, I can easily make time for it. And the notion that one needs to read a short book or listen to an audio book to manage it isn't necessarily true, either. I mean, classics like To Kill a Mockingbird are quick reads, but they're also some of the most impactful books I've ever read. I think it's crucial to consider just how much time we waste online and to redirect that energy towards reading if we want to make it a priority.

Others find that they retain more from the material when they take the time to read slowly and thoughtfully.

Books with larger vocabularies or complex themes can take longer to read, so starting with something more straightforward might be beneficial.\n\n        2. Use audiobooks: Audiobooks can be a great way to fit reading into your busy schedule. You can listen to them while commuting, cooking, or doing chores. It essentially turns those tasks into productive activities!\n\n        3. Set realistic goals: Instead of aiming to read a book each week, try setting smaller goals like reading for 30 minutes each day. This way, you'll steadily make progress without feeling overwhelmed.",

I think people make the time because reading books can be a genuine source of learning and self-improvement. For me, I use a combination of audiobooks and actual reading, and I try to fit it into my daily routine. I listen while cooking, commuting, or even doing mundane tasks around the house. Reading before bed helps me wind down and can help with insomnia. I also set a goal to read a certain number of pages per day or per week, and I make it a priority.

It's all about making reading a priority and valuing your time. Of course, it's understandable that not everyone can devote 8+ hours a day to reading, as there are other commitments and responsibilities in life.

Assuming 5 days a week with an average of 20 minutes per day (for weekdays, if you're tired, you might read less than that, but on weekends, you probably have enough energy to read more), that sums to 100 minutes per week. Over the course of a month, that's almost 10 hours of reading time. Over the course of the year, that's close to 500 hours. That's not an impossible amount of time, considering that time includes the 5 days a week that you set aside for work.",

Especially when considering the factors you mentioned like work and family commitments. I used to have the same struggle. However, I found a few strategies that might help.\n\n         Firstly, audiobooks. They're a game-changer. You can listen to them while commuting, cooking, or even washing dishes. It fits well into your daily life, and some people even find they retain information better from audiobooks.\n\n         Secondly, consider multitasking. Not everybody reads well while doing other things, but if you can, you could read a book while cleaning, exercising, or doing other tasks that don't require intense mental focus.\n\n         Lastly, try to read a little bit every day.

It's all about making a conscious effort to find time for reading amidst other commitments and prioritizing what matters most to us as individuals.\n\n        For those who are avid readers, it's possible to make reading a part of your daily routine, such as reading during lunch breaks or before going to sleep. To complete 10-12 books a year, it appears you must find a balance between dedicating quality time for reading and ensuring other aspects of your life remain healthy, like nurturing relationships and self-care.

This allows me to read something engaging and quick when I don't have as much time, and invest longer periods into a more complex, time-consuming book when I have more time. For example, I might be reading a longer, more complex book like \"War and Peace\" on my kindle, something lighter like a mystery novel on audiobook, and a graphic novel on my phone if I'm waiting in line somewhere.

Set boundaries: Assign specific times of the day for using your phone, and stick to that schedule.\n\n        3. Make it less convenient: Move your phone to a less accessible location, like another room, to make it harder to pick it up and use it.\n\n        4. Find alternative habits: If you usually reach for your phone when you're bored, try finding other activities to do during those moments, such as reading, writing, drawing, or practicing an instrument.\n\n        5.

Set specific times to check your phone, and stick to them. For example, I set aside half an hour each morning and evening for checking messages and social media.\n        2. Turn off notifications for non-essential apps. This can help reduce the temptation to constantly check your phone.\n        3. Find a hobby that you enjoy but that doesn't involve a screen. Reading books can be a great replacement for screen time, but there are lots of other activities that can help too, like journaling, painting, or playing a musical instrument.\n        4. Try using a digital detox app, like Offtime, to help you limit your use of certain apps.\n        5. Find accountability partners. Having someone to help keep you on track can be really helpful.\n\nGood luck with finding more time for reading! It",

As for the book length, I mostly read e-books because the size doesn't matter, and I tend to stick with books that are under 1000 pages, if not shorter. I don't think you have to sacrifice a lot of what you read if you make a conscious effort to read more.\n\n         P.S.

Here are some tips to help you reduce your screen time and replace it with reading:\n\n         1. Turn off push notifications for social media apps and limit your time on these platforms. You can use apps like Freedom or Cold Turkey to block distractions and stay focused on your reading.\n\n         2. Keep your phone in a different room while you're reading. If you're worried about missing calls or messages, set aside specific times during the day to check your phone.\n\n         3. Try to read for at least 30 minutes every day. This could be during your commuting time, lunch breaks, or before going to bed. Consistency is key when it comes to building a reading habit.\n\n         4. Choose shorter books or shorter chapters in longer books to make your reading session more manageable.",

Make reading a daily habit. Just like brushing your teeth or exercising, reading should be something you do every day.

As for tips, here are a few that have worked for me:\n\n        1. Set specific day and time to read: I find it easier to stick to my reading schedule if I make it a part of my daily routine. For example, I try to read for an hour after dinner every day.\n\n        2. Turn off push notifications: I turned off all non-essential push notifications on my phone. That way, I'm not constantly interrupted and can focus on reading.\n\n        3. Use an app to track reading progress: I use an app called Goodreads to track the books I've read and the books I'm currently reading. This helps me stay motivated and see my progress.\n\n        4.

Switching that leisure time for reading indeed seems reasonable. Boom, 52 books in a year! However, I would argue that reading offers a more enriching and lasting impact compared to watching Netflix. But then, that's just my opinion. For me, it's not about quantity, but quality of reading material. I prefer to savor a good book, digest it slowly, and retain as much as I can. Short books can be satisfying too, but they don't always offer the depth that longer books can. As for the time commitment, I do listen to audiobooks during my commute or while doing chores to squeeze in some reading time. It helps, but I still find plenty of time to watch Netflix, so I'm guessing it's not a big problem for others either.",

Guess I'll have to get back to you on how to read a book a week in that case \ud83d\ude02\n\n         Still, there are other alternatives to regular books. Audiobooks are a great option when your hands are tied up, if you don't mind listening to someone else read to you. It's also a good way to catch up on some reading during lengthy commutes or while doing chores.\n\n         And hey, there's nothing wrong with skipping around in a book if you find it's not hooking you. It's better to DNF (Did Not Finish) a book and move on to something more enjoyable than to labor through a mediocre read just for the sake of meeting a self-imposed goal.\n\n         Ultimately, reading is a wonderful hobby.

For me, it's often swapping out some Netflix time or using my commute efficiently. As for retaining information, that varies greatly depending on the book and individual reader. Some books stick with me for years, while others I can't remember much beyond the plot. I tend to read in multiple sittings over several days or weeks, depending on the book's complexity.

Reading and watching TV are two completely different mediums and require different amounts of engagement and mental processing. A novel requires active reading, which involves visualizing scenes, understanding complex concepts, and empathizing with characters. Watching an episode of a TV show is more passive and can be easily done while multi-tasking or even as background noise. Reading a book takes more time and mental energy compared to watching TV. So, it's not as simple as just exchanging TV time for reading time to read a book a week. People who read a lot probably make a conscious effort to prioritize reading and set aside dedicated time for it, unlike TV which is often consumed in small bits during free time.",

Treat reading as a top priority: Just like watching Netflix, set aside a specific time each day or week for reading. Make it a non-negotiable part of your routine.\n\n         2. Choose shorter books: If time is limited, pick shorter novels or non-fiction books with smaller page counts.\n\n         3. Listen to audiobooks: Audiobooks are a great way to \"read\" while multitasking, such as commuting, doing chores, or exercising.\n\n         4. Stop rereading sentences or paragraphs: If you find yourself revisiting the same parts of a book, try to absorb the information the first time you read it. This will save you time and increase your reading speed.\n\n         5. Use e-readers: E-readers make it",

I've cut back on my screen time considerably, and made room for reading in the evenings. It's not a constant read, but if I watch an hour or two of TV in the evening, I can usually read for an hour as well. The key for me is that I enjoy reading, so it feels like a treat rather than a chore. It's easier to find the time for something you enjoy. Plus, I often read books via audiobook while I'm commuting to work or doing housework - so it's not like I'm taking time out of my day to read. It's just a matter of reprioritizing how I spend my time.",

The text being right before my eyes makes it much easier for my mind to absorb and remember what I'm hearing.

If you find 50 pages a day challenging, I would suggest starting with a smaller goal like 20 pages a day and gradually increasing it. Whatever your goal, consistency is key. Happy reading!",

The epic tale of an apocalyptic struggle between good and evil is a must-read.\n\n        2. \"All the Light We Cannot See\" by Anthony Doerr - This book tells the story of two young people whose lives are intertwined during WWII. It's beautifully written and captures the heartbreak, fear, and hope of that time period.\n\n        3. \"The Overstory\" by",

The trick is to treat it as a regular part of your day, like washing the dishes or taking the dog for a walk. I find that if I make it a habit, it's easier to stick to it.

If you're reading around 10 pages in 10-20 minutes, you could aim to dedicate 1.5-3 hours per day to reading. That's already a significant chunk of time, but it's not impossible to find. You could try incorporating reading into your daily commute, during lunch breaks, or before going to bed. As for the books, if you prefer longer or more complex novels, that's fine! You might just need to adjust your reading schedule accordingly. And yes, many people find that they retain less of what they read when they read quickly.

From my comment history it seems I tend to enjoy romance novels a bit more and find them easier to read through. It doesn't mean that literary fiction is somehow less worthy, just that some books require extra attention to really grasp the themes and nuances. That's why I think it's interesting to diversify",

It's also worth considering whether comprehension is more important to you than the sheer number of books you read.\n\n        As someone with a literature degree and a history of being an English teacher, I'd like to share a few strategies that may help you improve your reading speed without sacrificing comprehension:\n\n        1. **Skimming**: This is a technique where you quickly scan the headings, bullet points, and key phrases to get a sense of the main points. It can save time without losing important information.\n\n        2. **Chunk reading**: Instead of focusing solely on individual words or sentences, try to read and comprehend large chunks of text",

It's important to balance reading with other activities that contribute to overall health, like physical exercise, socializing with others, and engaging in creative or intellectual pursuits beyond books.\n        \n         It's also worth noting that different people have different needs and it's important to find a balance that works for each individual.

A 10-hour book might be overwhelming, but a 4-hour book could be manageable.\n\n        - Read faster: Improve your reading speed to finish books more quickly. there are different techniques and exercises to help you do this.\n\n        - Audio books and e-books: Audio books and e-books can help you fit in reading time during commutes, walks, or other downtime.\n\n        - Read widely: Don't limit yourself to novels.

Some people can read incredibly fast, while others, like you and me, take a bit more time. It's not uncommon for people to subvocalize while reading, creating an inner narrative that slows down the reading process.\n\n         If you're looking to increase your reading speed, there are techniques that might help. For example, practicing skimming and scanning text quickly, reading ahead a sentence or two before fully digesting the previous one, or even using audio books to enhance your reading speed by training your ear to pick up more words per minute. Ultimately, it's essential to find a method that works for you and fits with your lifestyle and preferences.\n\n         And hey, there's absolutely no shame in taking your time with a book! Reading is a personal experience, and it's crucial to enjoy the process and absorb the information or story in the way that suits you",

You can retain a lot of information by listening to well-narrated books, though do take notes if possible.\n\n        5. Read shorter books or skip long descriptions and focus on plot and dialogue.
