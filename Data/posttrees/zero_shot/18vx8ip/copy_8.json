    "content": "I keep saying stories and posts about challenges like 52 books a year etc, and simply don't understand how people do it. With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

            "comment_text": "I usually find the time to read a book a week by dedicating specific blocks of time each day to reading. I'll often set aside an hour before bed or during my morning commute. I also make sure to read a variety of book lengths, from shorter novellas to longer novels, depending on my schedule in a given week. And yes, I often do listen to audio books for less time-intensive reads or when I'm doing something else like driving or cooking.\n\n        As for retaining information, it varies depending on the book. With fiction, I enjoy the story more if I don't obsess too much over every detail. With non-fiction, I tend to take notes and revisit key points.\n\n        I've found that audiobooks, especially when read by the author themselves, can be a great way to get through more books. They're especially helpful when you're performing repet",

I know some folks that can power through books quickly, but even with a good narrator, I find myself going over details in my mind and rewinding a chapter or so just to make sure I understand something. I mean, I'd like to be faster, but I think reading the book a second time to better absorb the information could be beneficial, especially with longer more complex works.

I've been an Audible platinum subscriber since 2003 and I've found that I generally avoid books that are less than 10 hours unless it's by an author or narrator I really like. I often prefer to listen to audiobooks while driving or doing chores around the house. It's a great way to multitask and make the most of my time. And as for retaining what I read, I find that listening to audiobooks forces me to pay more attention and really engage with the story, which ultimately enhances my understanding and recall of the material.

Shorter books are cheaper so I might buy those instead if they're something I'm interested in. I get two credits a month, so I like to go for long books to get the best value.

However, it's important to remember that everyone has different reading speeds and preferences. For me, some genres are easier to read through and understand quickly, like romance and mystery novels. But classics or noteworthy books may take longer because their writing can be more complex and requires more time to process. At the end of the day, it's not a competition, read what you like and enjoy the process, as you said. Happy reading!",

To read a book a week, you could focus on shorter books, which might run around 150-250 pages. This would cut down on your reading time considerably.\n\n    b. Prioritize reading time: Make reading a priority. You could wake up an hour earlier, or go to bed an hour later, to fit in some extra reading time. You could also bring a book with you on public transportation or during lunch breaks.\n\n    c. Use audio books: Audio books can be a great way to squeeze in some extra reading time. You can listen to books while driving, exercising, cooking, or any time you have a free moment but can't read a physical or e-book.",

For example, set a limit for browsing social media, like 30 minutes a day, and stick to it.\n        2. Turn off notifications for apps that aren't essential. This will reduce the number of interruptions you receive throughout the day and help you stay focused on your reading.\n        3. Designate specific times during the day for phone usage. For example, you could allow yourself to check your phone during lunch breaks or in the evenings, but avoid using it during times when you should be reading.\n        4. Find alternative activities to distract yourself when you feel the urge to pick up your phone. This could be taking a walk, reading",

Consistency is key; establishing a routine helps you carve out regular slots for reading.\n\n         As for retaining what you read, my approach is to take notes as I go and then revisit them periodically.

You can use an e-reader device like a Kindle, or you can download e-book apps on your phone or tablet.\n\n3.

As for retaining information, I think it depends on the book and the reader. Some books stick with you easier than others, but it's always useful to have discussions or reread parts of the book to remind yourself of what you've learned.

Watching TV shows offers a more passive form of entertainment, and while it can certainly be engaging, it's a very different experience from actively reading and engaging with a book. I don't watch Netflix as a way to escape or relax in the same way I do when I'm reading. It might be possible to swap watching time for reading time, but it's not about finding the time so much as it is about prioritizing what you want to do with your time. As for the time it takes to read a book, I think people who read a lot often have a keen interest in the subject matter, which makes it easier to get through. If you're reading something that piques your curiosity or fascinates you, you're going to be more likely to make time for it. It's not just about finding the time, it's",

It's not necessarily that we find extra time for reading; it's more about prioritizing our leisure activities. For me, 52 books a year is achievable if I deliberately choose to invest that \"Netflix time\" in books instead. I still enjoy my series, but I find reading more rewarding, personally. As for the length, I often choose shorter books or books with smaller chapter lengths to maintain the momentum and not feel overwhelmed. And while I might not remember the tiny details, the key themes and messages usually stick with me.

And to your point about the average book taking 15-20 hours, I agree that it varies a lot depending on the book. Some books can be devoured in just a few hours, while larger books can take longer. I do listen to audiobooks frequently, but I still like to have a physical book to read as well. Maybe try setting aside a specific time each day for reading, and see if that helps increase your reading speed and enjoyment!\n        \n         Some other things that might help:\n         - Try focusing on shorter books initially to build up",

Yes, it's a long book, but I found myself eagerly heading back to the pages each day, just to see what new revelations and connections the next chapters would bring. It's not a book you can rush through; it requires time and patience, but the payoff is worth it.

I need to be curled up when I read though. With work, families, and commitments, I make sure I read for at least an hour in bed before sleep. Sometimes two, depending on the book. On weekends, I spend a few hours each day on the couch reading. And then, there's holidays and commutes. I'm also, probably, what is considered a fast reader. I do also watch lots of Netflix; exercise; have a job, and a family. I've been reading like this all my life so I guess I am used to it. Plus, walking while reading helps me lose a bit of weight.",

If it makes you happy, then it's a great hobby indeed. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc95\n\n         Additionally, reading can also be a form of escape, a way to travel to different places and times, to gain new perspectives, and to connect with characters and ideas that resonate with you.

Reading physical books or even ebooks requires more concentration and time, whereas audiobooks can be listened to while multitasking. I'd imagine that's a big part of how people manage to read so many books in a week, by listening during their free time while doing other things. But as the original poster said, it's hard to understand because everyone's situation, reading speed, and available resources are different. For me, I find that reading short books, especially YA ones, helps a lot. But ultimately, it depends on what works best for each individual.",

I only recently found out that people don't 'speak' every word in their head while reading when I was discussing it with my husband... I was confused at how fast he read and he was confused when I said I can\u2019t read the words unless I say them. I think that's interesting, maybe that's why it takes me so much longer to read books than others. Maybe I should give audiobooks a try. Thanks for sharing this!",

Ensure you read short books: Choose novellas, short stories, or smaller books rather than epic fantasy trilogies or dense historical novels that require more time and mental energy to read and comprehend.\n        2. Find an audio book version: Listening to books while driving, exercising, or completing household chores can significantly increase your reading speed and allow for multitasking.\n        3. Use the audiobook to \"read\" during otherwise wasted time: Listen to books while commuting, waiting in line, or during leisure activities like cooking or cleaning.\n        4. Schedule dedicated reading time: Create a routine or schedule dedicated reading time each day or week to help you stay consistent and make it a habit.\n        5. Prioritize book reading by setting goals: Setting a goal to read a certain number of books in a given period helps you prioritize and stay accountable for meeting your reading objectives.\n        6.

I read while I'm eating breakfast, lunch, or even while catching up on some TV shows or movies. It does help to read books around 300 pages, or I might listen to audiobooks for longer books. It's also interesting to see how much information I retain over time when I'm reading consistently. It feels great to complete a book each week!",

I usually read both physical books and e-books, and on some days, I do listen to audiobooks during my commute or while doing chores.\n\n        3. I don't have time to remember everything I read, but I do remember significant details and key insights from the books I read.\n\n        4. To make it more manageable, I choose to read shorter books often or skip chapters or sections with less importance and skim over summarized parts of longer novels.\n\n        5.
