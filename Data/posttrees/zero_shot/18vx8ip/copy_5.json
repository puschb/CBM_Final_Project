    "content": "I keep saying stories and posts about challenges like 52 books a year etc, and simply don't understand how people do it. With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

            "comment_text": "If you want to read a book a week, consider a few strategies. First, prioritize reading as a non-negotiable activity. This means making it part of your daily routine, even for a short time each day.\n\n        Second, read books that are suitable for your reading pace. If you find a book particularly difficult or not engaging, it can slow down your reading progress. Try a variety of genres and authors to find what you enjoy the most.\n\n        Third, utilize audiobooks for longer commute times, trips, or multitasking tasks. It can help you consume more content while doing other activities.\n\n        To retain more information, take notes, summarize key points, discuss with others, or ask yourself questions while reading. A common mnemonic technique is the \"Method of Loci,\" where you imagine placing objects at specific points in a familiar location to help remember information better.\n\n        Lastly",

Others, though? They feel like they're taking forever, even at a relatively quick pace. And it's not just about time, either; some books are just so captivating that you can't help but burn through them.\n\n        As for the audio part, well, I've personally found that I can get through an average novel in about 8 hours, give or take. And as for retaining information? I mean, I mostly remember the gist of things, but the details? Those tend to fade faster than I'd like.\n\n        Speaking of details, I might have to check out that Wax and Wayne series someone else mentioned; sounds interesting! Thanks for the recommendation!\n\n        (I still don't get the whole reading",

If it's under 10 hours, I generally won't bother unless it's from an author or narrator I really enjoy. I'm curious, do you mainly listen to audiobooks or do you sometimes switch to a hard copy, eBook, or even an abridged version if the original is too long? I've been thinking about trying out some abridged versions recently, but I'm not entirely sure if I'll like them or not since I tend to enjoy knowing every little detail about characters and plot lines. What do you think about abridged versions? Have you tried any or do you prefer the full length?",

Most of her books are under 10 hours, so they're perfect for those looking for a quick read to bump up their annual tally. The Discworld books are a good choice too. They've got the right blend of humor, fantasy, and mystery that makes for an enjoyable listen, even if they go over the 10-hour mark sometimes. Happy reading (or listening)! \ud83d\udcda\ud83c\udfa7\u2728\n        \n         PS: If you're interested, I'd recommend giving \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\" by Agatha Christie a try.

Short books can be great too, but I'll likely buy them outright to save credits. Some authors and narrators are just better at keeping you engaged over long stories. \n\n        While some may argue the benefits of reading classics or important books, I'm more into the storytelling of modern and lesser-known works. Space operas, long series, and focused storytelling with a diverse cast of characters is what really hooks me. Altered Carbon is a perfect example of a book I wouldn't hesitate to use a credit on!\n\n        Now if you'll excuse me I've got a good ol' sci-fi adventure waiting for me on my Audible app. Happy reading (and listening)! \ud83d\udd96\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0c",

Plus, having a narrator read them can make them easier to consume while doing other activities, like driving or walking the dog. And there's nothing wrong with that.

Second, I try to focus on the narration more intently, so some of it might blur but I generally manage to absorb the main plot and overall feel of the book. Finally, I often combine reading with listening to double down on my reading time. I won't lie, it does take some time to get used to, but it's a bit like training a muscle! It's also worth noting that some books lend themselves better to speed reading than others, so don't worry if it's too much for one book, just try different paces or books to see what feels right for you!

I find it helpful to treat reading like any other important task, by setting aside a specific time each day to read. I also read a mix of genres and formats, including short stories, novels, non-fiction books, and audiobooks. I also find it important to read books that I'm genuinely interested in, as that makes it easier to stay engaged and retain the information. Lastly, I think it's important to recognize that you don't have to finish every book you start - if you find one isn't holding your interest, it's okay to put it down and try something else. Reading should be enjoyable above all else!\"",

I do other things like exercise, socializing, and watching TV, but I prioritize reading because it's important to me.

But back to the original question, I think the key to reading a book a week is making time for it. I agree with the sentiment that you can easily swap phone screen time for reading time, and if you make reading a priority, you can definitely find the time. Audio books are also a great way to sneak in some extra reading during long commutes or while doing chores around the house. I still believe it's important to have other hobbies outside of reading, but I don't think that's what you're asking. Do I actually retain a lot of what",

It's really easy to lose track of time on the phone when you're just casually scrolling, but having set limits helps force you to put it down and do something else, like pick up a book instead. It helps that I'm pretty lazy, so if I really need to, I can put my phone in a different room to avoid the temptation of picking it back up. My current \"go-to\" for motivation is to put my phone in a drawer upstairs, and sit down with the book I want to read, which is on a bookshelf downstairs. I find that it's much less tempting to pick up the phone if I have to go upstairs to get it. Plus, now that I've set limits on my apps, I've found that I have nothing to do with my phone when I hit those limits, so I usually end",

In my case, I've found that the phone has no pull over me. It generally stays in my pocket or on my desk, only used when I need to take a call or respond to something. This leaves me with more time for reading. For retaining information, it helps to focus on comprehending the content rather than rushing through the books. Short books can be beneficial, but it's not a necessity if you're willing to put in the time to read longer ones. Audio books can also be a good option for multitasking, but I find that I retain more information when I read physically.

Set specific times for phone usage, like a set time of the day, and stick to it. This can help reduce the overall time spent on the phone.\n       \n        2. Use app restrictions or tools like Freedom to limit time spent on distraction apps.\n       \n        3. Keep your phone out of reach during the times you want to focus on reading. This could mean leaving it in another room or turning it off completely.\n       \n        4. Reading a physical book instead of ebooks can help because the physical act of turning pages is a tangible reminder of the time spent reading.\n       \n        5. Find a reading group or accountability buddy to help motivate you to read consistently.\"\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything",

Consider putting your phone in another room when you read to avoid the urge to check it.\n\n        3) Start small. If 15-20 hours a week seems overwhelming, start with smaller time chunks. Even 15 minutes a day can add up to significant progress over time.\n\n        4) Focus on the benefits. Remind yourself of the benefits of reading and how it contributes to your personal growth and well-being. This can help motivate you to stick to your reading routine.\n\n        5) Use technology to your advantage. You can use apps like Forest or Freedom to block distracting websites and apps during your reading time.\n\n        6) Get a physical book.",

Having a Kindle with a stand makes it even more convenient as you don't have to hold the device. It's really just a matter of discipline and making reading a priority. If you can spare a couple of hours a day, you can definitely read a book a week. Now, if you find short books or audiobooks helpful, that's a personal preference and can certainly simplify things.

I read only on public transport, I use audio books, and I sacrifice time I would usually spend on social media or watching TV. But it's all worth it in the end.

Or, if you're not too fussed about the appearance of your books, you can always use small items around the house as makeshift bookweights, like a glass or a can of beans \u2013 whatever's handy.

And with a variety of books to choose from at the college library, there's no shortage of reading material.

Three, I do dabble in audiobooks, but not often because I love the experience of holding a real book in my hands.

I've found that I enjoy some narrators more than authors, so listening to a book can be a great way to still engage with the material even if it's not as immersive as a deep reading session.

This routine helps me stay committed, and I often find myself reading more than the daily target due to getting deeply engrossed in the story. It's essential to set a daily goal that feels achievable, as even reading 20 pages a day would still enable you to read more books than usual. Keep at it, and I hope 2024 brings you many happy reads!",

This might not be feasible for everyone with work and family commitments, but if you're interested in upping your reading game, you could try adjusting your schedule",

I think the reason my reading habits increased in 2020, even though I wasn't affected by lockdowns, is because I had more free time on my hands. With less work commitments due to remote work and fewer social outings, I found myself with more spare moments in the day that I could dedicate to reading. Plus, there were more hours in the day since I didn't have to commute to work anymore. I also think the isolation of lockdowns made people crave more escape and immersion into different worlds, which is why books became a popular choice for entertainment during that time.\n\n        \n        I know I'm not alone in this, as my Goodreads stats show a marked increase in the number of pages I read in 20",

I guess that's kind of like how some movies are easier and quicker to watch than others depending on their complexity and plot structure.

On the other hand, I can usually power through a romance novel in a day or two since they're generally easier to follow. It's all about finding what works best for each individual reader, I suppose.",

If you manage to read 10-15 pages an hour, it means you're reading a novel in 4-6 hours. That's quite a significant amount of time, so kudos to you for that. Regarding imagining the characters and thinking about the situations they're in while reading, that's completely normal behavior when reading. In fact, that's one of the key aspects of reading: immersing yourself in the story and losing track of time. Don't worry about your reading speed too much, just keep enjoying the books you read. And if you want to read more, I would recommend setting a goal like 20 pages a day instead of 50, which sounds too stressful for you. Good luck with your reading goals!",

One way to make it more manageable is to read shorter books or books with a quick pace. Audio books are also a great option if you can listen while commuting or doing chores around the house. It's certainly hard to retain everything you read, but the main benefit of reading for many people is enjoying the story and learning from the experiences of the characters, rather than memorizing every detail.

Set a reading goal: Having a goal can help motivate you to make time for reading. You could try to read a certain number of pages per day or per week.\n\n        2. Use audiobooks: Audiobooks can be a great way to fit reading into your day. You can listen while commuting, exercising, or doing chores.\n\n        3. multitask: You can read while doing other things like eating, walking, or waiting. You might be surprised how much content you can consume this way.\n\n        4. Prioritize: Decide what's important to you and make reading a priority. You might find that you can sacrifice some time watching TV or scrolling through social media to make time for reading.",

I don't think it's possible to read a book a week without sacrificing something else in your life, but it's definitely achievable if you're willing to put in the effort.",

Some people might even read multiple books at once, or read in chunks instead of every day. The key is finding what works best for your schedule and learning style.

I've found that shorter books also allow me to retain more information because I can focus better. I think audio books can also be a great way to maximize reading time, but for me personally, I prefer the feel of a physical book in my hands. Hope this helps!",

For instance, I often choose to read instead of watching TV or scrolling through social media.\n\n        2. I do listen to audiobooks, which can be done while commuting, exercising, or doing chores around the house. This helps me squeeze in more reading time during the day.\n\n        3. I focus on understanding the main themes and plot of the book rather than retaining every single detail. That way, I don't feel as though I need to spend hours revisiting sections to remember what happened.\n\n        4. Finally, I try to read a mix of longer and shorter books.
