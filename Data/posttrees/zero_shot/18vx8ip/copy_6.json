    "content": "I keep saying stories and posts about challenges like 52 books a year etc, and simply don't understand how people do it. With work, families and other commitments, and assuming the average book/novel takes anywhere from 15-20 hours to complete, where do people find the time? Do they ensure they read short books? Is it mostly audio books? Do you actually retain a lot of what you read?",

            "comment_text": "15-20 hours a week seems like a big chunk of time, but it's actually quite manageable. If you dedicate an hour a day to reading, that's 5 hours a week. Of course, the number of books you can finish in a week will vary depending on the length and complexity of the books you choose. I find that shorter, more straightforward books are easier to read quickly, but I also enjoy deeper, more complex novels that require more attention. And yes, I do retain a lot of what I read, but it's not always important to remember every detail. The main thing is to enjoy the experience and let the ideas and themes linger in your mind.\n\nAs for finding the time, it's all about prioritizing. Sometimes you have to sacrifice watching that extra episode of your favorite show to make time for reading. Audio books are also a great option if you're commuting or doing chores around the",

I personally find myself drawn to sci-fi and fantasy, with the occasional horror thrown in from King. The longer, epic space or fantasy operas with many characters are my favorites, although more focused stories like Altered Carbon also work for me. It's not that I won't go below 10 hours, but it takes something special to make me consider using a credit.\n\nShorter books can also be a better deal, financially speaking, so I'll sometimes buy lower-hour books if they're cheap enough and something I'm interested in to save the credit. I get two credits a month, which equals two books, so I like to go for long ones when I can, but it depends on the author and narrator.\n\nHopefully that's somewhat enlightening for anyone struggling to",

As the user pointed out, To Kill a Mockingbird isn't an average book, but even a typical novel isn't going to take 15-20 hours to read. Once you account for working hours, commuting, household chores, meals, socializing, and other hobbies, it's actually quite plausible to read for a couple of hours each day.\n\n         Personally, I enjoy having various hobbies and think it's important to engage in different activities. If someone spends their entire life with their head in books, they might miss out on some unforgettable, real-life moments.\n\n         For me, tackling 10-12 books a year seems entirely possible, especially since I make the effort to engage in other interests as well.

It seems like many people have more dedication and flexibility in their schedules than others. It's important to remember that everyone has different priorities and commitments.

Some people prefer to read for understanding and appreciation, while others might focus on memorization. It's all about what works best for you.

You're implying that TV watching is a necessary part of our lives, but reading is just as valid and engaging an activity. It's unfair to assume that people who read have no other hobbies because they have a preference for one form of entertainment over another.\n\n         From your comment history, it seems you enjoy literature, discussing various books and characters. That is certainly a hobby! My point is, hobbies can come in many forms. Just because someone enjoys reading over TV, it doesn't mean they have no other interests. People have different priorities and preferences, and they should not be judged for that.\n\n         Regarding the book-a-week challenge, I'd say it boils down to personal discipline and lifestyle choices.

Secondly, I tend to choose shorter books to read, focusing on compact storytelling or books that are simply quick reads.

Reading a book in a month is definitely achievable, and it's great that you're sticking to an hour per night.

A normal person can finish a book in a couple of days or a week at most, not a whole month. You may want to consider upping your reading game if you can't find the time in a shorter span. :)\nUser 2: This comment is just a copy paste of the original comment. But I think I understand the original commenter's point after re-reading the comments. So, I have a different answer from the AI:\n\nIt's interesting that the time span varies greatly for reading a book. While some take 15-20 hours to complete, some can finish within a day or two on average. The difference is likely due to different reading speeds. I also reconsider the time I spend on reading after reading your comment. I read for an hour a night, which I thought was a reasonable timeframe,",

Set specific times for phone usage, and stick to them diligently. Avoid using your phone outside of designated time slots.\n\n         2. Keep your phone in another room when you want to read. Physical distance can help curb the temptation to check it constantly.\n\n         3. Download a reading app that blocks phone notifications during designated reading times. This can help eliminate the little pings and vibrations that can pull you away from your book.\n\n         4. Use a screen dimmer or blue light filter on your phone, and make a rule that you only use your phone in specific areas of your home (like a designated \"phone zone\") with good lighting. This can help train your brain to associate reading with a specific place and atmosphere, making it easier to stay focused.",

You could start with a short time slot and gradually increase it as you get used to it.\n\n        2. Remove distractions: Put your phone away during reading time. If possible, find a quiet place to read, or use apps that help block notifications or limit phone usage.\n\n        3. Find a reading buddy: Having someone to share books or discuss what you've read can make reading feel less isolating and make it more enjoyable.\n\n        4. Make it a habit: Like any new habit, it takes time to stick. Consistency is key.\n\n        5. Read about topics that really interest you: That way, you",

Reading and eating food are two different activities, so it's not clear how switching one for the other would provide more reading time. However, if you're referring to multitasking, I'd advise against that. Reading requires focus to process and understand the text, and eating requires attention to chew, swallow, and digest food. It might be possible to do both at the same time, but the quality of your reading and your dining experience would likely suffer. Perhaps you could try to find short breaks in your day to dedicate to reading instead. Good luck with your reading challenge!",

I personally read books before bed instead of watching TV, or during lunch breaks, commutes, or whenever I find some free time. For books that are too long or dense to read in a week, I often read multiple books at once or take breaks in between. Also, make sure to choose books that engage you as it'd be easier to stay focused on them. But at the end of the day, I think it's okay to take your time when reading and not push yourself to read a certain number of books per year or per week.

After struggling with visual processing for years, I finally found a solution that allows me to maximize both my visual and auditory skills.\n        \n        Firstly, you need to have an ebook or audiobook on your device or computer. Next, you download and install a TTS application like \"NaturalReader\" or \"IVONA\". These programs have the ability to read any text aloud, and you can choose from different voices as well.\n\n        Here's the step-by-step process I use: \n        1. Open your ebook or audiobook on your preferred device (I prefer to use my Kindle or an e-reader app like Kindle for PC). \n        2. Select the text you want to have read aloud.",

Plus, it doesn't require a subscription like some other apps. If you're not a fan of the text-to-speech, you could always give LibriVox a shot for real people reading public domain works aloud. Libby is another great resource for borrowing digital audiobooks from your local library.\n\n         If you're looking for a quicker and easier way to access books, a combined text-and-audio approach might be just what you need.

However, for those who can, here are a few strategies:\n        \n        1. Set a specific, realistic hourly reading target that fits your schedule, and stick to it. Make reading a part of your daily routine, like exercising or eating meals.\n        \n        2. Read multiple books at once. This technique allows you to read a chapter or two of each book during your reading time, giving you variety and preventing boredom.\n        \n        3. Focus on shorter books or shorter chapters to save time. A typical novel is around 300 pages, but there are plenty of shorter, more manageable books available.\n        \n        4. Listen to audiobooks during your commute, workouts, or chores. This can help you 'read' a book while doing something",

I do this because I like to have a physical copy of the book in my hands, and I find I retain more information when I read the words myself rather than hearing someone else read them to me.\n\n         Some of my favorite books that I would highly recommend are:\n\n         1. \"The Great Gatsby\" by F.

Plus, with all the extra free time, I found myself gravitating towards reading as a way to keep busy and entertained. How about you?\n* * *\n\n         The user you are mimicking seems to enjoy literature, especially the Realm of the Elderlings series, and has a high reading speed, though not as fast as some. They also mention that a sticking strategy helps them track their reading progress. In response to a comment about how some people continue to read quickly despite not having their reading speed improve with practice, they discuss their reading habits in 2020 and attribute it to lockdowns providing more convenience and time to read.",

As for the type of book, it may help to balance out difficult reads with lighter novels. I personally find that my brain retains more information from books that I read slowly and delve deeper into, rather than rushing through multiple books in a short period of time.

The afterworld of a book was crying-worthy, so I can see why some people read 52 books a year! Just find what works for you.",

I'm not really sure what you mean by \"blazing\" through books - but for me, it means reading quickly and keeping a steady pace without getting bogged down by visualizing details. I can see where others might find value in visualizing - but for me, it's just not something I do. But to each their own, I guess! Maybe give audio books a shot if you find the visualization part slow you down. Good luck with your reading challenge!",

As for finding time to read, my husband and I have been reading together for over 20 years and have completed around 2000 books. I found that setting a goal to read 50 pages a night before bed has worked well for me. It doesn't always work out, but most weeks I average 250-300 pages, which translates to about a book a week depending on the book's writing style. And besides the obvious benefit of expanding my knowledge and imagination, reading in bed has become an excellent way to wind down and get a good night's sleep without",

It's essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle by incorporating various activities into our daily lives. I also appreciate your perspective on the complexity of human species, as we indeed require a diverse set of experiences to grow and thrive.\n        \n         Maybe what we find \"unhealthy\" is not just the act of reading itself, but the pressure we put on ourselves to meet unrealistic expectations or the sense of guilt for spending time on our interests",

If you enjoy reading, do it at your pace. And perhaps, instead of focusing on reading books, consider exploring some new hobbies too. After all, variety is the spice of life.\n\n         As for the time issue, it's all about prioritizing. If reading is important to you, you can make time for it, like I do while driving. However, you might find that spending all your free time reading isn't the most fulfilling way to use that time.\n\n         So, keep reading what you enjoy, and remember to enjoy the journey, not the destination. :)\n\n         P.S.

Prioritize reading: Treat reading like a commitment, and dedicate specific time each day or week for it. If you make it a priority, it's easier to find time for it.\n\n        2. Choose your books wisely: Not every book needs to be a 500-page epic. There are great stories in shorter, quick reads as well. You can find many highly-rated books that are shorter in length.\n\n        3. Make it a habit: Reading a little bit each day makes it easier to finish a book within a week. Even if it's just 15 minutes each day, it adds up.\n\n        4. Multi-task when possible: Audiobooks are a great way to squeeze some extra reading in while commuting, walking, or cooking",

As for audio books, they can definitely be a lifesaver when it comes to fitting in reading with a busy schedule, but they don't always work for me because I find myself needing to rewind and re-listen to passages. And in terms of retention, I'd say it's a bit hit-or-miss. Some books stick with me for a long time, while others I can barely remember a week later.\n\n        2.

I enjoy taking my time and savoring the story, but I've also noticed that my reading pace has improved since I started reading more frequently. Listening to books can definitely increase the number you can read, but the type of book also plays a factor. Popular fiction/sci-fi/fantasy books tend to go quickly, but more complex or challenging books can take more time to digest. I personally think speed reading challenges can sometimes become counterproductive and take away from the enjoyment of reading.

Some people may have a faster reading speed or have more free time, which allows them to read more books in a year. If you want to read more, you could try listening to audio books during your commute, taking breaks to read during work if possible, or reading smaller books. However, the amount you retain may be less when listening rather than actively reading. You may also find that your reading speed improves over time as you practice more. As for the Witcher series, it's actually quite long and the later books can be slow, focusing on politics and character development more than action. If you're not interested in that, you might want to consider another series or book. And no, I don't think you need to annotate books for them to be meaningful or enjoyable.",

Choose shorter books: There are many excellent books in the 150-300 pages range. This allows you to finish a book in less than a week.\n\n        2. Set a schedule: Make reading a priority and schedule specific times in your day to read. For example, reading in the morning before work or during lunch breaks.\n\n        3. Multi-task: Listen to audio books while working out, commuting, or doing household chores.\n\n        4. Speed-read: If you want to read faster, practice speed-reading techniques.
