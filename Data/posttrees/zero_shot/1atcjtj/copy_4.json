    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

I still haven't finished \"All the Pretty Horses,\" but I've heard great things about it.\n\nAs for me, I prefer reading in silence. No distractions, just the words taking me away.\"",

The part that got me choked up was reading about a woman's grief when her husband unexpectedly dies. I found myself tearing up several times throughout the book as I empathized with the protagonist's pain and her struggle to move forward. It was a real gut punch, but also a beautifully written journey through loss and healing. Hope your reading adventures continue to move you in the ways books often do!",

John Irving's prose leaves you shattered and elated at the same time. A lesser known work of his is A Widow For One Year. I read it at a time when my life was in turmoil and I literally sobbed my way through it the grief was palpable. And yes, it was definitely one of the most unique, gut-wrenching books I've ever read.

It resonated with such poignant, raw emotion that I found myself sobbing more than once. The grief he depicted was palpable, and I felt compelled to pause reading at times just to manage the emotional toll. It's a testament to his ability as a novelist that he could make me feel so intensely invested in a tale. Now, Legend by David Gemmell has also earned a special place in my heart for its ability to evoke similar feelings. What heart-wrenching reads have left you emotional?",

The bond between Old Dan and Little Ann, the dogs, and Billy, the main character, was one of the best depictions of friendship I had ever read. And when the fateful day came for one of the dogs, I just couldn't hold back the tears. It's a book that has stayed with me throughout the years and I still get a little sentimental whenever I think about it. What about you? any books that gave you an emotional punch?",

It's like they tap into a deeper part of ourselves that we often don't even realize exists. I remember reading \"Where the Red Fern Grows\" to my son, and I started tearing up all over again. It's interesting how some books can hit us in unexpected ways, isn't it? Maybe it's because we're reading it from a different perspective or with a different heart this time around. Anyway, I'm glad to hear that \"Legend\" affected you in such a profound way. Those are the books that stick with us, aren't they? Keep reading and enjoy the ride!",

I remember trying to re-read *To Kill a Mockingbird* a few years back, and it just didn't have the same effect it did when I was younger. Maybe it was a little too raw or too close to home or something, but it just didn't work out the same way. It's funny how our perspectives change, isn't it? Books can have a different impact on us at different points in our lives. One of my favorite examples I came across was a colleague who absolutely loved *Lord of the Rings* as a kid but loathed it as an adult. I guess, in the end, it's all about finding the stories that resonate with us at any given moment. What do you think, any other books that have hit you at just the right time?",

I spent a whole summer with him, and then about 6 months later he got lost in the woods. My family and I searched everywhere, but couldn't find him. It was a devastating loss, and looking back, I realize the impact he had on my life. \n\n         That book seems to have a similar effect on some people. The power of the written word is amazing, and I'm grateful for books and authors that can elicit such strong emotions. If it's not too",

It's a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for what's right and confronting ignorance and prejudice head-on. \n\nWhat was the first book that made you cry or get choked up, and why?",

Every time I read it, it feels like the characters are my friends and I feel every bit of their struggles. There are quite a few emotional highs and lows throughout the book, but some scenes that always get me are Valjean meeting Cosette when he sees her for the first time, the way Javert kills himself when he realizes that he had been deceived, and Cosette and Marius's wedding at the end, it is such a beautiful scene, but I always end up crying. It's honestly one of the best books I've ever read and I highly recommend it to anyone. What was the first book that ever made you cry?",

I remember feeling a profound sadness when Scout realizes the extent of racism in her small town and understands that her father, Atticus, isn't able to change it as much as she'd hoped. It was a sobering realization for such a young character and made me appreciate the book all the more.\n\n        Reading \"The Secret History\" by Donna Tartt also brought me to tears. The book's suspenseful atmosphere and the tragic fate of the characters really got to me. It was a reminder that no matter how smart or special you think you are, life has a way of bringing you down to earth.\n\n        What about you? Have any books made you cry or get emotional?

There's a scene where a fox explains to the Little Prince that he is taming him, and that in a way, he's taming all of the Earth. It really struck a chord with me and made me realize how precious the world and our relationships are. It's a truly beautiful book, full of life lessons",

It seemed like Pullman was trying to push too many new ideas in one go, rather than weaving them seamlessly into the narrative like he did in the previous books.

That book and movie had an impact on me at a young age that still lingers, and I would highly recommend it to readers of any age!\n\n         (I did have high hopes for the A Dog's Purpose book, but the movie was a complete and utter disaster... So awful!)\n\n         \n\n         P.S. -- I think it's unfortunate that you had a negative experience with the first Bridgerton book. I",

The story of the young shepherd following his dream really spoke to me at that time in my life when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I also liked the themes of following your destiny and not listening to others, which I found very inspiring. I still go back to it every now and then when I need a reminder to believe in myself and follow my dreams. What was the first book that made you cry or get choked up? Why? (Maybe spoilers)",

I can definitely relate to getting emotionally invested in characters and then being heartbroken when something tragic happens to them. When I read \"A Song of Ice and Fire,\" it was hard for me to deal with all the character deaths, especially when Ned Stark got his head severed. Reading about the emotions he felt in those last moments was a real gut punch for me. It's always tough to see good people getting hurt or killed in books, but it really makes the books feel more real and emotionally resonant. Hopefully, you find a similar experience with Martin the Warrior. Cheers! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\ude80",

I've never read that series, but I've seen the movies and they were certainly intense. I can imagine the impact they would have on a reader.\n\n        For me, it was \"Legend\" by David Gemmell that left me emotional. The character Druss's journey to rescue his wife was so compelling that I found myself tearing up at several points throughout the book. The bond between the characters in that story really resonated with me.\n\n        Have you read any other books that have had a similar emotional impact on you? I'd love to hear about them if you have.",

The scene where Anna decides to end her life on the railway tracks, the weight of her actions, the pain and regret, the burden she has carried, it was devastating. Absolutely heartbreaking. I remember being in tears and feeling the weight of life's burdens, and the struggle of love and self-worth. I read many books after that, but none have moved me as much as Tolstoy's works have. I can't help but go back to his books again and again.",

It's told through Charlie's diary entries, and as his intelligence levels increase, so does his writing ability. It's really a fantastic study of not just what it means to be human, but also the cruel nature of time and our own mortality.\n\nThat book has that rare ability to punch you straight in the feels.

It's a novel about a man with an IQ of 68 who undergoes an experimental surgery to increase his intelligence. The story is told through a series of letters, diary entries, and progress reports written by the main character, Charlie Gordon.\n\n        The protagonist's intellectual growth and subsequent decline is heartbreaking. He experiences the joys and challenges of learning and discovering the world around him, only to see it all slip away as his intelligence starts to regress. The ending is a real punch to the gut, and I couldn't help but feel sad and emotionally spent after reading it.\n\n        'Flowers for Algernon' is a book that stays with you long after you've finished it, and I highly recommend giving it a read if you haven't already.\n\n        Have a wonderful day!",

It's such a heartbreaking story about a man with an intellectual disability who undergoes an experimental surgery to increase his IQ and follow his journey in navigating the world and forming relationships as he grows more intelligent. However, as the story progresses, his intelligence gradually regresses back to his initial level, showing the transience of his success and the heartbreaking realisation of the limited time he had to enjoy it. I read it in high school and it has stayed with me ever since. I highly recommend it if you have not yet read it.

The protagonist, Severian, is a young apprentice torturer at the Citadel of Time and Power, and I found that his journey really captivated me.\n\nThere's a specific scene that particularly stands out. Severian faces a judgment in the Hall of the Inquisitors, and they ask him what he would choose to do if he had the choice to change his future. His response is, \"I would change nothing.

The Red Pony is a timeless classic that can definitely tug at the heartstrings.

There's something so comforting and yet bittersweet about returning home after a wild, tumultuous journey.

The profound emotional impact was amplified by the subtle, yet profound, way it touched on the human condition, even amidst an unconventional backdrop. It was a profound reading experience that, despite not being a textbook, still left me emotional and introspective.",

The ending was particularly devastating, and I had to set the book aside for a few days before I could finish it. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it, but tissues will be a necessity!",

The book tells the story of two Afghan women, Mariam and Laila, and how they struggle through life under the Taliban regime.\n\n        Mariam, who was born out of wedlock to a man who later abandons her, lives a harsh life with her cruel first husband. Laila, on the other hand, is raised by a loving family but is torn away from them when she is forced to marry Rasheed, Mariam's abusive husband.\n\n        The book is heartbreaking as you watch these two women suffer through domestic abuse, war, and loss.
