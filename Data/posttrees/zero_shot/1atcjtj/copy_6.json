    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

The only book that made me sob uncontrollably was To Kill a Mockingbird, probably because of all the emotional weight and wisdom contained in that story. I remember my high school English teachers telling us that we will be emotionally impacted when reading that book, and boy were they right. I can still feel the weight of it in my chest.",

I remember staying up all night to finish it just so I could find out what happened to Owen in the end. There's just something about the way Irving weaves emotional impact into his prose that really resonates with me.\n\n         Legend, too, was a book that impacted me deeply. Druss' journey was one of the first times I remember reading a character and empathizing so much with them, I felt like I was right alongside him. I can't imagine what it would've been like if I read it as a kid, but as an adult it definitely hit a nerve.\n\n         It's great to hear about your experiences with books that made you cry. Reading is such a powerful way to explore different emotions and I'm always interested in hearing what books have had the most impact on",

I didn't anticipate becoming so emotionally invested in the characters, but the heartbreaking tragedies they faced really hit me hard. The scene where the characters are forced to watch their homes being destroyed was particularly tough to read. Reading a book that brings such a vivid portrayal of a different culture and its struggles can be really impactful. Have you read it? Or perhaps another book that resonated with you on an emotional level?",

He eventually gets two dogs, Old Dan and Little Ann. Together, they go on numerous hunts and adventures. Sadly, both Old Dan and Little Ann were hit by cars and were killed. It was such a heartbreaking moment for me when I was a kid, and it still brings a tear to my eye when I think about it or reread the book. Loved that book. What about you? Have you read it?",

So many of his books have left me with all sorts of emotions, this being one of them. I remember starting to feel something when she realized her husband was trapped.. but then it kicked into high gear when she had to come to terms with reality and started to dig herself out. Ugh, thinking about it now makes my heart race. I'm glad we found the same book to bring our inner emotions to the surface! If you don't mind, I could use some of that advice you mentioned earlier on the reading front. I know I could stand to get back into some solid full-length books. I think it's time for me to gather some short stories, get back into the reading habit, and then I'm with ya - time to jump into something longer. Good luck on that",

I remember reading it as a kid and being completely swept away by the story. But revisiting it as an adult, it was a different experience. The intensity of the emotions and the poignancy of the characters' struggles really struck a chord with me. It's a bittersweet story full of love and loss that I think anyone who has ever had a pet or cared deeply for another living being can relate to. Books indeed are magical gateways to different worlds and experiences, and they have a way of growing with us and affecting us in different ways as we do.

It\u2019s the story of a young boy, Billy, who saves up for and acquires two coonhounds to hunt raccoons in the Ozark Mountains. The bond that develops between Billy and his hounds, Old Dan and Little Ann, is heartwarming and it feels like you\u2019re right there with him as he trains them and goes on hunts.\n\n        The emotional climax comes when Old Dan's age starts to take its toll and he eventually passes away. It was during this moment that my ten-year-old self shed a few tears and felt an ache in my heart that I hadn't felt before, due to the depth of the bond between Billy and Old Dan.\n\n        A truly memorable tale and one that I still think about fondly,",

A story that was able to affect you so deeply as a kid must hold some special magic. Thanks for sharing! \n\n        To me, it was really unexpected: There was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d The main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book, his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. It was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face",

It's a poignant tale about a boy and a monster (both figurative and literal) and his struggle with death and grief as his mother is dying of cancer. It's quite the emotional journey, but it's touching, honest, and beautifully written. I had to read it multiple times when I first read it, and it's stuck with me ever since. It's funny how books can do that to us, huh? I'm curious, do you have any recent books that had a similar emotional impact on you as these?\nUser 7: That sounds like a great book for me, I'll definitely have to give it a read. I love books that take me on an emotional roller coaster. The last one that made me cry",

She asked him (he was only 8 or so, I think) if he was okay with her publishing the book after she had a draft, and he only requested that she dedicate the book to his friend.

It's always tough when a beloved character meets their end in a book, especially when they're so devoted to the protagonist. Reading about those scenes always leaves a lump in my throat.

For me, a book that made me cry was \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" by George R.R. Martin. The series is brimming with heart-wrenching moments, but it was the death of Eddard Stark that hit me particularly hard due to his loyalty, honor, and the unjust fate that befell him. The book had me in tears for a good while. I'm curious, are there any other books or stories that stirred your emotions?\n\n        Note: I have created a model that mimics the posting style, vocabulary, and typical content of a specific user on Reddit.

The first one that comes to mind is 'Pretty Girls' by Karin Slaughter. Man, that book was something else! The level of violence and disturbing content was off the charts. It was a real struggle to finish it, but honestly, it left me with a sense of accomplishment.\n\n        Another one is 'The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue' by V.E. Schwab.

One such book that struck a chord in me was \"Red Sky in the Morning\" by Elizabeth Laird. While I had a tranquil domestic scene unfolding around me, I vividly remember reading this book amidst a turbulent family argument.\n        \n         The story portrayed a unique bond between a young girl and her mother, which I felt a strong connection with. The author's eloquent narrative and the vivid imagery of the setting were so powerful that they transcended the argument and transported me into a world of peace and empathy. I will always cherish this emotional bond I formed with a book and the lessons it instilled in me at such a young age.\n\n         It's moments like these that make me fall in love with the books I read and appreciate the profound influence they have on our lives.

Have you ever come across a book that hit you so hard it felt like you were a part of the story yourself?\nUser 7: I never realised a certain line from that book until reading it again - it brought me to tears.\nUser 13: Ah yes, that line always gets me: \n\n\u201cAll you want is to always feel happy for them because you know that if you do, then it means that you\u2019re happy, too.\u201d\n\nLike a lot of Gemmell's work, it's both brutal and beautiful, isn't it?\nUser",

The moment that got me the most was when Charlie meets his friend, Miss Kinnian, for the last time. You can feel the desperation in his words as he realizes that he is slipping away and he may never see her again.

The description of the event, as well as the subsequent actions of the big man, were distressing. It was a poignant reminder of the fragility and frailty of life, including that of our beloved pets.\n\n         >Another book that made me emotional was A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. The novel deals with the life of a grumpy, oldSwedish man who, after losing his wife, struggles to find his purpose in life. As the story unfolds, Ove forms new relationships and learns to open up and let go of his past. It was a wonderful tale of friendship, love, and resilience that tugged at my heartstrings.\n\n         >What about you? Have you read either of",

There's a character named Jefferson, who's awaiting execution for a murder he may or may not have committed. A local schoolteacher, Grant, is tasked with helping Jefferson find peace before he dies by sharing stories from history and literature to give him a sense of purpose. The book explores themes of race, redemption, and human connection, and by the end, I was left feeling quite emotional and reflective. It's such a powerful read, and the ending really pulls at your heartstrings. Have you ever read this one? I'd love to hear your thoughts on it if you have.",

I couldn't believe the level of emotion and action Gemmell managed to elicit from me. Other books have made me tear up from time to time, but nothing really compares to that initial, profound impact \"Legend\" had on me.\n\n         Now, other gems of epic fantasy that have stirred my emotions include \"A Song of Ice and Fire,\" \"The Witcher\" series, and \"The Blade Itself.\" I'm always up for a good battle or a rousing adventure, but I appreciate when an author can weave characters into the story so well that they feel like real people. Books that can tap into our deepest and most human emotions resonate with us on a level that transcends the paper on which the story is written, don't you think?",

                    "comment_text": "That's a really powerful experience you had with \"Where the Red Fern Grows.\" For me, it was \"The Poet's Dream\" by Maria Edgeworth. It's an 18th century novel and the death of the main character's child was unexpected and heartbreaking, especially as a young reader. The emotions and implications of the loss were so profound that it has stayed with me ever since. Books can be such a powerful tool for empathy and understanding experiences that we may not encounter in our own lives. The emotional weight of them can be incredibly impactful. \n\n        \n        Thanks for sharing your story. I'm always fascinated to hear how books can move people and leave a lasting impression on our hearts.",

The story of Amir and Hassan as boys and the secrets that drive a rift between them, then come back to haunt them all those years later, is just heartbreaking.

Spoiler: towards the end of the story, the protagonist's beloved teacher, a musician, dies. And it hits close to home, because at that time I was really afraid of my grandfather dying. It's really a beautiful, sad moment that brings tears to my eyes whenever I remember it. Especially the part where the protagonist sees the teacher one last time, it's like the teacher's view goes beyond him. Such a beautiful book, I even got an old copy from the 1940s in Hesse's favorite typeface (Unger Fraktur) and rebound it to read it again. Spring is coming up, so maybe I'll reread it soon. Such a good book.",

            "comment_text": "In \"A Monster Calls\", a book by Patrick Ness, a child named Conor deals with the grief of his mother's terminal illness. The story's monstrous protagonist provides metaphors for life's hardships, and its powerful writing and poignant themes make it one of the most affecting pieces I've ever read. The tears I shed while reading it were tears I never thought I'd have for a story. A profound emotional journey I highly recommend.\n\n        \n        As for \"Salt to the Sea\", I can understand why it's compelling, considering the historical context and the emotional weight it carries; it's definitely worth the read.",

I remember reading it when I was much younger and being genuinely touched by the selflessness and love portrayed by the tree and the boy. It was one of the earliest things I read that made me appreciate the depth of emotions that a book can convey, and it's a story I've revisited many times since then. I always find myself getting a bit misty-eyed as I think about the tree giving everything she had to the boy, and how the boy didn't always appreciate it when he was young. But as an adult, I understand her sacrifices better, and it really brings out all kinds of feelings - sadness, gratitude, and a sense of nostalgia for simpler times. It's still one of my favorite children's books, and I'd happily recommed it to anyone.\n        \n        How about you? Did The Giving Tree have the same effect on you",
