    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

But watching the movie No Country for Old Men, then reading the book, was a unique experience that left me with a sense of unease yet a strange fascination.\n\n        Speaking of unease, I tried to read Heart of Darkness, but it proved too heavy for me. However, the audiobook narrated by Kenneth Branagh made it a lot more enjoyable.\"\n        (User responds like they have been reading/responding for a while)\n        (User responses include spoilers but they are not for the post)\n        (The user",

That book really grabs you and doesn't let go until the very end. Have you read any of John Irving's other works, or is Owen Meany your favorite? I've heard great things about Cider House Rules too, maybe I'll give it a read one day. Also, I remember Druss from the Drenai Saga too! He's definitely one of my favorite characters in epic fantasy. I can't say it made me cry quite as much as Owen Meany, but it still gave me some emotional moments that I won't forget.",

I actually read parts of it aloud to my wife because it was so gripping and I couldn't hide how I felt from her. There were multiple times I had to take a deep breath (and a few breaks!) before I could continue. It reminded me of something Druss would need to do in Legend as well, to keep pushing on.

For me, it's a toss-up between \"The Yearling\" by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and \"A Separate Peace\" by John Knowles. Both books had a profound impact on me as a young reader. \"The Yearling\" is a classic coming-of-age story about a boy's connection to nature and his beloved pet fawn. The ending is heartbreaking, but it made a deep impression on me at the time. \"A Separate Peace\" is a more complex novel about the aftermath of a friendship that is tested in wartime. The revelation towards the end of the book left me in tears. But even after revisiting these books as an adult, the emotional impact remains. Books can truly touch our lives in ways no other medium can. If you haven't gotten around to reading these, I recommend giving them a try!",

The way Gary Paulsen writes, the relationship between Billy and his dogs, it just really resonated with me. When Old Dan died, I literally couldn't read for a good half hour. But then Billy goes and gets Little Ann, and it's bittersweet because you know everything's going to be ok, but it's not the same without Old Dan. And then, of course, when Little Ann gets shot, it's just so heartbreaking. It's a book that I still have on my shelf, and it's one that I'll probably always revisit from time to time.",

Though I have to admit that I was legit moved by the movie version of the 5th element at the very end of the credits with the music and all that...lost it a bit, but not full on weeping at the cinema. \n\nMost of my cries have been for literary classics that I feel a deep tie to in terms of our shared human condition, and The Grapes of Wrath fits that bill perfectly.

I cried so hard at the end when Wilbur had to be put down. What a great story, I never realized how profound it is for a book for kids. Is it your favorite children's book? I still remember the characters vividly, including Templeton the rat. \n\n        \n        By the way, have you read any of David Gemmell's other books? I actually just finished his Starlark series (or Troy Trilogy), and it was amazing, too. If you liked Legend, I think you'd really enjoy those. The first one is called Starlark, but there are two companion books, Dark Prince and Hero in the Shadows, that take place before Starlark but were written after, so they're a little different but still awesome.",

The scene really hit me hard, because I saw a bit of myself in Ron.\n\n         There have been a few other books that have made me tear up since then, but that first one stands out as the most impactful.

For me, similar to David Gemmell's Legend, it was Redwall as well. The scene when Friar Munro dies in the first book, I felt such a connection with the characters that the whole series has been a ride I wouldn't trade for the world.\n\n        Reading about Rose's end in Martin the Warrior was an entirely different experience. First encounter with death in a book and the overwhelming emotional response, yeah, I didn't see that coming at all, either. But somehow it added to the charm of the whole Redwall series, don't you think? Reading about such emotional moments only makes reading more meaningful. :)\n\n        Let me know if you've got any other favorite emotional reading experiences!",

The way Louisa May Alcott wrote her character's struggle with her medical condition and the poignant moments leading up to her death really tug at the heartstrings. Not many books have had that kind of emotional impact on me though. Have you read any book that's had a profound effect on you in some way?\n\nIn case you haven't read the book, *Little Women* is about four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy - growing up in Civil War era Concord, Massachusetts. The story follows their personal growth, their relationships, and their experiences as a family. Beth, the youngest sister, is the most sensitive, kind, and artistic of the sisters, and her eventual death from scarlet fever really emphasizes the fragility and ephemeral nature of life.",

The story of Charlie, a man with an IQ of 68 who undergoes a experimental procedure to raise his intelligence, and the subsequent decline at the end, really hit me at my core. The novel perfectly captures the feelings of fear, sadness, and loss as Charlie gradually loses his newfound intelligence and descends back into his original condition. It was an emotional rollercoaster, and one that I won't easily forget. What's the first book that made you cry, and why?",

I found myself tearing up several times while reading, particularly when Laila's daughter, Aziza, passes away. I couldn't recommend this book more if you love a good cry. \ud83d\udc99",

The book was about African American maids working for white families in the 1960s in Jackson, Mississippi, in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement. The relationships and struggles of the characters were so honest and emotional that it was impossible not to feel for them. I think this book is a great reminder of the power of storytelling in changing perspectives and opening our hearts to people who have different experiences and struggles than our own.",

I still remember the feeling of turning that final page and knowing that there would be no more adventures in that magical world. It was a bittersweet ending that left a lasting impression on me.\n\n        I've re-read the series multiple times as an adult, and it holds up today just as well as it did when I was a kid. There's something about the timeless messages in those stories that appeals to me. Plus, the characters are so well-written and endearing, I can't help but get attached to them.

The story spans several decades, and through it all, I felt deeply invested in the lives and stories of the various characters.\n        However, what ultimately choked me up was a very sudden and poignant scene where the central villain died after a sudden and horrible accident.

While it's not a book per se, an organic chemistry textbook did manage to tug at my heartstrings a bit.\n\n        It was the chapter on Hydrogen Bonding. The way the textbook described how a simple molecule like water could form such intricate structures, and how these structures could determine a multitude of phenomena, really got me in awe. It was that moment when I realized the immense beauty and complexity in the tiny, seemingly insignificant things that makeup our world. That realization sort of hit me like an emotional wave, and left me with a profound sense of curiosity and delight. I was choked up, not by a character's fate or a poignant plot twist, but by the sheer beauty of the scientific world around us.\n\n        What about you?

The first was the bond between Meg and her father, which was so beautifully portrayed. The second was the message of the story, which was about love, hope, and acceptance.\n\nI remember feeling a sense of loss when Meg's father first disappeared, and then a sense of triumph when they were reunited.

Sara's spirit never falters, however, and she finds joy and solace in her stories and her dreams.

And to top it all off, when they all reunite as adults 18 years later, I couldn't help but shed a tear or two. The emotional moments scattered throughout this book really tugged at my heartstrings.

As for me, I don't think there is a specific book that has ever made me cry, but I always shed a tear during a particular chapter in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee, even after multiple rereads. The scene in which Scout realizes the weight and impact of prejudice is always a difficult one for me to read. It's like a punch to the gut every time. Maybe that's because it also raises a level of anxiety about societal expectations and humanity itself. I guess I can relate to that, being anxious people ourselves, right? I would love to hear about emotional moments in reading that hit you hard too.",

The part where Gus dies really got me, I was a mess for days after finishing the book.

The story follows the journey of the eponymous last samurai, Gintaroo, as he navigates the end of the Edo period and the arrival of foreigners in Japan. As a history buff, the cultural and historical accuracy of the novel resonated deeply with me.\n         \n          > But it was the character development and the emotional journey that Gintaroo and a Japanese woman, Anna, shared that made the book. Their forbidden love transcended cultural and societal norms in a tumultuous time, and their relationship unfolded against the backdrop of a changing Japan. It truly made me shed a tear or two! I highly recommend it if you like historical fiction with intriguing characters and fascinating historical settings.\n         \n>>>>",
