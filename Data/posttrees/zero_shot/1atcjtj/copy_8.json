    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

It was one of the first books I read that had a profound impact on me, and it showed me the world in a way that no other book had before. The scene where Scout watches her father defend Tom Robinson was heartbreaking, and I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of sadness and frustration. The ending, with Tom's wrongful conviction, was another tearjerker. It really opened my eyes to the injustice and prejudice that exists in the world. Have you read it? What was the first book that made you cry?",

I've experienced that with other books too, like the Drenai Saga's Legend. I've also had moments where I've been really moved by a book, like in The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini, or A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. It's amazing how a book can touch you so deeply and leave a lasting impression. Have you read either of those? I'd love to hear about your emotional reading moments as well.",

Reading the last 50 pages of that book, I felt a whirlwind of emotion, similar to what you described when reading \"Legend\". There were several characters whose fates affected me greatly, but Owen Meany himself always stood out in a way that left me with a sense of finality and sorrow that was hard to shake off. I found it beautiful, the way Irving wove themes of faith, love, and morality throughout the story, using Owen's character as the vehicle for these concepts. I, too, felt a deep connection to the characters and found it challenging to put the book down at points. I can see now why it is one of Irving's most celebrated works. Thanks for sharing your emotional moment from reading!\"",

They ask the man and his son to stay, but the father feels the pull of the road away from them. Eventually, they realize that the father has been poisoned, and he's going to die. The son has to make the choice to either stay with the family and risk being killed or leave and find another way to survive.\n\n        I remember thinking about that choice for days after I finished",

The words \"Goodbye Francie\" from \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\" continue to pierce my heart, resonating with an uncanny familiarity.\n\n         It's fascinating how powerful our emotional connection to characters and stories can be.

The emotional connection that the author was able to build with the character Druss is impressive, to say the least. Although, I'd prefer something a bit more introspective and thought-provoking like George Orwell's \"1984\" or Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita\" which have a deeper level of psychological complexity that really makes you think and reflect upon society and the human condition.*",

I read it when I was around 9 years old, and there was a scene where the main character, Sara Crewe, was wrongly punished and treated badly by her school headmistress, Miss Minchin. Sara was made to do a lot of hard work and was given very little food to eat, and I remember feeling so sad and heartbroken for her. I ended up crying a lot while reading that part of the book.\n\n        It was such a powerful moment for me because I had never had to experience anything like that before, and it really made me understand the importance of kindness and empathy towards others. I also think that the book had a lot of themes that resonated with me at the time, such as the power of imagination and the idea that you should never judge someone based on their outward appearances.",

When Jess died, it felt like a part of me died as well. I remember feeling distraught and confused, and I didn't know how to deal with those intense emotions. It was a powerful and formative experience for me as a reader, and it taught me the power of a good book to make us feel deeply and think about themes that are important to us. It's still one of my favorites to this day. Kudos on your emotional journey with Legend as well, it sounds like a truly gripping read!\n\nP.S.

Both of these books have certainly left an indelible mark on me and I find myself getting choked up each time I read or think about them! \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

            "comment_text": "I've had a few books that have affected me deeply. One that immediately comes to mind is \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak. The story of a young girl named Liesel Meminger growing up in Nazi Germany was emotional and heart-wrenching from the start, but it was towards the end when things really got intense. The final chapters are set during the bombing of Munich in 1943, and the emotional impact of the story's resolution on both Liesel and the reader is palpable. As a dog lover, the climactic scene with Liesel's dog Max was particularly hard to read. It really stuck with me long after I finished the book, and I remember feeling physically drained after I closed the cover. It's definitely one of those books that's earned a permanent spot on my bookshelf.",

It's such a powerful, heart-wrenching story about women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. The story of two women, Mariam and Laila, and their lives, their love, their struggles, and their tragedies really got to me. The moments that stood out the most for me were Laila losing her husband, father, and daughter in a bombing, and Mariam's sacrifice with her son to give Laila and her children a better life. It was a hard read, but it was important and had such a profound impact on me. It made me appreciate my life and the love I have in it so much more. How about you?

The emotional growth of Charlie Gordon as he undergoes an experimental surgery to increase his intelligence, only to realize that intelligence doesn't necessarily equate to happiness, was heartbreaking. I found myself rooting for Charlie from the beginning, and when his regression hit, I couldn't help but cry for the character and what he went through.

The novel explores themes of faith and belief, and in the climactic scene, the small god Om commands the character Brutha to use his sword on him, essentially ending his own existence. The emotional weight of that moment, especially given the character development throughout the book, was quite profound and stuck with me for a long time.

The book follows an old man named Ove who has lived a hard life and has lost just about everything that was important to him. He's very set in his ways and is dealing with loneliness and grief.\n\n        Towards the end, when Ove starts to connect with his new neighbors and the wider community, it's a rollercoaster of emotions. The author does a fantastic job of describing the complexities of human emotions, and it's a beautiful, moving story. I ended up putting the book down for a few days because I just couldn't read anymore, I was so invested in Ove's story.\n\n        By the way, if you enjoy A Man Called Ove, I would highly recommend Backman's other works, like My Grandmother As",

The scenes involving Ponyboy's brother, Darry, resonated deeply with me. The raw emotion and sibling love portrayed in those pages are something I will always carry with me. It's a tale of brotherhood, loyalty, and loss, all woven into the fabric of a gripping story. Just as you found solace and a profound connection in \"Legend\", I too found a piece of myself within the pages of \"The Outsiders\". The books we read truly have the power to touch our souls. Keep reading, friend, and who knows what treasures you'll discover next. Cheers to shared stories and cherished words! \ud83c\udf7b",

The story revolves around four characters living in turbulent post-independent India, and it's a beautifully written tale of human resilience in the face of adversity. The narrative takes several emotional twists and turns, but the most impactful moment for me was when one of the main characters, Dina, loses her unborn child in a bombing raid. I found myself in tears and felt a profound sense of loss along with Dina. It's a heart-wrenching book that I highly recommend to anyone interested in contemporary literature from India.",

Reading can be such a beautiful escape, and it's amazing that it can evoke such strong emotions. For me, \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman did something similar, although in a different context. The protagonist, Ove, is such a flawed yet endearing character that I couldn't help but connect with him and root for him throughout the story. Reading about his journey and eventually witnessing his change for the better was a truly touching experience for me. What about you?

It's a poignant reminder to appreciate the relationships we have and cherish the people who have given so much to us.\n\n        I can relate to the emotional connection you feel with your reading. Recently, I picked up \"The Stand\" by Stephen King, and it absolutely tore me apart. There's just something about King's writing that speaks to the heart and gets you invested in",

The emotional journey of this book surely tugs at heartstrings, leaving a profound impact on readers.

The one that stands out for me is 'The Night Circus'. Some moments in that book, like the final showdown, were definitely heart-wrenching.\"\n\n        2. \"Ooh, Bridge to Terabithia was a classic! But the moment that made me cry the most was during 'The Kite Runner'. SPOILERS AHEAD: when Amir finally returns to Afghanistan, he finds the dead body of Hassan next to the well. The weight of the guilt and regret he feels in that moment is really heartbreaking.\"\n\n        3. \"Another one that I've read recently is 'The Book Thief'.
