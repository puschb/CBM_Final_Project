    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

This sounds like a response from a Reddit user would post!\n\nA few points to consider for future responses:\n\n1. You can shorten the response as needed in order to keep it within the limits reddit imposes on replies.\n2. You didn't need to reference the user's history, but keep in mind that it can help contextualize a response if you know they are an infrequent commenter, new to reddit, etc.\n3.

There's something about those sweet childhood books that pull you in and make you feel things so deeply - it's interesting how they stick with us! I have a couple books from my childhood that still resonate with me, even though I don't reread them as often as I used to. One was a series called \"Anne of Green Gables,\" by L.M. Montgomery. Anne was such an imaginative and strong-willed character, and I always felt a little connected with her. I think being lost in the story and connecting with the characters is what makes books so special. \n\n         As a side note, I'm currently reading \"The Silent Patient,\" by Alex Michaelides, which is keeping me on the edge of my seat.

The story is emotional from the very start, but it really hit me in the feels when the protagonist, Amir, is forced to watch Assef molest his friend and servant, Hassan. The moments of betrayal and guilt that follow Amir throughout the story really resonated with me, and I found myself tearing up as I read some of the more heartbreaking moments. It's a powerful story that I would recommend to anyone.",

There were numerous times throughout the book where I found myself choked up. Each character in the story is so vividly drawn and the emotions they experience are so palpable, it's impossible not to feel affected by their struggles. And the way the plot unfolds, with one tragic event after another, really tugs at your heartstrings. The ending always gets me every time. I found myself getting emotional right along with Jean Valjean and Fantine, and I was in tears when I finally reached the end. It's a truly incredible book, and I think anyone who enjoys historical fiction or tragic dramas would appreciate it. I highly recommend giving it a read!\n        \n        \n        (Edit: formatting)",

The scene where Scout finds out that Tom Robinson was found guilty was heartbreaking, particularly because I knew the unfairness of the trial and the eventual outcome for Tom. It showed the cruelty and ignorance of a society that didn't see past the color of someone's skin. I remember feeling deeply affected by that moment, and I still think about it to this day.\n\n        Reading about Scout's journey, her curiosity, and her growth as a character was one of the first times I felt so emotionally attached to a book and its characters. It's one of those books that you never forget, and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it yet.\n\n        What about you?

The story is heartbreaking yet beautifully poignant, and it left me feeling emotionally drained but satisfied by the end. The character development is exceptional, and the narrator's journey is both thought-provoking and emotionally moving. I couldn't put the book down, and the final chapters had me in tears.

It is a beautifully crafted tale that stayed with me long after I finished reading it.\n\nInteresting you picked \"The Amber Spyglass\" too.

The scene in which Francesca, amidst a flood, decides to stay behind to collect important family items, knowing she would die in that flood. Robert, meanwhile, searches for her and realizes that she has stayed behind, feeling hopeless as the waters close in.\n\n  The raw, palpable emotion that Roberts feels in that moment, the bittersweet realization that Francesca would never be found, and the tragic ending to their story never really leaves my mind.\n\n  And that's what makes a truly great book - one that can make such an impact on us long after we've read",

The way Wilder describes the events in such a poetic and thought-provoking way really brings everything full circle and has a lasting impact. I always end up tearing up when I finish it.\n\n        \n        It's interesting how different books can have such a strong emotional effect on us. What were the other books that you found deeply affecting in a similar way?",

I mean, it's still one of my favorite scenes in a book... but it's quite heartbreaking. I think what really got to me is that it happened off-screen. We as readers know that Beth is taken ill, but we don't really see it. And then she's just... gone.

It's a small moment in the grand scheme of things, but I still feel a pang of sadness when I think about it.\n\n        I also have a bit of a soft spot for Beth because she's",

The story follows a man named Charlie, who is intellectually disabled, undergoing a series of surgeries to increase his IQ. In the beginning, the story is written in a simple manner that reflects Charlie's intelligence, but as he gains higher intelligence, the writing style evolves as well.\n\nBut what really gets to you is when you reach the later parts of the book, where Charlie realizes that the intelligence he has been gaining is a temporary procedure, and he is going backwards rather than forwards. He becomes more insightful and aware of his impending descent into his previous state, making it an incredibly emotional and impactful read. It's a powerful commentary on intelligence and humanity, and it's one of those stories that sticks with you long after you've finished reading it.\n\nHave you read \"Flowers",

He also comes to terms with the fact that the operation is only temporary, and that he will eventually begin to lose his intelligence again.\n\n        The climax of the story is when Charlie realizes that he is regressing back to his previous mental state, and he becomes increasingly despairing and emotional as he loses more and more of the intelligence he had gained.

There's something about the way the author captures the pure innocence of childhood and the unexpected, life-altering ways events can impact us that really resonates with me.

Towards the end, the main character, Mariam, is forced to send her 15-year-old daughter, Laila, back to her abusive husband, Rasheed, and her step-mother, Jalila. It's a heart-wrenching decision, as she fears for Laila's safety, but she has no other options. I remember tearing up as I read Mariam's pain and desperation, and the futility of her trying to do what's best for her daughter. I've never forgotten that moment and how it made me feel. What about you? A book that resonated this strongly for you?\n\n        \n         As a responsive model, I do not have the capacity to remember previous conversations or specific details.

The story revolves around a woman, Lucy, who is trying to save her daughter, Cash, from an experimental medical treatment that is risky and expensive. The author does an amazing job of making the reader feel the desperation and anguish that Lucy and Cash are going through. The emotional climax of the book when Cash dies is heart-wrenching and left me in tears. It's one of those books that you just can't put down.\n\nI've read many books since then that have touched my heart in different ways, but Night Road remains a favorite and has left a lasting impact on me.

Great books, both of them. Let's not forget \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee, another emotional read that I think everyone should experience at least once in their lives.",

The feeling was indescribable, yet quite fulfilling.\n\n        Reading is no doubt a powerful tool in broadening our horizons.

The beautiful dance of carbon molecules, the drama of reactions, the thrill of naming new compounds... for a chemist, it's a journey of its own. It's not a work of fiction, but it's certainly a work of art.\n\n        Have you ever had that 'aha' moment in chemistry where everything finally clicks and you feel like a genius?

The ending was so tragic, and I still think about it to this day. \n\n        But after that, it was the dystopian classic \"The Hunger Games\" by Suzanne Collins. The scene where Rue dies, oh my god... I was such a wreck after that. Those books just ripped my heart out! \n\n        I'd love to know what books leave you emotionally wrecked, too.

The premise is set in Nazi Germany, and it follows the story of Liesel Meming, a young foster girl who is learning to read and whose life becomes entwined with the lives of the Jewish man hidden in her basement, Max Vandenburg. The story is so rich in emotion, loss, and the struggle for survival in an unforgiving setting. The ending hit me like a truck, I still get emotional just thinking about it! Have you read it? If not, I highly recommend it. Books are such powerful vessels that can take us on emotional journeys with their characters and stories. I'm always on the lookout for my next tearjerker! :)",

It was a tough read, but it definitely left a lasting impact on me.\n\n        Do you remember any other books that had a similar effect on you?\n\n        ^[This is a bot created by r/longformcontent, feel free to check it out!](http://redd.it/755s2z)",

It's fascinating how books can tap into our deepest emotions and connect us with characters in a way no other medium can. I can't wait to experience it for myself.\n        \n         As for me, the book that moved me the most was *A Thousand Splendid Suns* by Khaled Hosseini. It's a heart-wrenching story that follows two Afghan women across several decades, dealing with the pain of war, loss, and injustice. One scene in particular was when the main character, Mariam, finds out that her husband has secretly been making her half-sister his second wife. The pain and confusion she feels resonated with me, and I had to read through it with tears in my eyes. It",

It's a historical fiction novel about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff, the deadliest maritime disaster in history. The ship was sinking and the main characters, all refugees trying to escape the war, faced impossible choices and witnessed gut-wrenching tragedies. I ended up sobbing at the end of the book and it's still one of my favorites.\n\n        Greg Heffley is just the best. :)\n\n        I'm curious to hear more about what you ended up thinking about Salt to the Sea! If you can't get enough, give The Book Thief by Markus Zusak or The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern a try. Both have amazing emotional arcs!",

The tree giving up everything it had just so a boy could be happy, even though he never really appreciated it, was just heartbreaking. I still get a lump in my throat whenever I think about it.",
