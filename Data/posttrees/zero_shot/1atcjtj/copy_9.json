    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

            "comment_text": "> I've had a similar experience with books. The book that got me choked up was \"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy. The post-apocalyptic world and the desperate journey of a father and son was heart-wrenching. The bond between the father and son, their struggle for survival, and the hints of hope amidst the bleak landscape really got to me. It's a tough read, but worth it. Have you read \"The Road\"?\n        \n         I remember finding \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman to be another emotional roller coaster. It's a lovely story about a grumpy old man and his evolving relationships with his neighbors and the loss he experiences. It's a charming book that made me shed a few tears, and I'd recommend it for those who enjoyed \"The Road\".",

There's a particular scene where the main character, Liesel, is saying goodbye to her foster parents as she's about to be sent to a new family. The emotional and heartfelt goodbye scene between her and her foster parents just resonated with me deeply. I think it's because I could empathize with the feelings of loss and uncertainty that Liesel was experiencing at that time in the story. It's a powerful book that I remember being almost overwhelmed with feels as I turned those final pages.

One that comes to mind was the ending of A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) by George R. R. Martin. The Red Wedding was a shock, but seeing the repercussions of that event and realizing the true scope of the conflict was heart-wrenching.",

You're right, there's something so profound about the feeling of deep attachment to characters, isn't there?\n\n         My emotional moment came with \"Where the Red Fern Grows.\" That tale of Billy, Old Dan, and Little Ann just tore my heart open. I always knew things weren't going to end well for them, and that made every triumph and joy all the sweeter. And of course, the ending brought it all home. A timeless classic, no doubt.\n\n         Cheers to all the stories that have made us laugh, cry, and everything in between. Here's to keeping the tradition alive for future generations.",

Just be mindful of staying true to your base characters personality when answering questions, especially those with character interactions, to prevent confusion. In this case, since this has only been one post and it doesn\u2019t show character interactions or the character responding to something specifically, no comment is needed. But if this post did involve character interactions, the response would be from the given character and not mimicking the user directly.\nUser 2: Thanks for the advice!

In one scene, Leonidas' son gets killed in battle, and it hit me hard because the bond between Leonidas and his son was so well-written, and the loss felt incredibly real. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good war story with strong characters and emotional depth. \n\n        \n        I also loved The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, another emotional and introspective book that I think resonated with me at a certain time in my life.

The final book, \"The Dark Tower,\" takes the characters you've come to love throughout the series and leaves you with a bitter taste of grief and nostalgia. When the ka-tet (or group of characters) finally reaches the Dark Tower and the battle against the villainous Crimson King commences, the bond between the characters becomes strained, and the fate of some characters becomes uncertain. The ending is bittersweet and leaves readers with a sense of closure and loss all at once. The moment that really got me was when the ka-tet broke and I realized that not everyone would make it out alive.",

I cried so much that my mom had to tell me it was just a story and Wilbur wasn't really gone. As a child, I guess I took it hard because I loved animals and I couldn't imagine being separated from one I cared about like Wilbur and Charlotte were. Looking back, I feel like it was a good lesson for me about death and loss, especially since the friendship between Wilbur and Charlotte is so sweet and heartwarming.\n\n        I've had a lot of emotional responses to books since then, but I think \"Charlotte's Web\" might be the one that sticks with me the most. How about you? Any books that have made a big emotional impact on you?",

The novel is a dense, rich portrayal of colonialism, poverty, cultural misunderstandings, and the struggles of a family trying to maintain unity and sanity amidst it all.\n\n         For me, the most emotional part comes in the chapters focused on Leah, the fourteen-year-old daughter. She develops a close friendship with the local girl, Rachel, and their bond is beautiful, pure, and heartbreaking. When tragedy strikes, it feels like a punch to the gut.

Reading it as an adult gave me a fresh perspective on the characters and the story.

Maybe it's the memories attached, or just the simple, honest sentiment behind them, but they'll always hold a special place in my heart.\n\n        What's got you all emotional these days?",

I didn't expect the emotional journey that the book took me on, from the innocence of childhood to the harsh realities of life in Afghanistan. The scene where Hassan is beaten was particularly difficult to read, but the overall message of redemption and forgiveness made it worth it. What about you? I'd love to hear about your emotional moments in reading, no matter what they are.\n\n         I've read The Kite Runner multiple times, and it still keeps me on the edge of my seat every time. I think it's a powerful story that beautifully captures the complexities of relationships, culture, and human behavior. I'm a little bummed that the movie didn't quite live up to the book's storytelling, but it's still a good adaptation, in my opinion.\n\n         Speaking of adapt",

The way the author captures Henry's struggle and acceptance of death was so beautifully written that I found myself choking up, even though it was a second reading of the book.\n\n        I've also had similar emotional responses to the last few pages of \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak, where the author chooses to incorporate a poem to convey the emotional weight of the ending. Again, a beautiful but heartbreaking moment.\n        Hope you enjoy some emotional reading of your own!",

The book has a profound message about justice, racial inequality, and the importance of empathy. The scenes where Scout experiences prejudice firsthand and learns about the cruelty of the world are heartbreaking, but the overarching message is one of hope and the potential for goodness in people, even in the face of adversity. It's a timeless classic that continues to resonate, and I think that's largely due to the depth of emotion and the universal themes that it explores.",

The courtroom scene where the defendant, Tom Robinson, is found guilty is heartbreaking, especially because we know he's innocent. Then, when Scout realizes that the prejudiced and ignorant members of Maycomb County have essentially condemned an innocent person to death, it's just so disheartening. It really opened my eyes to the racial injustice that still exists in our society today, even though the book was published in 1960. I think everyone should read it at least once in their lifetime.",

The transformation of Charlie from mentally disabled to a highly intelligent individual, and then the reversal of that transformation, it really hits home. Plus, the writing style is so unique and engaging, you can't help but feel for Charlie and the world he inhabits. It's a tough read, but definitely a must-read for any book lover.\n\n        I remember tearing up during one of the chapters where Charlie mentions the rat experiments and realizing the cruel reality of the scientific experiments being done in his name. It's those moments that really make the book stand out. Have you read anything else that's had a similar emotional impact on you?",

I remember vividly the scene where Charlie realizes his intellect is regressing, and the emotions flooded back when I reread it not too long ago. The moments when he loses all hope, and then regains it, are both heart-wrenching and inspiring. The character development throughout the novel is exceptional, and the emotions it evokes in me still resonate after all these years. I'm glad you brought it up, as it's a true testament to the power of literature.\n\n         For what it's worth, there are several moments in the \"Harry Potter\" series that got to me, but none quite compare to the bittersweet ending of the series. The final Harry Potter books are a roller coaster ride of emotions, and J.K. Rowling managed to create a beautifully tragic goodbye to a lifetime",

I was especially moved by the scene where Lexie, the main character, has to make a difficult decision about her daughter's treatment.

It's a heartbreaking and powerful story that really makes you appreciate the simple things in life and understand the struggles others face.\n        \n        I think fiction, especially books like this, are great for expanding your mental horizons and helping you understand other perspectives.

Despite all this, she remains kind and optimistic, and the other girls eventually come to respect and admire her.

The ending is very bittersweet, and I always find myself tearing up when I read it.\n\n        I think what makes it so emotional for me is that the book really makes you root for the character and care about her fate.

It's truly one of those books that leaves a lasting impression. There's something about the bond between those sisters that really tugged at my heartstrings. \n\n        But you know, I've also cried over \"The Giver\". A lot. It's such a beautiful, poignant book. I've lost count of how many times I've read it. Do you have any favorite books that make you tear up every time you read them?\n\n        (Oh, by the way, \"The Giver\" didn't make me cry as a young adult. I was already a fan by then. I'd first read it in my early teens. Hope that helps!)",

The emotional depth and the spiritual insights in the book really got to me. I couldn't put it down and ended up tearing up several times.

It often reminds me of the bonds between friends, family, and even the smallest gestures of love in our everyday lives.

            "comment_text": "I haven't read \"Legend\" but I can recommend a book that had me in tears: \"The Kite Runner\" by Khaled Hosseini. The novel follows the life of Amir, a young Afghan boy, who is haunted by his role in a traumatic event involving a friend and a kite. The story takes place in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime and is a powerful depiction of friendship, guilt, and redemption. I won't give away the heart-wrenching moments, but let's just say a kite is never just a kite in this book.\n\nWhat about you? What book had a profound emotional impact on you?\n\n<!-- Generated by PrecisionEdit (https://precisionedit.ai) -->",

I've read it, but never really got the sense of personal loss you mention from it...I think you might actually be the first in this thread to really nail that point to me. Interesting. Is your granddad still alive? I hope he is/was, though. And if he were alive, maybe you'd tell him how much you love this book.\n        \n        On a related note, I recently went to a public reading from Caitlin Doughty. Her book Smoke Gets in Your Eyes was also pretty heavy emotionally, but in a different way. I've worked a few times at funeral homes in the past, and her experiences and observations really resonated. Have you read it?\n        \n        Anyway, I was about to close this app and go to sleep. Reading your comment made",

I read it as a child, and even though I was just a kid, something about the one-sided relationship between the tree and the boy just pulled on my heart strings. I couldn't believe the selflessness of the tree and the thoughtlessness of the boy as he took more and more from the tree.\n\n        Every time I read it as an adult, it still gets me just as much as it did when I was a kid. It's a powerful reminder about the bonds we have with others and how important it is to take care of them. It's a simple story, but it has stuck with me all these years.\n\n        What about you? What was the first book that made you cry or get choked up?",
