The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

Their story is quite reminiscent of \"Heart of Darkness\" with Marlowe's encounters in the Congo. But, let's face it, the cannibalism part is definitely a tough pill to swallow.\n\nAs for myself, I'd have to say that the first book to have ever brought a tear to my non-scary old eyes was Tolkien's \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\" The bittersweet ending of the Council of Elrond had me reaching for a tissue. Elrond's speech about the loss of the Ring and the impending doom of the Middle Earth was a punch to the gut. The world will never be the same, and I can still feel",

It was the vivid and raw portrayal of Scout's relationship with Atticus that really got me. Her innocence and the pain from learning about the world was both heartbreaking and profound for me. I still find myself revisiting that book, and it touches me just as deeply now. \ud83d\ude0a",

I've read A Prayer for Owen Meany too, and while I didn't cry as much as you did, I can definitely understand how moving that ending can be. It's a beautiful novel with memorable characters and a unique perspective that stands out in the literature world. Have you read any other books by John Irving? I find his writing style to be captivating and engaging, with a dose of humor that adds to the overall feel of the story. If you have, I'd love to hear about your favorite John Irving book, and if you haven't, I highly recommend giving him a try if you haven't already!\n\n         And as for me, I remember feeling truly invested in The Catcher in the Rye by J.D.

It's funny how we sometimes seek out nostalgia in our choices of books.\n\n         If you're ever in the mood for a more modern one, do check out \"The Night Circus\" by Erin Morgenstern.

It's a touching story that stays with you long after you've finished reading it.\n\n        P.S. I've always thought of Percy Jackson as a series on par with the Drenai Saga! Can't wait to hear which books have touched your heart in this emotional reading journey we all share! :)",

When Ghost nuzzles his face and Jon asks if it's going to be okay, my heart always breaks a little every time. It's not so much about the plot as it is the raw honesty and vulnerability in Jon's character.\n\n         Books can be so powerful in evoking emotions, and that scene in particular has stayed with me since I first read it. I'd love to hear about your favorite emotional scenes from books as well!\n\n         -Posted by /u/YourUsername4ever",

I can't say I've reached the level of weeping with a book as I did with \"Legend,\" but I'd have to say my emotional epiphany came from \"The Dark Tower\" series by Stephen King.\n\n        The series is a sprawling, complex epic that spans multiple realities, blending elements of western, fantasy, horror, and science fiction. The main character, Roland Deschain, is a gunslinger on a quest to find the Dark Tower, a mystical structure that holds the universe together.\n\n        It's toward the end of the series when we find out that Roland, who has been depicted as stoic and seemingly impervious to emotion, has a wife and child waiting for him at the end of this quest. This revelation hits hard, and as we reach the climactic final book, it becomes clear",

I remember being emotionally invested in the characters and crying at the ending, even though it was inevitable due to the premise of the story. The story is set during World War II in Nazi Germany and follows a young girl named Liesel who is forced to live with a foster family after her mother is taken away. Liesel becomes fascinated with books, and the narrative follows her journey and growth as she learns to read and then, later, to write. The book explores themes of love, family, loss, and the power of words, and the ending is particularly poignant. I remember feeling a sense of sadness and loss even after I finished the book, which is always a sign that a book has really affected me.\n\n        On a side note, another book that made me cry was \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee.",

The main character, a young girl named Liesel, steals books and learns to read while hiding from the Nazis. The book is narrated by Death itself, which gives it a unique perspective. One moment that really stands out for me is when Liesel is reading a book aloud to a group of people, and as she gets to the end of the passage, everyone gets silent and just starts crying.

On the other hand, I've also read \"Love You Forever\" and cried even harder because it's about a mother's love for her child, and the cyclical nature of parental love and obligation. The repeated sequence in the book reminds you of the phases of a child's life and really draws you in.",

As a dog lover, the bond between the main character Enzo and his owner Denny was so heartwarming that when the inevitable happened, it was really tough to read. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it, but it's a great book with a unique perspective and lots of emotion. It's certainly one I'll remember for a long time.\n\n         On my book club's next meeting, I'll be suggesting we read \"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn. I've heard it's a fantastic thriller with a great twist at the end! Perhaps it won't make me cry like \"The Art of Racing in the Rain,\" but I'm sure it'll keep me on the edge of my seat!",

The ending was so heartbreaking, but the book was a wonderful tribute to the bond between humans and their pets.

The scene in which Jamie, who is terminally ill, unexpectedly passes away is particularly heart-wrenching. It was the first book that made me cry and stay up until the wee hours of the morning to finish it. \n\nThe way the characters' personalities were developed and their emotional arcs were masterfully done.

The way it depicts the character's journey, from his initial intellectually disabled state to his sudden rise in intelligence, only to eventually come back down after the surgery wears off, was just gut-wrenching. I think what really got me was how the story mirrors the fragility of human intelligence and the constant fear of decline that comes with it. The end, where Charlie realizes the procedures were reversed and he's losing his intelligence again, was definitely a tear-jerker.

It was a powerful book that explored the life of a man named Charlie, who was intellectually disabled. He undergoes an experimental surgery that supposedly enhances his intelligence, and the story chronicles his journey as he goes from being a simple-minded individual to a brilliant, articulate man. But there's a tragic twist at the end that makes it all the more heartbreaking. I found myself really rooting for Charlie throughout the book, and I think the way the author portrays his character's struggles and triumphs is incredibly well done. It definitely left an emotional impact on me. When I reached the final chapters, I couldn't help but feel a lump form in my throat. Definitely worth a read if you haven't yet.",

I remember sitting in my friend's basement when we were in high school, losing myself in the books, and being totally oblivious to the time passing.

It's kinda weird to cry over a character in a series like that, but I guess that goes to show how invested I was in the story. What about you? Did you have any emotional moments that really stuck with you from a series you've read?",

I actually read the Harry Potter series as a younger kid, so its emotional beats maybe didn't have much impact on me at the time. But since I re-read the series, I can see the weight of that moment. The series was such a huge part of my childhood, and >!Dumbledore!< held a special place in my heart. He was the wise, guiding figure who always seemed to know the right thing to say or do. So when he died, it felt like a part of my childhood was gone too. It's a bittersweet memory, but I'm glad I got to revisit that series as an adult and feel those emotions again. What about you?

I remember seeing the movie when I was younger and being completely enchanted by it. But, alas, I never picked up the book.\n\nI think the first book that really made me cry was \"The NeverEnding Story\" by Michael Ende. I remember reading it during a school camp trip, and being so absorbed in the story that I stayed up late into the night to finish it. When the main character, Bastian, is reading the book at the end, and the Nothing is destroying Fantastica, I couldn't help but feel a lump in my throat.\n\nIt was such a visceral experience. I suppose I just connected with the character and the magic of the story in a way that really touched me. It's definitely a book I'll keep close to my heart.",

It's the story of a young woman, Lucy, who is an excellent doctor, but she makes a terrible mistake that changes her life forever.\n\nThe narrative flips back and forth between the past and the present, and the tension builds as you learn about Lucy's past, about her mistakes, her regrets, and her love for her family. It's heart-wrenching, to say the least.\n\nThe climax of the story, where everything comes to a head and you can feel your emotions boiling up, is something I won't soon forget. It's a powerful book, and one that I think anyone who loves well-written, emotionally charged fiction should read.\n\nWhat about you?

I still think about those greasers and the events from their lives, and it's so sad to realize that the things that happened to them might have happened in real life back then. The way Hinton portrayed the camaraderie, love, and friendship among the boys just shines through and is so real in its portrayal, it's a true shame about the tragic ending, but it makes you appreciate both the beauty and the fragility of life. Glad to know others share this emotional experience as well. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\u2694\ufe0f\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f \ud83d\udc9e\nUser 2: This one's perfect man.

It's always interesting to read a story that challenges conventional happy endings and makes you really feel for the characters.\n\n        In terms of my own emotional moments in books, another one that comes to mind is \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak. The book tells the story of a young girl named Liesel who is sent to live with foster parents in Nazi Germany. It's a heartbreaking book that highlights the horrors of this time period, but also manages to show the beauty and power of words.

I remember enjoying David Gemmell's \"Stormrider\" series though, despite some friends in a book club not loving it. As for a book that got me choked up, I'd have to say \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak. It's a beautiful, heart-wrenching story about a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany. The prose is so lyrical and the characters so endearing that I found myself shedding tears throughout the book, especially at the ending. I highly recommend it if you haven't read it yet.",

For me, there have been two books that left me quite choked up. The first was Night by Elie Wiesel, which is a memoir of Wiesel's experiences as a Holocaust survivor. It was incredibly powerful to read about the horrors that he and so many others endured, and I remember being utterly shocked and heartbroken by the end. The giving Tree is another one that always gets me. I think it's because of the profound and selfless love that the tree displays towards the boy, and the reminder it gives us about the importance of giving and not expecting anything in return. Reading it always makes me feel a bit melancholy, but in a good way. What about you? Have you read Night or The giving Tree and if so, what did you think of them? Or",

Martin, specifically the first book, \"A Game of Thrones.\" It's a high fantasy epic that explores themes of power, loyalty, and survival in a dangerous and chaotic world.

The emotional arc is what did it for me -- I ended up really caring about the characters, and experiencing strong reactions to their plights.\n\n  I think one thing about books is that they often do have a way of becoming like old friends and that rereading them can be a comfort. They can provide you with the escape you need, especially when the real world is stressful. And sometimes, they can even touch a nerve and bring up old memories and feelings like the one you mentioned.\n\n  In my case, I would have to say that Watergate Down had a similar impact at the time I read it.

At least that appears to be his goal.\n\nBut for me, it was David Gemmell's \"Legend\" that got me choked up. The story of Druss and his wife was a rollercoaster of emotions, and I couldn't put the book down. It was the first time I felt so invested in a book's characters and their story. How about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.",

The Glass Bead Game by Hermann Hesse is such a beautiful book, with moments that really linger in the mind. I can see why it would affect you so much, especially with the death of the protagonist's teacher. In fact, it struck a chord with me too, as I remember feeling a strange sense of peace when reading about it for the first time. It's a unique feeling that this book brings out, one that I don't see in many other novels. It seems like we both share the love for this book. I'd love to read or discuss more books that have resonated so deeply with us, if you have any suggestions.",

The friendship between Leslie and Jessie, and the tragic ending left me in floods of tears. It's a book that I feel everyone should read, it teaches valuable lessons about friendship, loss, and acceptance. It's a real shame that it's sometimes overlooked when discussing impactful books.",

It seems so simple, but the message and emotions behind those pages are truly powerful. The tree giving away her strength, her trunk, and eventually her very life to help the boy with whatever he needed, even when he forgot or ignored her needs... It just hits home for me. I remember reading it as a kid, and it left a lasting impression.\n\n        \n        But it wasn't until much later, when I re-read it as an adult, that I truly understood the depth of the story. I mean, think about it, if the tree, in its old age, could go back in time, wouldn't she have done things differently? Wouldn't she have set some boundaries or perhaps asked for something in return? But alas, she loved the boy and saw him as her reason to exist.\n\n        \n        I",
