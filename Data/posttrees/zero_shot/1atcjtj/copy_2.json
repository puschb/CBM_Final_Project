    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

            "comment_text": "> I love the Dr. Bronner bottles and Ezekiel bread labels. But when it comes to books, those labels are nothing compared to the heart-wrenching feels I got from reading Stephen King's \"The Stand.\" Spoiler: I don't want to give too much away, but there's a scene involving a young girl and a pit of rats that still haunts me. And let's not forget the hauntingly beautiful lyrics of \"All Along the Watchtower\" at the end. That book was another one I just couldn't put down, too absorbed in the story to care about crying. What about you? Do you have any emotionally charged reading moments?",

I can understand how a heartfelt, deeply emotional story could bring on the tears. I remember the first time I connected with a book on an emotional level - it was the Drenai Saga by David Gemmell, and the book I mentioned earlier, Legend. I couldn't put it down and found myself welling up at various points.\n\n        If you enjoy tales that can bring out strong emotions, I think you might appreciate another David Gemmell series, the Troy trilogy. It's a reimagining of the Trojan War, and though it's an epic tale of war, you'll still find a lot of poignant moments that might bring a tear to your eye. Hope you give it a read and enjoy!\n\n        Thanks for sharing",

It's that moment when all the tension and heartache that built up throughout the book comes crashing down, and it never fails to make me emotional.\n\n        On another note, have you ever considered reading The Road? It's a heavy, scary read, but I found it thought-provoking. After reading it, I felt a sense of nausea, but I'm glad I went through the experience.

It was from a series called The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis, specifically the book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. There's a scene where Aslan, the lion and symbol of Christ, is sacrificed, and for some reason, that scene left a deep impression on my young mind. No book has ever made me cry as much as that one did. But maybe when I grow up, I'll find something that'll top it. It's interesting to hear about the books that have moved others, and I'd love to know more about your emotional reading experiences too!",

The story had a profound impact on me, not just because it was sad, but because it was about friendship and loyalty, and how important those things can be in our lives. It's been years since I've read it, but it's still one of those stories that I remember vividly, and still think about every now and then. It left a mark on me for sure, and I can see why it would for others too. Hearing about someone else's emotional moment in a book always makes me feel a bit nostalgic. What about you? Do",

My heart might as well have been ripped out of my chest while I read that one. The poignant depiction of their ill-fated love story left me a sobbing mess.\n\n        I'll admit, I teared up reading \"The Giver\" too, when Jonas was experiencing the memories of the past.

The scene that always gets me is when Susannah is pregnant with Mordred and she begs them to end it all to prevent Mordred from being born.

            "comment_text": "One of the most emotional for me was \"A Farewell to Arms\" by Ernest Hemingway. It's an epic romance set against the backdrop of World War I and the main character, Frederic Henry, is a medical officer trying to hold it together, both personally and militarily. There's a tragic scene during a skirmish where he and his lover, Catherine, are hiding from shelling. He's wounded and tries to get her to safety, and she gets too close and is hit by a shell. I really had a hard time reading that part. It was just so heart-wrenching and poignant... I actually started to cry as I was reading it in the metro, much to the strangers around me's bewilderment. Have you read it? I definitely recommend it. It's a classic for a reason.",

I got so into it that I ended up finishing all the books in one go. It ruined my sleep schedule for weeks but I'd do it again!\n\n        As for other emotional moments in books, my heart also got wrenched in the original \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" and that scene where Valentine Michael Smith is reunited with his lost love.

I read \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" for the first time a few years ago, and that courtroom scene really hit me. I know it's not exactly a spoiler because it's famous, but man, I was still shook up by it. It's amazing how much an imagined scenario can touch you, even though you know it's not real. It's definitely worth a read if you haven't done so already.\n        \n        In terms of a book that gave me the feels, \"The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet\" by Becky Chambers was such a sweet story. I loved every single character, from the crew of the spaceship Wayfarer to the various alien races they encountered. As someone who grew up on science fiction",

I've heard great things about Marley and Me, and it's definitely a sentimental pick for choosing a book that resonated deeply with you. That must have been a rough time, but it sounds like you had the support of your grandma to help you through it.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had a dog named Rusty. We lost him when I was about the same age as you were when you read Marley and Me. It took me a while to find a dog that felt like Rusty, but when I did, she was just as awesome as my ol' buddy. The love a dog can bring to a family is immeasurable, and I'm glad it's part of my life again.\n\nThanks for sharing your story! I'd love to hear about the books that have impacted your life over time. Maybe next time ;)",

My all-time favorite though would have to be The Death of Ivan Ilyich by Leo Tolstoy. It's a short novella and it packs an emotional punch unlike anything else I've ever read. It's not so much about the characters crying or getting emotional, but more so about the realization of one's mortality and the futility of it all. It's a sobering read that leaves you with a lingering sense of existential dread. Definitely worth a read!\n\n        \n        But enough about me, what's your pick for a book that made you feel emotional? I'm curious to hear about it.",

The way Gaiman intertwines the mythology and folklore of various cultures into a beautifully crafted story is always captivating, but the emotional journey of Bod and the other characters was something special. The moment that stood out to me the most was when Bod was at the funeral of his adoptive family. The poignancy of the scene and the depth of emotion felt really resonated with me. It reminded me of the bittersweetness of endings and the poignant beauty of beginnings, all captured beautifully in Gaiman's prose. What emotional reading experiences have you had?",

It's not the first book that has moved me to tears, as I recall that \"Legend\" by David Gemmell left me in a similar state. The raw emotion and heartbreaking moments in that tale, especially the reunion between Druss and his beloved, truly resonated with me. I still remember the feeling it left me with, so I can appreciate the impact of a good story on our emotions. It seems your experience with Hunger Games had a similar effect on you, especially with the death of the important character related to Katniss. I'll certainly look forward to reading the series someday. What are your other favorite books that moved you in such a manner?",

There's a scene where Dmitri Karamazov weeps at the train station, and it was so raw and emotional that I found myself shedding tears, too. But it wasn't just about the characters' emotions; I think it was the profound themes and the depth to which Tolstoy explores human nature that resonated with me.

The story of Charlie, a mentally disabled man who undergoes a medical procedure to increase his intelligence, is heartbreaking because of the way the story unfolds. As Charlie's intelligence increases, he starts to realize more and more about the world and his own life. However, as the story progresses, it becomes evident that the procedure has a limited lifespan, and eventually, Charlie's intelligence starts to decline again. It's a poignant read that really makes you think about the limitations of science, humanity, and intelligence.

The story revolves around a grumpy old man who has lost his wife and is struggling to connect with his new neighbors, and I found myself becoming more invested in the main character and his growth throughout the story. There was a scene towards the end where Ove encounters a friend from his past, and their interaction was very poignant and hit me hard emotionally. I'd love to hear about any books that have had a similar effect on you!\n        \n         For me, I find that fiction helps me gain a deeper understanding of human emotions, which is something that translates to real life as well.

It starts off with White Fang being taken out from the wild and taught to be cruel to survive, but by the end, a man named Kurt (and his sled dogs) saves him and he becomes the opposite of how he was treated by the two-legged beasts before. This book made me bawl like a baby as a kid, but it's been a lot of years since then. Now it's more reminiscing than actually sobbing.

The mixture turned a beautiful deep purple color, and the final precipitate was a crystal-clear, odorless, and tasteless white solid \u2013 aspirin. \n\n        It was the first time I understood the real-world impact of chemistry on my life, and the potential it had in shaping the future. The feelings it stirred in me were akin to a passionate first love or the sense of homecoming after a long journey. I think that's what books can do \u2013 paint vivid images and let you experience different worlds.\n\n        I'm curious to know if any other fellow science enthusiasts had a similar emotional moment related to a tome",

I mean, it was like watching a beautiful dance, with the nucleophile and electrophile gently waltzing towards a covalent bond, leaving carboxylate ions and triphenylmethyl cations in their wake. I know, it's a weird place to feel a connection, but this textbook just seemed to resonate with me on a level I didn't know was possible. I guess that's the magic of chemistry, huh?

She becomes the hero we root for, the one who stands up against tyranny and oppression. However, in a twist of fate, Vin is forced to make a decision that leads to the death of someone she deeply cares for, and it left me a mess.

Ove, the main character, is a grumpy old man who has lost his wife and is struggling to adjust to life without her. He's stubborn, set in his ways, and a bit harsh, but gradually we see the softer, more vulnerable side of him.\n\n        The book is filled with small moments that make you laugh, cry, and everything in between. For me, it was the scene where Ove gets a flat tire. This wasn't a tragic event, but it was how the entire neighborhood came together to help him that really made me feel emotional.\n\n        It's a book that reminds you of the importance of community, friendship, and love",

I had read it for a high-school assignment, and I was not a big fan of the classics at the time. I can't remember exactly what chapter it was, but I remember bursting into tears in the public library where I was reading. Something about the tragic romance between Sydney Carton and Lucie Manette really got to me, I suppose because it was so hopelessly romantic and doomed from the start. I think I also connected to the themes of sacrifice, love, and redemption in the story. It made me realize that there was more to literature than the boring textbooks I had been assigned. \n\nAnyone else have a book that made them cry for unanticipated reasons?",

The part where Santiago finally achieves his personal legend and embraces the Soul of the World was particularly moving for me. It reminds me that no matter how difficult things may seem, it's important to keep following your dreams even if it feels scary and uncertain. Maybe that will help you too, anxious reader.

But as the story unfolds, we learn about his past and the losses he's suffered, which make him seem a little more human. In the end, he finally opens up and lets people into his life, and it's just a beautiful moment that gets me every time.

The tree's selflessness and endless generosity made me tear up each time I read it, even as an adult.\n        \n        \n        The moments of the little boy enjoying the fruit from the tree, getting a swing, building a house, and finally chopping it down to make a boat all feel so deeply personal. It's a poignant reminder of the stages of life and those we hold dear, even if they suffer for our happiness.\n        \n        \n        I'd love to hear about your emotionally moving stories!",
