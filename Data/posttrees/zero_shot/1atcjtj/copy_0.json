    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

I've always been a fan of John Irving's writing, and I often find myself emotionally invested in his stories. I can only imagine the heart-wrenching moments in that book that made you cry so much. Books have a way of doing that to us, don't they? They transport us into these intricate worlds and make us feel deeply connected to the characters. Perhaps that's why they're such an important part of our lives.",

I completely agree with you about \"A Prayer for Owen Meany,\" that's one book that has been very influential for me too. I also sobbed tremendously during the last 50 pages, especially when the main character, John Wheelwright, and his friend, Owen Meany, had that fateful moment with the canon. It was just heartbreaking, and it's a perfect example of how well John Irving can write emotional yet unique stories! It was also a bittersweet journey reading that book, considering the parallels between Owen's life and the real-life events of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Have you read any of his other works, such as \"A Widow for One Year\"? Another incredible read!",

One is **Rebecca** by Daphne du Maurier, and the other is **Franny and Zooey** by J.D. Salinger. The former, with all its Gothic trappings, still sends a shiver down my spine. The latter, with its exploration of faith and family, is deeply moving and makes me question my life choices",

The book really emphasized the bond between humans and animals, and it's a beautiful and emotional read.\n\n         There are other books that have moved me as well, but this one will always hold a special place in my heart.",

It's one of those moments where you know the story is reaching its climax, and the weight of it all just comes crashing down. Such a fantastic series overall, and that moment really stood out to me.

But it's hard to know how much of my current views on death are the result of my upbringing and how much are just a natural part of growing up.\n       \n        It's interesting to think about, though. Thanks for asking!\n       \n        \n        By the way, speaking of death, haven't read \"Legend\" by David Gemmell yet. Might give it a try. I have a tendency to avoid high fantasy since it's so time-consuming, but this",

You start off invested in the story or the character, and before you realize it, you just can't stop reading until you reach that emotional climax. It's a strange form of escape, isn't it? Maybe it's time to revisit some of those books that had such a profound effect on us!\n\n        \n        For what it's worth, I went back to Where the Red Fern Grows a few years ago and found it just as powerful and moving as I did as a kid.

David Gemmell - his prose is akin to a symphony, building steadily to crescendo with a touch that's both brutal and heartwarming. His book, Legend, did just that for me - it left me teary-eyed on several occasions.",

Years ago, I discovered Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series, and the first book, \"The Final Empire,\" left a lasting impression on me.\n\n         The premise of the story revolves around a young woman, Vin, who is a slave in the oppressive, dystopian landscape of the Final Empire. She has a rare ability called Allomancy, which allows her to burn metals to accomplish feats beyond normal human capabilities.\n\n         Throughout the book, Vin navigates a complex world filled with treachery, deception, and power struggles among the ruling aristocrats. And while the action was captivating, what truly moved me was Vin's character development. Watching her struggle to come to terms with her newfound abilities and grapple with her growing inner strength was incredibly inspirational.",

I remember reading \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" by Audrey Niffenegger and just being so completely swept up in the romance and emotion of it. When the main character, Henry, dies towards the end, I was in tears for several days. It was a real rollercoaster of emotions, and it's still one of my favorite reads of all time.\n\n        \n        On a related note, I have a real pet peeve when people start talking about or spoil books for me before I've had a chance to read them. It completely ruins the experience for me, and I end up not enjoying the book nearly as much as I could have. So I try to be very careful about that myself. (Might be why I had a hard time picking up \"Legend\" since I heard it had a bit of that!)",

Goblet of Fire was indeed emotional, specifically considering the death of Cedric Diggory. The emotion was amplified by the fact that, as someone similar to Cedric was in my life at that time, which made reading that part even tougher. Do you remember which part of the story moved you the most in either of these books? For me, it was the aftermath of the death in Goblet of Fire, Harry's relationship with his friends and teachers, and the pain they all endured.",

The scene where he writes \"Charlie was a fool to think anything could change\" is particularly poignant. It's a stark reminder of the fleeting nature of progress and the human condition. \n\n        I also found the book poignant because it is such a rare depiction of intellectual disability and the struggle for self-discovery and independence that many people with learning difficulties face.

I, on the other hand, found a surprising emotional resonance in a novel that, at first glance, might seem quite unrelated to your choice. \n\n       Jodi Picoult's \"My Sister's Keeper\" was the book that left me wiping away tears, not necessarily from the plot itself, but from an epiphany it sparked within me. The story centers around a family dealing with a young girl's leukemia and the ethical dilemmas surrounding her treatment. Part of what touched me was the exploration of complex questions about humanity, life, and the moral choices we make when faced with difficult circumstances. Perhaps it's the fact that, as you mentioned, fiction can broaden our perspectives and challenge our beliefs, even if it doesn't occur in the exact situation we may face",

A few things to note:\n\n1) The user appears to be a novelist, hence the reference to being published.\n\n2) The user does seem to read a lot and comment on books on Reddit so it's very likely they read The Outsiders.\n\n3) The user's comment history is only one short comment so we can't infer too much from it.\n\nSo I'd say the response was mostly accurate and likely on point but we are making assumptions to simplify the information",

I was hooked from the moment I picked it up in grade school and couldn\u2019t believe how exciting and fast paced it was. But what really got me was the character development. I loved seeing Percy grow and change through the books, but the real turning point for me was Book 3, The Titan\u2019s Curse. There was a particular character, Nico di Angelo, who I had been anticipating his introduction in the series. When he finally showed up, we found out that he had lost everyone he loved, and I couldn\u2019t imagine the pain and grief he had experienced. The author did an incredible job of capturing his emotions and making me feel it too. I was devastated when his beloved cousin, Bianca, didn\u2019t survive a battle, and it stayed with me for a long time",

It's such a poignant reminder of the fragility of dreams and the harsh realities of life, especially during the Great Depression. Steinbeck really knows how to tug at the heartstrings with his storytelling. Do you have any favorite Steinbeck novels?\nUser 3: Ah, \u201cLegend\u201d, I read that a couple of years back. I\u2019d have to agree that was definitely one of the most emotional books I\u2019ve ever read, especially the ending. It had me choking up for days after finishing it.\n\nAs for Steinbeck, I\u2019d say \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d does indeed have a special place in my heart. It\u2019s beautifully crafted, powerful, and very moving. Other favorite Steinbeck books of mine include \u201c",

Sparrowhawk, or Ged, has a humble beginning, but his magic grows as he learns more. However, he also attracts dark forces that threaten to consume him.\n\n        The scene that got me, and still does, is when Ged is faced with the shadow of his own self, the shadows of the dead, and the darkness of his own magic. The imagery is haunting and the tension builds up slowly, making it all the more powerful when he finally seizes control.\n\n        I'm glad to hear about your emotional moments in reading. What was the book that left you the most impacted?",

As I've grown older, I've come to appreciate the novel even more, and I'm always eager to reread it. It's a timeless classic.\n\n        \n        What about you?

The story is set during World War II in Germany and follows a young girl named Liesel who is fostered by a family in Munich. She is gifted with a deep love of books and the story weaves a powerful tale of the human spirit during one of the darkest times in history.\n\n        \n        There are several moments throughout the book where I felt incredibly emotional, but the one that really stands out to me is a spoiler, so I won't give it away here.

            "comment_text": "\ud83d\udcda The first book to make me tear up was The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. Despite being a quick, easy read, the book hit me hard. There's a certain scene where the protagonist, Santiago, is on his journey to find his treasure or true destiny, and he comes to a place where he sees a vast, deep forest in front of him. He feels overwhelmed and scared, unsure if he should continue on his path. In that moment, I felt the same way as Santiago - uncertain, but with a desperate determination to push forward. And I found myself with teary eyes, willing Santiago to take the next step, to embark on this journey with him. I guess you could say that the book resonated with me on a deep level, making me feel a strong connection to its main character. \n\n        \ud83d\udcda Another book that got me choked up was The Book Thief by Markus Z",

I'll have to make sure to read it when I can, as I think it's definitely one that would resonate with me.\n\n         For me, it was also a book that deeply affected me: \"The Giver\" by Lois Lowry. This was because of the intense emotion portrayed in the story as well as the difficult themes it addresses, like the understanding of a society based on the repression of emotions and the brutal suppression of individuality. It made me cry not just once, but several times throughout the book, and I'll never forget the profound impact it had on me.\n\n         Is there another book that, like \"Legend\", resonated with you because of its intensity and emotional impact? It's fascinating to learn about others' experiences through literature.",

There were definitely a few times where I had to take a break and wipe my eyes.\n\n         The story revolves around Ove, a grumpy old man who seems to have given up on life. But as the story unfolds, you slowly see his humanity. He's been through so much, from military service to the loss of his wife, and it all builds up.\n\n         The part that really got me was when he meets his next-door neighbors, who help him in ways he never expected. Seeing him open up and connect with others was truly moving.\n\n         I think we all have books that make us feel something a little deeper.

That book hit me HARD and it's crazy how it's been years since I've read it but I still remember the feelings it caused! My heart goes out to anyone who has had to lose a dear furry friend. The pain of such a loss can be incomparable. But it's also a reminder of the love and joy they brought into our lives, which makes the loss all the more profound. I think about them and smile, knowing they're up in doggy heaven with a big field of red ferns to play in.",
