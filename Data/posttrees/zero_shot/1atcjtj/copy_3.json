    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

The Drenai Saga series by David Gemmell is a gem, and reading \"Legend\" was truly an emotional roller coaster. The connection between Druss and his wife is so raw and heartbreaking that it still resonates with me to this day.\n\nAs for books that have moved me to tears, I'd have to say that \"All the Pretty Horses\" by Cormac McCarthy left an indelible mark on me. There's something about this novel's depiction of the harsh, unforgiving landscape and the resilience of the characters that just hits close to home. The characters' struggles and their sense of purpose really get under your skin and stay with you long after you've turned the last page.\n\nGive \"All the Pretty Horses\" a read, and let me know if it chokes",

The relationship they developed and the emotions they shared left a deep impact on me.\n\n        Second, Cider House Rules, also by John Irving.

The themes of love, sacrifice, and morality in the novel will always remain close to me.\n\n        I hope",

There's a book I tried reading a couple of times but couldn't finish because it was too raw. \"The Giver\" by Lois Lowry has a profound impact on me. It's a dystopian novel about a society where emotions are suppressed, and the protagonist is chosen to be the receiver of all of humanity's history and emotions. The ending, where he has to make a tough decision, never fails to leave me in tears. It's a testament to the author's skill in pulling the emotional strings.",

Reading books that evoke strong emotions, whether it's sadness or happiness, is one of the best parts of being a reader. For me, it was really unexpected:\n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book, his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved.\n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling",

It's a Caldecott Honor Book that tells the story of a little boy who loses a mitten in the snowy forest and then a series of small animals find it and cozy up in it, unintentionally creating a trail of \"snow shoes.\"\n        \n        It sounds like a great childhood book, and I can see why it might make anyone cry, especially when I remember the image of a boy sobbing because his mitten fell out of his hands when he was going to retrieve it from the frozen lake. I've never read the book myself, but I can imagine how it might evoke strong emotions in a young child, especially when combined with the themes of death and grieving in the story.\n        \n        Dumbo is another classic book that can be really emotional, especially the scene where Dumbo is separated",

The emotional weight and depth of that story resonated with me in a way few other books had, and it remains one of my all-time favorites.

For myself, it was the Drenai Saga's \"Legend\" that really got to me with its emotional storytelling and strong characters. Have you read anything else that has had a similar effect on you? I'm always looking for new recommendations.",

Whether it's the selflessness of the tree or the overwhelming love between mother and child, those books just have something special and magical that still bring tears to my eyes whenever I read them. The bond between the young boy and the tree in *The Giving Tree* and the unyielding love in *Love You Forever* are things I wish I could experience myself, and it's that profound feeling of connection that makes them truly memorable.\n\n        Now that I'm older, I've moved on to other books that touch my heart in different ways, but those two remain my all-time favorite emotionally moving tales. What's yours? I'd love to hear about your emotional experiences while reading.",

The tale of two magicians, Prospero and Marco, and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Celia and Marco, the book is a beautiful, enchanting, and captivating story about love, magic, and sacrifice.\n\nThe emotional crux of the book comes near the end, when things take a dark turn. I won't spoil it, but let's just say it was a gut punch. I remember being so drawn into the story that I felt heartbroken when things didn't go as I had hoped. It was a powerful moment that left me thinking about the book long after I turned the final page.\n\nThat being said, I'd love to hear about your emotional moments reading, no matter what they are.

            "comment_text": "I've had my fair share of emotional reads, but one that immediately comes to mind is \"The Poisonwood Bible\" by Barbara Kingsolver. It's a multigenerational saga that follows the Price family as they navigate colonialism in the Belgian Congo in the mid-1900s. The book is heart-wrenching, beautifully written, and full of raw emotion.\n\n        The main character, Orleanna Price, is a complex and compelling narrator, and her relationship with her husband Nathan is fraught with misunderstanding, tension, and eventual emotional breakdown. The book's climax, where Orleanna confronts Nathan about his harmful actions, is a powerful and emotional moment that left me in tears.\n\n        I'd highly recommend \"The Poisonwood Bible\" to anyone looking for a rich, historical, and emotionally impactful read. It's one of those books that stays",

I read it a few years ago, and it follows the lives of a group of college baseball players, particularly their pitcher, Henry, and the school's star shortstop, Owen, who is also Henry's roommate and best friend. The novel is very much a coming-of-age story, and it explores themes of love, loss, friendship, and growing up.\n\n        One scene in particular that got to me was towards the end of the book, when Owen is in the hospital after getting into a terrible car accident. Henry visits him, and Owen is unconscious. Henry realizes that he's in love with Owen, but he's afraid to tell him because he thinks Owen might not feel the same way. After a while, Owen wakes up, and Henry finally tells him about his feelings. Owen is quiet for a moment",

            "comment_text": "The first book that made me cry was \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman. The story follows a grumpy, old widower who has given up on life. Despite his gruff exterior, Ove is a kind, sensitive soul with a heart full of love and memories of his late wife.\n\n        Towards the end of the book, there is a moment where Ove confronts his old friend who was the driving force behind his wife's accidental death. The build-up to this confrontation is heavy with tension, and the resolution is both heart-wrenching and cathartic.\n\n        The book's exploration of friendship, loss, forgiveness, and second chances resonated deep within me and left me in tears for days. There are so many powerful moments in the book, but that particular confrontation will always stand out as the most emotional for me.\nUser 2: Nice answer!",

Now we're friends with her and one of her kids, and it has become a fun inside joke between us!\n\n         <<Spoiler tags added>>\n         For those who have read it, you understand exactly what I mean.

I can definitely relate to that feeling of becoming so immersed in a book that it brings out strong emotions.\n\n        For me, it was Stephen King's \"The Green Mile.\" I read it back when I was in high school.\n\n        The story is about a Death Row guard on a 1930s prison, and he encounters a new inmate named John Coffey who has supernatural abilities. The characters and their relationships throughout the book make it such an emotional read. The ending got me good. It's one of those books that I think about years later and it still makes me feel something.\n\n        What emotional moments have you experienced while reading other books?

The way the author slowly unraveled the truth, revealing the characters' motivations and the depth of their emotional entanglements, was masterful. The climax was both heart-wrenching and surprising, and I remember finishing the book feeling a profound sense of loss and satisfaction. It's one of those experiences that still lingers in my memory, and I've often thought about revisiting that world and those characters.",

Perhaps the fantasy and escapism in those books helped me through some tough times as well. \n\nThanks for sharing your emotional book moment.

            "comment_text": "Hey there fellow bookworm. I've got a few emotional book moments as well. My first one was actually a book that wasn't a best-seller, but it stuck with me nonetheless. It was called \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" by Audrey Niffenegger. The main character, Clare, had a serious affliction - she would fall asleep and wake up in different time periods, from her own childhood to various points in the future, leaving her husband Henry stranded in time without her. Their love story was beautifully told and the poignant ending left me in a puddle of tears. I remember having to set the book down for a while before I could go on reading. It was one of those instances where the emotions the book elicited were almost overwhelming. How about you? Any other books that have moved you that you'd like to share?",

Even as a child, I found the relationship between the boy and the tree incredibly emotional. I feel like there's a certain melancholy in the story that's both beautiful and heartbreaking.\n\n        \n        It's always great to hear about books that have touched people on an emotional level.

It felt like the beginning of a journey, full of wonders and challenges that would test my patience and intellect. I became so engrossed in its teachings that I was constantly torn between savoring every bit of the knowledge and rushing to learn more. I found myself getting emotional and elated when I finally understood a difficult concept or a new reaction mechanism.

That book made me experience such a range of emotions, which was quite new for me as a young reader. It remains a profoundly impactful experience to this day.\n\nIf you haven't yet, I recommend giving Clan of the Cats by Gemmell a read as well. It offers a similar gut-wrenching journey, albeit from a different perspective.\n\nKeep sharing the books that moved you, my friend. It's wonderful to delve into the emotional connections one can make through good literature!\n\n(By the way,",

The protagonist, Jonas, is selected to be the next Receiver of Memories, tasked with carrying all the memories of pain, joy, fear, and love in all of humanity. The book takes a dramatic and heartbreaking turn as Jonas learns of a planned release of the memory of human destruction, which occurs just before the book ends.

The ending was really gut-wrenching and I had to put the book down for a while before I could pick it up again. \n\n        I remember feeling really emotional reading it, and it made me appreciate the time I had with my loved ones even more. I can still remember the sadness I felt when she died, and I still have that book on my shelf as a reminder of that time in my life.\n\n        It's interesting you mentioned \"Where the Red Fern Grows.\" I read that in school too, and I remember being really moved by the loss of the dogs. It was different from any other loss I had experienced, and it made me think about the bond we can have with animals.\n\n        Reading is such a great way to explore different emotions and perspectives",

The story follows two teenagers who meet in a cancer support group and develop an intense relationship. The book is heart-wrenching and beautifully written, and I still think about it to this day.\n\nIt's interesting that your girlfriend's bookstore has successfully sold books by a Japanese author. I've always wanted to know more about Japanese culture, so I might have to check out those titles!\n\nWhat other books have had a profound emotional impact on you? I'm always looking for new recommendations.",

                    "comment_text": "Oh, I absolutely love 'The Glass Bead Game' by Hermann Hesse! Your experience reading it sounds very moving. The scene where the protagonist's teacher, the musician, dies is definitely a powerful moment in the book. For me, that scene resonated because it evoked a sense of mortality and the passing of wisdom from one generation to another. That's why the description of the teacher's appearance feeling 'delicate, like the wings of a dragonfly' struck me so much. It feels like a fleeting and fragile moment, and yet beautiful in its own right. That scene, along with others, definitely left an emotional impact on me while reading the book.\n\n        \n        \n        Speaking of which, I do have another book that moved me in a similar way: 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy. It's a post-apocalyptic novel, and its bleak,",

The concept of unconditional love between the tree and the boy just really resonated with me. No matter how much the boy took from the tree, the tree always loved him unconditionally, and that selfless love is something I strive to emulate in my life. That book has always been a reminder for me to be more loving, more accepting, and more selfless, even when it seems tough or impossible. What emotional book has made the greatest impact on you?",
