    "content": "For me, it was really unexpected: \n\nThere was a fantasy series written by David Gemmell called the Drenai Saga, and its first book was called \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe main character was named Druss, and in the beginning of the book,  his wife gets kidnapped by raiders. The rest of the plot arc involves him pursuing her to get her back. There are multiple times where the action or plot arc comes to a head and then rips your heart out, especially towards the end, where he first reunites with his beloved. \n\nIt was the first time I remember, as an adult, not being able to put a book down, and feeling tears run down my face because I had come to care so deeply for all the characters. \n\nHow about you? I\u2019d love to hear about your emotional moments I reading, no matter what they are.\n",

He knows that they have his mother and his sister held prisoner so he sets off to his village to save them. His girlfriend wants to go with him to fight off the Whitecloaks but Perrin insists on going alone. Against his wishes, his girlfriend joins along with some warriors. He gets to the village and talks with the mayor in his home.!< >!Perrin explains his plan to save his family, turning himself in to the Whitecloaks. That is why he wanted to go alone. The mayor then explains that the Whitecloaks already killed Perrin's mother and sister. THE MOMENT WHEN HE FINDS OUT is what broke me. It's almost like he ignores it, sort of shrugging it off and bringing up other pressing matters. He then remembers small details about his mother and his sister, those memories interjected between his thoughts and his talking. The way it's written, I felt what Perrin felt, the disbelief. After more memories of his family floods his mind, he then finally cries. That is the fist time a book made me tear up. !<",

But I do have siblings that weren't raised on children's books about death and they didn't have as many conversations about it like I did because they came along after my mum was done with her education, and they have a lot more complicated relationship with death. They're more scared of death and dying and they take the losses we've had harder. And I think because I grew up with the topic starting when I was as young as I was I became comfortable with death being a part of life and my feelings and thoughts got sorted through and talked about with an adult in a safe happy environment. Whereas my siblings really only got those conversations and were faced with those thoughts in the middle of us loosing a grandparent when they were in their teens.

At the end of the book, one of the kids goes to a protest march at the capital with other illegal kids to demand the government recognize them as people with legal rights, and doesn't come back. Eventually, the kid who decided not to go sneaks over to her house and is found by the missing kids dad, who tells him that the government basically machine gunned all those kids, including his daughter. The kid who didnt go ends up getting a black market new identity from a couple who's own son died in a ski accident and leaves his family behind. I think it was my first book that didn't have a happy ending.",

Where the red fern grows. I think it hit so hard because I had recently lost my own first dogs the year before. Not in anyway so violent, but due to old age. The second one to go did look for her best friend for a while and little me did notice it. Which is why the death of the second dog was so troubling.

Spoiler: The protagonist has a teacher, a musician and at some point in the story this man dies. It is actually really peaceful. He just got really old and something about his appearance came off as really delicate at the end, like the wings of a dragonfly (might even be an indirect quote). He sees the protagonist one last time, but I believe it is as if his view already goes beyond him. Spoiler End When I first read the story I was really afraid of the death of my grandfather. And this section just hit right in this spot. I was on public transport at the time, leaning on the door, looking out the window and just started crying. The section was really sad and beautiful at the same time. Love that book. Even got an old copy from the 1940s I believe in Hesses favorite typeface (Unger Fraktur), rebound it and read it again. Maybe I'll reread it when spring arrives, my favorite time to read this book.",
