    "content": "What book(s) made you laugh the first time you read it and still do when you re-read them?  (If you do not re-read then just respond to the first part.)  I loved Gordon Korman growing up and still re-read some of them when I need some really light reading.  For instance, I Want To Go Home still makes me laugh continually throughout the book.  It is about a teenager who keeps trying to escape from an island summer camp he did not want to attend.  I find his incessant comments hilarious and still read this book at least once a year just for the laughs.",

When it was finally my turn, the venue people were locking the doors and turning the lights on. I somewhat sheepishly explained my predicament re:having nothing to sign, and David sorta frowned and said \"well, I don't sign other people's work, y'know, it's just...one of those things.\" I said I totally understood and that it was nice to meet him anyway. He goes \"hang on. I might have something that'll work.\" He goes into his messenger bag and produces, shit you not, a vintage medical textbook about burn wounds. He tears one of the pages out--it's got huge, graphic, black-and-white images of burned limbs all over it--and signs it \"to farmyardcat. I love your outfit.\"",

The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county.\u201d",

Of course, a sense of humor is highly subjective and you could literally find yourself the only one in the room laughing at Jimmy Carr (or NOT) or find Ricky Gervais' humor offensive, blasphemous, racist, degrading, misogynistic, antisemitic and outrageous (AND hilarious! ) OR NOT. It depends on your particular tastes and hypersensitivity, your mood at the current time, perhaps triggers of your own, whatever. And presentation by the story teller. Ever heard the same story told by two different storytellers when 1 is monotonous and lethargic and the other is ebullient and bracing; one of them you can barely sit through and the other you laugh til you cry? Rmbr the old adage, \"There's nothing new under the sun.\" The tale is in the telling. Shakespeare only wrote 1 original play, (loser!):The Tempest. Yet since he originally wrote them, his plays have NEVER BEEN OUT OF PRODUCTION. Just take a moment and think about that. In 400 years, since he wrote his plays, they have never, ever been out of production. That is something, huh? So, to ask which books make us laugh...I love dark humor, irreverent humor, Jimmy and Ricky humor, as well as cleaner, more family oriented humor as well, like Brian Regan. But FINALLY to answer your question (JEEZ, at LAST! what a frkn BLOWHARD! Iknowiknow, you ask a simple f'schtunkina question, and all you want is just a simple answer, not a treatise on...) Top of my list, as I said, has to be: \"Catch 22,\" then, maybe, \" The Sisters Brothers,\" (black humor, like I said; \" Almost anything by Science writer Mary Roach\" (yes, It's her real name. I'm sure that's enough for now. If you want more (W/O the long winded--ness, please just lemme know and I'll find more in my home library. Thanks so much. Your fellow bibliophile, -J-",
