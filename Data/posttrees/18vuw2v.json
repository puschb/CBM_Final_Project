I have been sleeping on Kingsolver and am now almost 20 years late to her work but I am so glad to have found it. Her books are so engrossing and I feel transported in time and space.\n\nI read Demon Copperhead because my mom could not stop talking about it and I devoured it in 2 days. Then someone on this subreddit recommend Poisonwood Bible as my next endeavor and I have finished that at a rate of knots too. I have Lacuna at home, collecting dust, and will go there immediately after my holiday.\n\nI just needed to share my love for this woman and her books, may she write many more!",

Demon Copperhead and Poisonwood Bible are indeed fantastic reads, and I'm sure you'll enjoy the various themes she explores and the engaging stories she tells.\n\nAs for Lacuna, it's a highly recommended novel that offers a unique perspective on memory and identity.

It's a brilliant exploration of religion, morality, and the consequences of cultural differences.\n    If you're looking for something more whimsical, I would suggest \"The Lacuna\" which is her latest novel.

It's a challenging read, but it's worth it to dive deeper into Kingsolver's themes.\n\nAs for your next Kingsolver read, I would suggest Lacuna.
