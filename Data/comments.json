Documents specified it was a red \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d cap, referencing Trump\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\n>It\u2019s against Texas election rules, however, to wear badges or attire referencing candidates or measures on the ballot while in a polling place. Salazar said a poll worker at Johnston Library reminded Lutzenberger about the rules, and he removed it before casting his ballot.\n\n>Upon leaving, however, Lutzenberger allegedly put the hat back on while still in the building. An election clerk \u201ctold him that was unacceptable,\u201d Salazar said, and began to escort him out. That\u2019s when Lutzenberger allegedly turned physical, throwing his arm and then \u201cseveral punches\u201d at the clerk before leaving.\n\n>Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s deputies investigated and took Lutzenberger into custody at his home Friday. He has since been released after posting bail on a $30,000 bond."
