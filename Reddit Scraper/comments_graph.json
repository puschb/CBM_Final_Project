Documents specified it was a red \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d cap, referencing Trump\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\n>It\u2019s against Texas election rules, however, to wear badges or attire referencing candidates or measures on the ballot while in a polling place. Salazar said a poll worker at Johnston Library reminded Lutzenberger about the rules, and he removed it before casting his ballot.\n\n>Upon leaving, however, Lutzenberger allegedly put the hat back on while still in the building. An election clerk \u201ctold him that was unacceptable,\u201d Salazar said, and began to escort him out. That\u2019s when Lutzenberger allegedly turned physical, throwing his arm and then \u201cseveral punches\u201d at the clerk before leaving.\n\n>Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s deputies investigated and took Lutzenberger into custody at his home Friday. He has since been released after posting bail on a $30,000 bond.",

When you report to a ballot location you vote precisely the same way you would vote on election day.\n\nSince this event happened in Texas, his vote wasn't sealed in an envelope they use a voting machine that involves dials. You rotate the dial around till it hits the way you'd like to vote and then select. You also have the option of straight party ticket voting.  Which sets everything to the party of your choice.\n\nFurther info: You were required to check in with your ID and they mark you off the list of people who are registered to vote in your district. Ironically some poll workers were unaware that a US passport counted as an ID.\n\nEdited: clarity. I vote from abroad now.",

Everyone voting early here will show an ID get put through an electronic voter system to make sure they didn't mail in a ballot. Signature gets checked on an electronic pad and their ballot is printed off to fill out. Nothing on the ballot identifies them. They drop it off in the tabulator which is a big bin. There is no order to them after they fall in.\n\nI understand mail in ballots having a signature on them. I have used them a bunch when overseas.",

You went to the voter registration, checked your name, showed your ID, went to the booths. At the booths you then used the dial to make your selections.
